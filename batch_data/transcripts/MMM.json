Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 24, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you, good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 business review. Inge and David will make some opening comments today and then we will take your questions. Before we begin I've a few brief announcements. Our remaining 2014 earnings calls are scheduled for Thursday, July 24, Thursday, October 23 and Thursday, January 29. Also, please hold the morning of Tuesday, December 16 on your calendars for our next investor meeting, the details of which will be available later this year. Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was strong for 3M; marked by organic growth in all business groups and across all geographic areas. We posted record sales in return record cash to shareholders, by also increasing investments in R&D and commercialization to reinforce our foundation for long-term success. Let's look at the few highlights earnings per share rose to $1.79, an 11.2% increase year-over-year. Sales were $7.8 billion the highest first quarter total in 3M history. Organic growth was 4.6% paced by our health care business at 6%. Industrial, Safety and Graphics each grew 5% organically. We saw organic growth in each geographic area led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada at 7% each. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 4% followed by the United States at 3%. I'm very encouraged by our continued broad based organic growth, which is more evident that is our strategies are working. Currency reduced sales by 2% in the quarter, which was about 1% points worse than our expectation entering the year. Operating margins were again strong at nearly 22% up 30 basis point from last year. Four of our five business groups reported margins greater than 21%. It remains a good time to be a 3M shareholder. The company returned $2.3 billion to its shareholders to cash dividends and share repurchases. We increased our first quarter dividend by 35%, which marked 56 consecutive annual increase. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to 2014. This is only possible because of the hard work of our entire 3M team on a global basis because of the efforts, we continue to deliver consistent and strong results today, while at the same time investing and building for the future. Now please turn to Slide number 4. With one quarter behind us, we are reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. Earnings per share are expected in the range to $7.30 to $7.55 with organic local-currency sales growth in the 3% to 6% range. We now anticipate foreign currency translation to reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, a slightly bigger headwind than previous expectations. Our tax rate estimate remains at 28% to 29% with cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%. David will now take you through the details of the first quarter. David? David Meline : Thank you, Inge. I'll begin by reviewing first quarter sales growth. Please turn to Slide number 5. Worldwide organic local-currency grew was 4.6% in the first quarter with volumes up 3.4% and selling prices up 1.2%. We continue to experience positive selling price changes across our businesses. Boosted by world-class innovation and strong new production flow both of which are important elements of the 3M business model. In addition, we've been raising prices in certain developing countries to help offset the impact of currency devaluations. Foreign exchange impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2% points in the first quarter and as Inge mentioned this was about 1% point worse than we expected at the beginning of the year. The most significant currency headwinds were in Latin America/Canada had negative 12% as several countries in the area experienced devaluations. Currency impacts were negative 4% in Asia Pacific and a positive 2% in EMEA. On the total US Dollar basis sales rose 2.6% versus the first quarter of 2013. Looking by area, demand accelerated in Asia Pacific in the first quarter with organic local currency growth of 7%. Growth was led by strong double-digit performance in Japan where demand was elevated leading up to the April consumption tax increase. China, Hong Kong grew 2% organically in Q1 or 8% excluding electronics. On a business basis, all five groups within Asia Pacific generated positive organic local currency growth in Q1 led by health care and safety and graphics. Latin America/Canada also grew 7% organically, a nice acceleration versus the fourth quarter. Growth was led by solid double-digit performances in Brazil and Mexico; our two largest Latin American subsidiaries in terms of sales. All five businesses posted positive organic growth in Latin America/Canada during the quarter including double-digit growth in health care. Electronics and energy also posted solid organic, local-currency growth in the area. In Venezuela, we continue to manage through the economic turbulence and position our business for future success. Sales and profits were down substantially in Venezuela during the quarter. We continue to manage our exposures carefully and we will stay on this path until the situation improves. For some time now, we have been actively managing towards a neutral net monitory asset position in Venezuela and at this point, it appears that any major event risk is behind us. Organic sales growth in EMEA was 4% in the first quarter continuing the positive trends that we have seen over the past few quarters. West Europe grew 3% with strong performances in Nordic, Alpine and Iberia regions. Middle East Africa also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. On a business basis, growth in EMEA was strongest in industrial and in safety and graphics. In the United States organic local-currency growth was 3% in the quarter, which was a bit slower than the growth we saw in the second half of 2013. It does appear that weather negatively impacted certain channels that we serve in the US, particularly in road construction, retail and industrial distribution. On the positive side, health care posted the strongest US growth amongst our five businesses. Organic local-currency growth was nearly 5% across all developing markets and 4.5% in developed markets and again as Inge mentioned organic growth was positive across all major geographic areas. Let's turn to Slide number 6, for discussion of the first quarter income statement. Sales for the quarter were $7.8 billion up 2.6% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 3.7% to $3.8 billion and gross margins increased 0.5% points to 48.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 20 basis points to 5.8%. Operating income increased by just over 4% versus the first quarter of 2013. GAAP operating margins were 21.9% up 30 basis points year-on-year. Organic volume growth added 30 basis points to margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed a positive 110 basis points year-on-year. And inherent part of 3M's business model is to leverage productivity and other gains to fund strategic investments, while continuing to generate premium returns. This is seen again in our first quarter numbers. We invested the equivalent of 90 basis points of margin on incremental programs around disruptive R&D, business transformation, and ERP, and restructuring. In particular, we invested $40 million on restructuring and other realignment efforts in Q1 across a number of business units. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expense boosted first quarter margins by 50 basis points, while foreign exchange impacts reduce margins by 50 basis points. All in first quarter earnings increased 11% to $1.79 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced first quarter earnings per share by $0.04 and the lower tax rate resulted in a $0.04 per share benefit. As a result of our announced changes in capital structure strategy, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share. In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year in 2014. Organic sales growth was broadly positive across businesses and geographies. Margins were strong overall and we expect this performance to continue into the future. Now let's turn to cash flow, turning to Slide number 7. As a reminder for those, who are new to 3M; we announced at our December 2013 Investor Meeting, our plans to manage towards a better optimized capital structure going forward, and to allocate capital accordingly. The strength and stability of our business model and strong free cash flow capability, enables us to enact this changes while continuing to invest in our businesses. Organic growth remains our first priority, so we will continue to invest in CapEx, R&D and commercialization capability. In addition, we're already enabled to respond to strategic acquisition opportunities that can strengthen our portfolio, and at the same time our plan affords us the opportunity to return significant cash to shareholders. We communicated our intent to implement these changes to our capital structure overtime. For the calendar year 2014 in particular, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion on the balance sheet. So now let's discuss our cash flow performance for the first quarter. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter up $98 million versus last year's first quarter. Higher net income drove the line share of the increase. Capital expenditures were $293 million, a decrease of $31 million versus last year. We continue to expect full year CapEx will be in the range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. First quarter free cash flow was $799 million, up $129 million year-on-year and we converted 66% of net income to cash versus 59% in last year's comparable quarter. Note that, first quarter is typically our seasonal low with respect to free cash flow conversion. For the full year 2014, we expect to be in the range 90% to 100%. We paid $566 million in cash dividends during the quarter up substantially over the $440 million paid in 2013. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 35%. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the first quarter for 2014 we expect full year gross share repurchases will be in the range $4 billion to $5 billion. Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go the Slide number 8. Our industrial business posted strong first quarter results with $2.8 billion in sales and 5% organic local currency growth. Leading the way this quarter was our 3M Purification business which drove strong double-digit organic growth. This business has gained significant traction around the globe, as we expand our technology capability and product offerings. We also generated double-digit organic growth in automotive OEM, which was more than twice the rate of growth in global auto production. Our advanced materials and industrial abrasive businesses also posted nice first quarter organic growth. Industrial sales grew broadly across all geographic areas during the quarter. Organic local currency sales growth was 6% in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in the US. First quarter operating income was $618 million up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3%. Margins were boosted by volume leverage, positive price raw's and good productivity, partially offset by restructuring cost. We also improved margins year-on-year in Ceradyne, a business we acquired in late 2012 which added 30 basis points to industrial margins in Q1. Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter with organic local currency sales growth of 5%. Our largest business here is personal safety, which generated double-digit organic local-currency growth. We also grew in a roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Sales in traffic safety and security systems declined slightly on organic basis, impacted by slow start to the road construction season. Safety and graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas with Asia Pacific up 9%, Latin America/Canada and EMEA each up 5% and the US up 2%. Operating income was $318 million in the first quarter and operating margin were a solid 22.3%, although margins were down year-on-year versus a very strong comp. Major factors impacting, this quarter's margins were higher ERP investment, restructuring and negative currency impacts. Please go to Slide 10. Our health care business once again delivered outstanding results. It was our fastest growing and highest margin business group in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion and increased 6% in organic local currency terms. All businesses contributed this growth in the first quarter led by health information systems, food safety and drug delivery systems. All geographic areas generated positive organic local-currency sales growth with Latin America/Canada up 12%. Asia Pacific up 10%, the US up 7% and EMEA up 2% in the quarter. In developing markets health care grew 10% organically in the first quarter, yet another in a long string of double-digit performances. First quarter operating income in health care was $427 million and operating margins increased 30 basis year-on-year to 31.1%. Now let's look at electronics and energy found on Slide 11. First quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion up 4% in organic local-currency terms. Electronics related sales increased 5% on an organic local-currency basis with positive growth in optical films partially offset by declines in other businesses. In our energy related business, sales increased 2% organically led by renewable energy in telecom. On a geographic basis organic local-currency sales increased 9% in Latin America/Canada and 7% in Asia Pacific. EMEA was down slightly and the United States declined 4% year-on-year. Operating income rose 16% to $227 million and operating margins were 17.3%. Margins in this business continue to track higher rising 2 points year-on-year and 60 basis points sequentially. Volume leverage and improving productivity were both positive contributors to first quarter margins. Finally, let's review the consumer business found on Slide number 12. Sales in the consumer business grew $1.1 billion with organic local-currency growth of 3%. Sales in our stationary and office supply business declined versus last year's first quarter. Store traffic in the US office retail channel was softer in the quarter, due in part to harsh winter weather conditions along with continued store consolidations. Our construction and home improvement business which serves the DIY retail market space led consumer's growth this quarter with high single-digit organic local currency sales growth. Over the years, we have built strong market positions in categories such as Filtrete brand, home furnace filters, Scotch-Brite, painters tape and Command brand mounting and fastening products, which provide a strong foundation for consistent strong growth. On a geographic basis, organic local-currency growth was 6% in Asia Pacific, 5% Latin America/Canada and 1% each in the US and EMEA. Operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 21.2%, that concludes my first quarter related comments and I'll turn the call back over to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you David. As you can see, the year is off to a good start. We continue to execute well against our long-term strategic levels, which I would like to update you on. Let's first start with portfolio management. In the first quarter, we realigned and combined certain businesses to increase customer relevance, build scale and generate cost efficiency. In the Safety and Graphic business group, we merged commercial graphics and building and commercial services into newly formed commercial solutions division. This brings a comprehensive array of branding, design, protection and maintenance solutions under one division allowing us to present one strong voice to the commercial markets customers. Earlier this month, we also further realigned our electronics related businesses to more effectively position them to accelerate growth. We are now organizer on two large divisions. One is display materials and systems, which consolidates all of 3M's capabilities in electronic displays. [Batteries] electronics material solutions which aligns our offerings in semi-conductor electronic materials and components. This changes will better align our capabilities with customers needs and expand our leadership in this area. Also in April, 3M acquired Treo Solutions, a leader in the health care, data analytics. This will bolster our health information system business by allowing it to supply customers with better solutions at lower cost. Let's talk about the second lever, investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It drives what we do every day and allow us to create even greater value for customers. Innovation generates new growth and is the key to our long track record of generating premium returns throughout the business. In fact, one-third of our revenue in 2013 came from products created in the last five years and we are targeting 37% by 2017. And we expanding our innovation capabilities globally, we have now built 45 innovation centers around the world, where customer gain exposure to the breadth of our technology. Our international labs are also typically staffed and led by local nationals and our commitment to innovation helps 3M recruit some of the best and brightest scientists from all over the globe. It's notable that 47% of our new products launched in 2013, were led by international labs up from 37% just a few years ago. The results were strong with more opportunities still to come. Now let's talk about the third lever; business transformation. We continue to make progress on implementing our global ERP system, which will lead to more a ideal and efficient 3M. To-date, we have gone live in five countries with more schedule for 2014. Most recently, we launched is it, that is in one of our European distribution center based in Dabrowa, Poland. We are learning more with each implementation on using that knowledge to guide and refined our future work. There is one final point I'd like to make before taking your questions. When we last met in January, I talked a bit about our 3M manage to a volatility in developing markets. Given down certainties in some areas of the world today. I like to expand a bit upon that discussion. We have a deep history in developing nations. 3M entered Brazil in 1946 and a year later, 1947 in Mexico. With that history comes wealth of experience and business teams that know how to be successful in those areas. This is also the model; we are using in Central East Europe, Middle East, Africa and APAC. This is the 3M international model. We enter early, develop connections grow our customer base and steadily build capability. We staff our management teams with local nationals, people who know the country, culture and customers and of course speak the language. As with any growth opportunity, there are going to be challenges along the way and developing markets are no exception, yet when these challenges arise we do not abandon our customers or the market. Our leaders know how to manage through them, knowing from experience that 3M will emerge even stronger with a more established presence and more loyal customer base. Our approach continue to produce strong results including this year's first quarter. In Brazil, as one example we grew 11% organically and in Mexico 15% and we see developing countries coming back in terms of growth rate. Developing markets in total represents 35% of 3M's sales today and we expect that number to keep climbing. Thank you for your attention and with that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Good morning, just a broad question. As I look at 3M, you guys delivered another quarter of some of the best top line growth in the industry and if you look at the margin expansion. You're actually starting to get it, but then if you look at the operating line the leverage seems to be limited and I understand it's a functional some of it discretionary spending that you guys are doing. So two questions; A, what is the level, what is run rate of discretionary spending that we should be expecting for the rest of the year? And second a broader question, sort of 3M seems to be a combo and industrial company and a consumer company, but your operating leverage now behaves a lot more like consumer company than an industrial company. Do we get sort of operating leverage on the industrial side by some point this year? Thank you. David Meline : Yes, thanks Andrew. So in terms of the leverage we get from growth. We saw in the first quarter, I think very typical of what we've expect from the overall business which is somewhere 35% to 40% operating leverage on the growth that we got and what's true as you pointed out and as we had planned, we do plan to reinvest a significant portion of that in some of these key strategic investments through 2014. So we have said in the beginning of the year that we expect to invest in these investments program somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20 during the year and we invested $0.07 a share in the first quarter. So we still expect to invest at that $0.10 to $0.20 range probably towards the high end, the way it looks right now, but what you can expect through the year is that you'll see some moderation of that spending. So obviously, the business transformation and the R&D investment is pretty steady through the year. We also invested, we did some restructuring in the first quarter that we'll look at each quarter and determine, whether or not there are projects that we should undertake and also some of the spending was in this European supply chain center of excellence, which will lap that spending here as we move into the second quarter. Andrew Obin : Just on structural, I understand that you need to invest and it's part of the culture, but as I said should we see more operating more top line dropping to the bottom line in the second half of the year, is that a reasonable expectation given what you've stated? David Meline : Yes, I mean if you look at the plan we laid out for the year. What you could foresee, is that we will some inept increase in our margins for the year, which we did see already here in the first quarter. So I think it's fair to assume that will continue as we look through the full year. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : The 50 basis point increase in gross margin and when I look at the gross margin overall. The highest, I think since that was 6 certainly for a long time and you peaked in that earlier time period over 50%. I know we are having sort of the discussion about investments below the gross margin line, but is most of that increase on the pricing versus raw material front and how do you think about this sustainability. I mean clearly you have a lot of pricing power and you're making up for some inflationary issues, but when you sort of look at your material cost position, cost out and continue pricing efforts, are there other things going on there in the volume leverage etcetera and we can sort of see that number also continue to tick up for some time. David Meline : You're right, Steve. We were encouraged this quarter by the improvement in our gross margin which seasonally for us, the first quarter is usually the lowest of the year. So that was encouraging, if we look year-over-year. What's true, it's a combination of several factors. Certainly productivity features in that and you've heard us really focus in these last couple of years around the rejuvenation and taking segment to the next level and, so we are seeing I think some of that coming through. Certainly, we've been working the portfolio to focus resources where the best opportunities are and I think that's certainly contributing to the overall gross margin profitability of the company and then finally, there certainly as you know and as you pointed out. There is component of price in raw material that's supporting this. On the pricing side, we had quite strong pricing in the first quarter down a little bit from the fourth quarter but nonetheless quite strong at 1.2% and if you'll look at about half of was that attributable to the freshness of the product portfolio and really the price value relationship that our customers described to those products and the other half, was largely attributable to offsetting the foreign exchange movements in particular in the emerging market. So as a combination of several factors, but obviously it's something we continue to focus on and seek to improve. Steven Winoker : That's great and Inge. You've talked less about it, yet another organizational set of changes internally that just sound like a continued large transformation going on. Are these latest ones that you talked about today? I mean, how much \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s all channel driven but you're also going reap some cost synergy benefits from it? So there are other elements besides the channel and customer facing front here that will be, we can see the benefits from overtime? Inge Thulin : First of all, if you go back when we lay out our six new strategies when I took office. A little bit more than two years ago, the first strategy is to calling out relevance to customers and this is the implementation of that. So when you have the strategy, you need to follow through in order to make sure that you on the way to obtain your overall or be active. So some of this changes that we've done is clearly based on relevance to customers for us to be able to respond faster based on their needs, where you know as you know that our technology platforms are very important and we need to be able to respond fast back to them based on solutions, we are working with them. In my mind, as we not have looked into the organization structure maybe for almost 10 years, there was some disconnect in between our internal organization in the market, so we are addressing that. And of course, so drive it first from relevance to customer, to market, but there is also cost benefits of course into organization structure, as you make those moves because you reduced specifically in the back office and in the middle management, where you can reduce cost and be more ideal and so forth. So if you think about it from a speed perspective because we would like to accelerate speed in terms of responsiveness to customers. We have in some parts of the world, that we have not talked about now for long time also consolidate subsidiaries into region in the part of West Europe and we have done in Latin America, etc. So if you think about that, well you now have connection points where we previously in some cases said three sizeable but not huge divisions that needed to interact. For instance, in Nordic with four different countries where we today have one-to-one. So you have one huge division totally focused in market space and you have one geographical area in Nordic that's incredible move and shift if you think about speed in order to execute, when you went from three Vice President's back in St. Paul and four Managing Director, Nordic. Now you go one-for-one, I can tell you that has an incredible impact on the organization in terms of speed as we move ahead. So look upon it like increased relevance in the front end for the customers and for us also to be able to leverage cost in our structure both in international and in the center of the organization. Steven Winoker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Inge and David, are you able to break out the weather impacts in Q1 and if so, how much of those are permanent and how much will be recaptured in future quarters? Inge Thulin : Well first of all, it's difficult in a way to talk about it because we are global company. So some places around the world, the weather was okay. So I think and you think about it that was some impact in United States and United States is 35% of our business. So it's difficult for us to quantify it, but of course we had some impact of it in United States specifically and it was related to as David said, was traffic in the stores was down which had an impact on our consumer business and that was also delayed in some of the construction and specific relative to traffic, safety and road safety. If you take road safety and traffic safety. I think that will come back. It's a timing issue, so we will get that back as we go. If you go into the combination of the lower traffic in the stores the first quarter that's maybe gone but we will compensate that in a different way, but you know we don't talk much about weather to be honest, right it's -- we are global company and the sun is always shining somewhere and that is what we need to capitalize on. David Meline : If I can, just add briefly David. So if you will look at the US from a trend growth perspective. We saw in the second half of last year, we grew around 4.5% during that period and we've got guidance in place for the year of 3% to 6% for the US and we grew 3% in the first quarter. So it feels to us, the guidance is still right and that we will some recovery, as we move through the year. David Begleiter : And just lastly, of the two segments posted year-over-year or any declines in safety and consumer. Do you think they can return to earnings growth in second quarter? David Meline : Yes, we think that we've got and outlook for both of those businesses to grow again with the average of the company for the year in the 3% to 6% and we think that their margins will operate around the company average, so that would imply some improvement in consumer and probably in the safety and graphics. If you look seasonally, they run a little bit lower in the first quarter typically anyway. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Do you guys, when you think about pricing. I think 3M has a history of being pretty good on price particularly the last five years or so, but is there a trade-off that you see, a clear trade-off between price and volume. Do you have a sense, that you're giving up volume and do you have so much pricing power in most of your businesses that it's fairly immaterial that, it's more of a next issues, it's just a better product. Inge Thulin : Yes, we don't feel at this point in time that we are giving up volume. You have to think about it in terms of our position in the market and all the new products that we are introducing, as many of them are based [specking] on platforms etc. So I will not say that, we're at this point in time or giving up anything that we are aware of and as you know, our power in terms of pricing is pretty strong. And it's all based on, of the value of the solution that we are providing. So I think that's important, so I don't think that's a issue. If we had been, we had not continued to execute based on our strategy in that area. I think it's more in terms of you talking about growth generally speaking, is maybe in some part of in the developing world that we will add different type of products and solutions that on meeting. I will say that, their price points and affordability in that part of the world, but that's a different discussion because that's more around the product portfolio that you're introducing in developing economies and I think that, we still have huge opportunities and as you heard, I talked about now that we have build out our capabilities with 45 customer technical centers around the world, that's exactly what we can capitalize on. So for us, it's important to make sure that we develop product that are adding value but also affordable for that market but we still have a very high expectation relative to our margins in the company and we are not giving up on that. So you should earn your right in order to introduce products with lower margin. You have to find a different way to produce them and make sure that you get the margins that we expect and that we can prospect you as a shareholder. Scott Davis : Okay, that's a good answer. It seemed in this presentation as I'm looking at Slide 7. There's new emphasis not a new I should say, but at least an increased emphasis on acquisitions. You cite that, there's a line here says, multibillion dollar deals possible. When I think of 3M and your margin profile and the technology you're having. The stuff available out there realistically that you could buy without having to pay enormous multiples and I think 3M type of assets. The things have been bid up so highly 15 to 20 times EBITDA. I mean, it would be difficult to do this types of deals. I would image but, is it realistic to it to assume that you can find things that are interesting that have the margin structure and the growth structure that you're looking for? Inge Thulin : Well again, it's coming but first of all you're right when you correct yourself. It's not the new emphasis. We've done acquisition, quite a number of acquisitions over the years, right? I think the new one and very good thing for all of us is that based on the portfolio management, we are putting place. We get a very good profile of where we should invest first, there's a second as we move ahead. I think the biggest acquisition 3M had done over is a $1 billion or so and in some spaces in order for us to be more relevant. We maybe need to do slightly bigger than that, as we move ahead. As you saw, we didn't execute on acquisitions last year and the reason for that was that, we couldn't find any added value for all of us, but I can tell you our pipeline is strong. We are working it for each business and let's see what is happening as we move ahead, but in order for us to build out relevance in some cases. We have to look up interesting spaces first. David Meline : I guess, I would also add Scott that. I mean, it would be quite unusual as you observe that we would find companies that have the type of profitability in performance that 3M, but that's very typical. We'll look at targets will identify, how we can create value by bringing them into the portfolio and leverage either technologies or brands our global distribution and when we do those transactions litmus test for us, is to become convinced ourselves that we can take a business and turn it into a 3M like performing business, which we've done very successfully over the years in a number of different instances. So that's either the challenge or the opportunity certainly. Scott Davis : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan: Just maybe a little bit more on some of the moving parts on managing currency in the quarter. I mean, first of all, to get to this neutral position in Venezuela, did you have to take a head to get your remaining receivable out of there and then the positive price in Asia Pac, which never happens, is that an FX dynamic? David Meline : First on Venezuela, yes we actually as I mention in the commentary. We did see a slowdown in sales and income that we generated on the ground, in that the availability of currency of imports is been pretty non-existent since already the fourth quarter. So that caused to slowdown in the business, what's also true for us as we've been able to maintain as I mentioned here neutral monetary asset position and therefore as it relates to both the local balance sheet as well as the exposure we've got from offshore. We were able to manage through that and we don't see that being risk as we sit here today and of course things can always change, but we feel much better today than we did last time we were on the call, there months ago. And then in Asia Pacific, could you repeat the question? Shannon O'Callaghan: Well, I mean price was positive in Asia Pac, which is pretty unusual, I didn't know if that was in price increase related to offsetting some type of FX or that's unrelated. David Meline : We have had some pricing pressure in some of the countries out of experienced evaluation over the last year. So that would be a portion and what's also true right now is in a number of our product areas. The price value relationship of some of the new product, we are launching is been very strong. So we were encouraged by the performance there this quarter. Shannon O'Callaghan: Just on kind of your current assessment of the global economy. Volumes in every region except the US improved this quarter. US sounded like it was mainly weather related, are you encouraged by that? I mean do you feel like improving momentum or is it more of a comp thing. Maybe just a little more color about what you're hearing from the businesses globally and how encouraged you might be or not be? Inge Thulin : Well I think, first of all of course encouraged in the way that the growth is, it looked like steady for us. Now if you look upon our performance here the last couple of quarters, it have improved for us right and as you say, it's going up and down in some parts of the world. I will say that, APAC it came back slightly. So APAC is, I would say the same position as we've had before. They had a good growth in the quarter for us slightly better than Q1 and how they ended a year. West Europe grew 3%, which is equal to how they ended back 2013, so that's a 3% and it looked like the combination in Europe, what we've talked about before about North and South is not very much equalized, right. So looked like 3% is steady growth there. Central East Europe, Middle East. I was certain Middle East, Africa had a good growth for Central East Europe slightly lower in the quarter where you could see that some business or countries did well like Turkey had higher growth rate than you saw in Russia and Poland. United States personally, I'm not overly concerned was 3% growth for the quarter. We start at slower and came back stronger in the quarter and that's related to what David talked about relative to traffics and stores and delay in construction. Specifically in the road side for us. So I think its look like we are going sideways slightly, up but not much, right? So I think we need, neither one but two quarters here to see, if it's moving on a high run, but as we said we are firming our growth rate for the year. So we feel, yes there you have the answer. Encouraged and I look upon it, rather better than was. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ajay Kejriwal : So on health care, you're continuing to see very nice growth here in developing markets and I know in the past, you've talked about new products and penetration and all that. So maybe just, help us with, where are you in terms of penetration. How much runway do still have there and the sense of sustainability of this double-digit growth rate that you're seeing here? Inge Thulin : Well, as you saw health care grew 6%, right? And if you separate out developed was 5% and developing 10%. And you think about the mix for us, it's like developed is almost 80% and we are 20% in developing. So already there, you have the answer relative to big opportunity in the developing world, as we move ahead. Now we have very sophisticated solutions in our business in health care, which is one of the reason why we are able to continue to grow in developed word and to very attractive margins and the pipeline of new products is very strong for us in health care, if that's in hospital consumables with fastening systems related to our dressing business or if it's in infection prevention, we're becoming new measurements tools start that will increase the time for measuring what they're doing in the infection area by 50%. We have a very strong pipeline of product going on there. So I will say that, think about it like developed word, we are able to continue our growth and margins due to very good added value products, which is needed in an environment where there is pressure on cost and then in the developing word for us it to, start to implement the penetration plans that we now have been working on for quite some time and in addition developed products that will meet the needs from a price perspective in some of the countries there. They never have a problem with a quality of products, as you assume. When you look upon our Tegaderm products, or Micropore tapes or [indiscernible] products. The problem is never quality, the problem is affordability and there is different ways for us to go around that. So we are very, we see very positive on our health care business and as you see again this quarter very good result and it's not by accident. You know, as you said business we are build out for many, many years and there is lot to come relative to our future in health care. David Meline : I'd just add, Ajay. I think another piece of evidence that supports that is not only the consistent high level of growth, but again for example this quarter double-digit growth in a number of different countries Brazil, Mexico. If you're looking Southeast Asia, if you're looking China. So if you saw it in one place concentrated you might be less confident but as we see it individually across all of these markets. It's very encouraging as to the opportunity and sustainability of the growth. Ajay Kejriwal : That's good. Maybe couple clarifications on restructuring you mentioned $40 million investment in the quarter. Is that included in the $0.07 growth related investment you mentioned and then if you can help us with a full year number, what should be modeling in for restructuring? David Meline : Yes, so the answer first of all is yes inside of the $0.07 the share, we have $40 million. It was a combination of restructuring primarily in some of our operations in Europe as well as the cost year-over-year increase of this European supply chain which as I mentioned will lap that increase, now as we get into the second quarter. So that's piece one. Piece two is; if you look at the total of the combination of the longer term investments in R&D and business transformation plus these items of restructuring and repositioning. We expect that, we had said $0.10 to $0.20 a share for the year and as I mentioned earlier, it looks now like will be towards the high end of that $0.20 range, with some front loading in the first quarter. So you can think about it declining somewhat, as we move through the year. Ajay Kejriwal : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Just two quick cleanups for me. First on electronics, you noted China, Hong Kong was kind of strong ex-electronics but your electronics performance overall actually looked okay, pretty decent. Can you just kind of reconcile those dynamics and a little more color on what's going on in the electronics part of the business? Inge Thulin : Look upon electronics specifically relative to APAC in total. So we had 5% growth there and that business is type of moving in between countries from time-to-time. So for China and Japan specifically was type of opposite perspective. They have [coms], that in one case was easy and the other case was tough. So easier for Japan, tougher for China so that's the answer and then this quarter specifically much more business went into Japan in terms of our sales but later converting around Asia. So that's the answer to that question. So if you take China for us, best business there was 8% growth which is slightly better than fourth quarter for us and slightly better year-on-year. So China was okay, when you look up the total electronic markets. When we look upon semi-conductor, data storage, smartphone, notebook, tablets, T.V., etc. The market generally speaking went sideways I think in terms of volume. That, you had of course tables going up and capitalize on notebooks in terms of the volume generally speaking. So for us, we are in all those devices with different type of levels of penetration, but that business is improving generally speaking and I would say, if you take the whole business group of the electronic and energy. You saw they had growth and they have margin expansion of 200 basis points year-on-year. So it's we are coming around and addressing a lot of issues in that business and I'm personally very encouraged and I think that management team guys doing a super job for us addressing some of issues we've had in the past. So I think, it's good we are addressing it and they're taking care of their own destiny and I'm very pleased to see that happening. Jeff Sprague : Right and just a quick one for David then also. You've initially guided your tax rate, assuming the R&D tax extenders and everything came through, it looks like they won't but you've found a way to maintain the tax rate guidance. What is going on there, is it some of the restructuring Europe maybe just a comfort level also on that tax guidance at this point? David Meline : Yes, so if you look at the guidance we maintained the 28% to 29% for the year and that does continue to presume that we see a renewal sometime before year end of the R&D tax credit, which is worth about 40 basis points to us. So both of those we continue to foresee and then we saw some, first quarter was a little bit better than the overall full year, which was related to, we completed some prior year audits and we ended up releasing some reserves that we'd established, so that's the answer to the question. Jeff Sprague : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Just again cleanups I guess, so David you mentioned roughly half of the price increases is a function of the currency weakness particularly in Latin America. So one thing about the, 110 bips benefit from price roll seeing your margin build and 50 bips from FX pinch. Is it that a phase, the impact currency net-net is neutral to margins? Inge Thulin : No actually. And then we try to call it out, we had a net impact of FX in the quarter of 50 basis points in that. David Meline : Nigel, if you look on the income statement Slide with the margin block, you'll see it right on there. Nigel Coe : Right, but then 110 bips from price, in some ways a function of currency and then you got pricing. Inge Thulin : Sorry, Nigel. So the 110 is both price and raw's. Right? David Meline : Yes. Inge Thulin : So raw material cost for us were down around 2% year-over-year, so that contributed to the 110 and then as you correctly pointed out, as I said the portion of price that remains of that 110. It's more or less 50/50 this quarter. So there is certainly some offset, to be honest I don't have top of mind, is it precisely a full offset. I think it's a little less than that. Nigel Coe : No, that's really helpful and then the second part of my question was, you talked about raw materials were down 2%. You've got to say, opposite side different mix of raw material input and most of the things as we look at so, do you expect [indiscernible] generally speaking how that raw material in nexus tracking, particularly as we go into second quarter? And as we set on track for the roughly $0.10 of benefits from roadmaps this year? David Meline : Yes, so that's right. So starting out. We have guided $0.05 to $0.15 of raw material cost benefit for the year versus last year. Certainly in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the performance in that area and that's a combination of not only the trends on raw materials cost themselves, but also to the extent that are efforts to identify alternative formulations to lower our raw material cost and change the composition to the extent that. We have efforts that would actually lower the amount of raw materials in a products. These types of things are included in that performance and the good news, as our sourcing organization continues to do a really job in that area. So we feel good about the guidance on raw materials for the year. If anything, if I were to pick it the trend. It appears to be trending towards the high end of that range for the year. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the look forward into the second quarter. Maybe some commentary on how April has played out so far and David, are there any dynamics we should know about specially following up on Jeff's question on tax, a bit of a benefit this year with those releases. Anything unique about the tax or corporate expense for the second quarter? David Meline : Okay, in terms of, first one was what again? So in terms of the trends on volume in revenue. If you look, if you look at the first quarter first of all, typically March is our strongest month in that quarter, which turned out to be the case for us again this year and maybe a little bit stronger, slightly stronger than typical intra-quarter pattern. If we look at second quarter, we feel good about the overall view that will continue to operate. We said 3% to 6% for the year, which is a mid-point of 4.5%, which is exactly where we operated if you look at the second half of last year, we ran at 4.5% first quarter. We now ran at 4.5% and we feel good about second quarter continuing at that rate. Pluses and minuses, we've kind of inferred that we some level of optimism about the US. They're also areas of uncertainty and certainly places like Japan which is a very significant business for 3M. We did see a pull forward, it was quite clear pull forward of sales into the first quarter result of the tax increase. So I would say pluses and minuses. April started out fine so, we feel good about stable performance for the company. In terms of taxes, we had little over 27% rate in the first quarter, which was closing out some prior year audits and included in that there was a particular case, that we benefited from where, we were able to treat as deductible assets, some assets that had been previously disallowed. So that was a one-time occurrence for us in the first quarter which given that rate in the first quarter solidifies the view that for the year, we can operate at 28% to 29% and I don't see any unusual patterns that we would foresee quarter-by-quarter through the balance of the year. Deane Dray : Great, that's helpful. Thank you. David Meline : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Two quick questions; first on pricing. The currency fluctuations is notwithstanding, it still seems like you're getting 50 to 60 basis points in price and David, if I'm correct with your raw mat guidance, you're now. Do you think it's probably going to be trending towards another 50 to 60 basis points in the raw mat benefit for the remainder of the year? So is there any reason to believe, that you're not going to get at least price cost benefit of 1 point for the remaining three quarters? David Meline : What we expect price cost for the balance of the year. What we have guided originally was on pricing that we thought, it will be very modest for the year. Obviously, with the stronger first quarter performance significantly supported by the fact that we were having to offset foreign exchange. We expect that pricing performance to decline through the year, but nonetheless be positive and then on the raw material side, as I have already indicated I'm expecting if we look at that $0.05 to $0.15 range we set out for the year. I'm expecting that right now as we see it will trend towards the high end of that range. I think from that, you can probably get to the specifics that you were just asking about. Joe Ritchie : Okay and just a follow-up on that a little bit. You [indiscernible] 60 basis points potentially extra currency this quarter. You're continuing to invest at a higher rate on R&D, so is there any reason to believe that pricing should step down for the rest of the year. On just not thinking that. David Meline : Yes, it's a good question. I mean we have a number of actions that are calendar year based and so what we do expect is that, we will see some decline through the year, which I why we had originally guided that. It would be modest price impact on the core base. Joe Ritchie : Just one question on the buyback, it looks like the gross buyback this quarter was around $1.7 billion. I think your guidance for the year was $3 billion to $5 billion. So perhaps, one if you can just comment on what the net buyback was for the quarter and then also what would get you to maybe flex the $3 billion to $5 billion higher in the coming quarters. David Meline : Sure. So first of all the next buyback in the first quarter was $1.4 billion against the $1.7 billion gross. If you paid attention of the trends over the last couple of years, what's happened is, we've substantially seen a reduction of the outstanding on exercised option. So that's cut about an half over the last several years. So that will cause our net to be much closer to gross than it has been in the past. So that's one of the reasons, why we see it much closer this quarter. Secondly, in terms of the overall gross for the year. Basically the way I think about this is, if we go back to the fact that what we said we would do now, is we would move our capital structure to be better optimized going forward. And so we are starting to allocate the capital to put that in place and that started last year as we drew on cash. This year, we've said we would increase our leverage by $2 billion to $4 billion and if you look in the first quarter with the actions that we took, our leverage went up by about $1 billion against the $2 billion to $4 billion guidance for the year. So it's right in line what we'd indicated we would be doing and we also did modify the outlook for the year on the gross buyback to $4 billion to $5 billion from $3 billion to $5 billion based on, the fact when we add up all the pluses and minuses. We concluded that would be the right level for us here in 2014. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. David Meline : Sure. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Since you're open to looking at multibillion dollar acquisitions. I don't think you've ever done a hostile, but we've had this due development of using activists to facilitate big acquisitions, is that something that would be too aggressive for someone like 3M to consider? Inge Thulin : First of all, thank you for the question. I don't think that's the way you should move forward and when you look upon those type of things. We will like to do, strategically important acquisitions that would add value for everyone involved including 3M and our shareholders and the customers that was part of that. So I think that should be done in very careful way as we move ahead. David Meline : Yes, if I could add. Our experience \u2013 a couple of comments there; one is we did indicate at year end that as we looked at on our own capital deployment and looked at our capability both in terms of our performance on businesses we've been acquiring in recent years as well as the integration capability that we put in place to ensure that we will continue to have good performance going forward and given the size of the company and how we are deploying capital, our conclusion was it would be appropriate for us to no limit the scope of acquisitions to say $1 billion or less, which is been the history of the company. So hence, we indicate that we would be open to doing things larger than a $1 billion because likewise we don't like to surprise people, as we take action. So that's one piece of our thinking. In terms of the subject of hostile versus non-hostile. What I would tell you is that, one of the advantages we have as a company is typically. When we do approach companies with the possibility of acquiring, the reaction is typically very good because 3M is known be the kind of company that invests to build businesses and therefore, we found that generally speaking the reaction is good and that's our preference to take that type of approach frankly, if you think about the culture and a company that makes sense to us. We are about building businesses here and that's we would continue to plan to do. John Roberts : As I look across the portfolio. It seemed to me, the electronic and energy area might be the one that could benefit most from a major acquisition. Maybe the scale might help with the margin improvement, you're trying to achieve there and valuations, I would suspect a more reasonable and that's based into lot of the other competitors that have had struggles in that area over the past couple years as well. Inge Thulin : Well, I think all five business group can benefit from actions in this area and it's an ongoing portfolio management activities that we are working on. So I will not call out, one business group over another one relative to, how we can build strings on strings in those business groups because when you look upon our strength in each of the five business group, it is very strong. So I think in each and individual business group that will add value by us working on the portfolio management as we are doing at the time. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. David Meline : I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. Thanks for listening. Thanks for your attention to 3M. Have a great day. Good bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 24, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you, good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 business review. I've a few brief announcements before we begin today\u2019s business discussion. We will hold our next investor meeting on Tuesday, December 16 at the Grant Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Please hold 8 AM to noon on your calendars. Also make note of our upcoming earnings call dates scheduled for Thursday, October 23 of this year and Thursday, January 29 and Thursday, April 23 of 2015. Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations Web site at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now please turn to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 3M performed strong in the second quarter, once again posting organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team delivered record sales and rising margins and did so while continuing to build for the future. Let me take you through a few highlights for the quarter. Earnings were $1.91 per share, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales rose to $8.1 billion, which marks the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. Organic local currency sales growth was 4.8%, lead by electronics and energy at 6%. Health care, industrial, and safety and graphics, each grew 5%, and consumer grew 4%. Geographic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific at 7%. Europe Middle East Africa and United States both grew 5% followed by Latin America Canada at 3%. Premium margins remain a hallmark for 3M. In the second quarter margins rose to nearly 23%, up 80 basis points from last year. I am pleased that all five business groups delivered margins greater than 20% demonstrating the breadth of our strength. As you know, we are managing toward a better optimized capital structure. This will enable us to invest more in the business and return more cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned 2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as you see on slide four, last week we announced our plan to acquire the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at the price of $885 million. This business is a leader in many of our industrial divisions plus electronics and energy. In addition, we see significant opportunities in Japan\u2019s addressable markets for healthcare, safety and graphics and consumer businesses. Upon closing of the deal, 3M will have full control of one of our largest and more successful subsidiaries. We look forward to growing this business even further in the future. Now please turn to slide five. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. We continue to expect earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic sales growth of plus 3 to plus 6%. Currency impact should reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, and we still estimate the tax rate of 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%. I'd like to mention a few other notable things from the second quarter. In April, 3M earned United States Environment Protection Agency\u2019s Energy Star Award for the 10th consecutive year. No other industrial company has been so recognized by the EPA. Research and development is the heartbeat of our company. And in May, we were pleased to receive our 100,000 patent. And last month, we appointed Nick Gangestad, as our Chief Financial Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank David Meline for his contribution over six years including three years as CFO which followed three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Nick now became CFO also after serving three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Previously, Nick held key leadership positions in multiple business groups around the world and he's well prepared for this his new role. He is a 27-year veteran of 3M and I've personally known and worked with Nick for the last 10 of those years. He has worked directly with me on executing our financial and operational strategies and I am happy to have him as our CFO.  And by that, I\u2019ll give the call over to Nick. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Let me just say that I am excited to lead 3M\u2019s finance team and to help the 3M leadership team create even greater value going forward. And to those of you on the line that I have yet to meet, I certainly look forward to meeting you in the future. Now, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll take you through our income statement. The Company operated well in the second quarter with sales exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history, compared to last year sales were up 5%, operating income up 9%, and earnings per share up 12%. Productivity was particularly strong this quarter, which helped fueled more investment in SG&A and R&D as we continue building for the future. And at the same time, we expanded operating margins by nearly 1 point. I'll go into a little more detail on the margin change. Leverage on organic volume added 30 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 1.2% each points year-on-year. Selling prices continue to be supported by technology innovation, which is a key fundamental strength of the Company and helps drive unique customer solutions and an increasing flow of new products. We also began raising prices in mid-2013 to help offset currency weakness in select developing countries. This will result in our price performance moderating in the second half of the year beginning in Q3.  And on the raw material front, we are benefiting from lower market prices and from our sourcing teams' efforts to reduce cost even further. Reduced pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to second quarter margins. Strategic investments this quarter reduced margins year-on-year by 40 basis points. This included increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP cost, and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts excluding the positive price recovery I just mentioned reduced margins by 60 basis points. All in all second quarter earnings increased 12% to a $1.91 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 per share and the higher tax rate reduced earnings by another $0.05 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.09 to second quarter earnings per share. All things considered, this was a good quarter for the Company. Slide 7 outlines the details of our second quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 4.8% with volumes up 3.5% and selling prices up 1.3%. Our businesses have done a good job of executing under growth plans. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to sales growth and foreign exchange had no impact on the second quarter worldwide sales. On a total U.S. dollar basis sales rose 4.9% versus the second quarter of 2013. As was the case in the first quarter, Organic sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas. Asia-Pacific organic growth was 6.6%. Organic growth was again broad-based with all five business groups growing led by our electronics and energy and consumer businesses. Organic growth was 7% in Japan or 2% ex-electronics. China, Hong Kong, grew 6% organically in Q2 with or 10% excluding electronics, which was an improvement versus the first quarter\u2019s underlying growth rate. Organic growth in EMEA was 4.8% in the second quarter. West Europe grew 3.5%, Central/East Europe grew high single-digits and Middle East/Africa grew at a double digit pace. EMEA\u2019s growth was strongest in safety and graphics, electronics and energy and industrial. Our teams in EMEA are executing well in 2014.  In the United States second quarter organic local currency growth was 4.5%, up from Q1 and led by healthcare and safety and graphics.  Finally, Latin America/Canada grew 2.7% organically with electronics and energy and healthcare leading the way. Mexico generated double-digit organic growth and Brazil was down slightly. Organic local currency growth was 7% across all developing markets and 4% in developed markets.  Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, turn to slide number 8. Looking at first half 2014 results, free cash flow was 2.1 billion or 143 million above 2013 levels. Operating cash flow was up 59 million and capital expenditures were 84 million lower versus the prior year. We expect the full year CapEx to be approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion in 2014, down slightly versus a previous expectation of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We are encouraged to see that our portfolio management efforts are providing greater clarity regarding business unit priorities and their related CapEx needs. Improved plant productivity is also freeing up capacity as we continue to improve our plant efficiency and add lean capability over time. Through the first six months of 2014, we converted 85% of net income to free cash flow versus 84% in the first half of 2013. We continue to expect full year conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%. At our 2013 December Investor Meeting, we articulated plans to manage toward a better optimized capital structure going forward and to allocate capital accordingly. The plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage which we'll use for two purposes. First, to invest in order to expand and improve our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing this plan in 2014, evidenced in-part by last week\u2019s announcement that we will acquire the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo 3M which Inge covered earlier. We will finance this deal with non-U.S. cash and we expect it to close in the third quarter. We also paid 1.1 billion in cash dividends in the first six months of 2014, up 246 million year-on-year. Gross share repurchases were 3.1 billion during that same period. For full year 2014, we expect gross share repurchases will be in the range of 4.5 billion to 5 billion versus a previous expectation of 4 billion to 5 billion. Net debt at the end of June was 2.8 billion, up 1.5 billion versus year-end 2013. During the second quarter, 3M issued 625 million of five year debt at a cue point of (1 and 5/8%) [ph] and 325 million of 30 year debt at a cue point of (3 and 7/8%) [ph]. Next I will go through the results for each of our business groups, starting with industrial, please go to slide number 9. Our industrial business continues to perform nicely with second quarter sales of 2.8 billion and 5% organic local currency growth. Our 3M purification business again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter and we also posted nice growth in automotive OEM, aerospace and commercial, transportation, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in both the U.S. and EMEA. Latin America/Canada was down slightly in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was 670 million. Operating margins were 21.9%. Recall that each our business groups is absorbing incremental investment in 2014 related to business transformation and ERP implementation. This had the effect of reducing Q2 margins for each of our five businesses by 30 basis points.  Let\u2019s now look at Safety and Graphics, found on slide 10. You will see that Safety and Graphics sales were 1.5 billion in the quarter with organic growth of 5%. Personal safety is a heartland division in 3M and one of our largest in terms of sales. It was once again the fastest growing business within Safety and Graphics posting high single digit organic growth in Q2. We also saw positive growth in Commercial Solutions and in Traffics, Safety and Security systems. Sales in our roofing granules business declined versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas led by EMEA at 7% and U.S. at 5%. Operating income was 353 million in the second quarter and operating margins were a solid 23.6%. Please go to Slide 11. Electronics and Energy also turned in a good second quarter performance. Sales were 1.4 billion, up 6% in organic local currency terms. Our electronics related businesses posted organic local currency growth of 11%. Growth was strong in both display materials and systems and in electronics materials and solutions. In our energy related businesses, sales increased 1% organically. Second quarter organic local currency growth was 9% in Latin America, Canada; 8% in Asia-Pacific; and 6% in EMEA. The U.S. was flat year-on-year. Operating income rose 23% to 293 million and operating margins were 20.6%. Next, I will take you through Healthcare found on Slide 12. Building on a strong first quarter performance, our healthcare business once again delivered strong growth and profitability. Second quarter sales were just over 1.4 billion. Organic local currency sales growth was 5% and margins were strong at 30.7%. All businesses contributed to healthcare\u2019s growth in the second quarter. Health information systems, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention led the way. In April, we also further strengthened our health information systems business by acquiring Treo Solutions, a leader in using data analytics, to redesign payments structures and help transition healthcare providers to value based care models. Integration efforts are running ahead of expectations. Healthcare\u2019s organic sales grew in all geographic areas paced by Latin America, Canada, and Asia-Pacific at 7%, the U.S. at 6% and EMEA at 3%. Operating income was 434 million and again operating margins were 30.7% adjusting for Treo operating margins were 31.1%. I\u2019ll wrap up with the consumer business group found on Slide number 13. Sales in the consumer business group were 1.1 billion with organic local currency growth of 4%. Our construction in home improvement business delivered strong double organic growth in the second quarter and we also posted positive growth in our consumer, healthcare and home care businesses. Stationary and office supply sales were basically flat year-on-year. Second quarter organic growth across consumer was 4% in the U.S. which was up from Q1. Back to school activity began in late Q2 so we\u2019re off to a good start there. Elsewhere, consumers\u2019 organic growth was 8% in Asia-Pacific and 4% in EMEA. In Latin America/Canada, sales were down slightly in organic local currency terms. Operating income was 241 million with operating margins of 21.1%. That wraps up my review and I will turn it back to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. As you can see, there is a lot to like this quarter across the entire company. In industrial for example automotive volumes grew four times the rate of global (automobiles) [ph]. And in 3M purification formally known as CUNO, organic growth was 13% and we see this business accelerating in many areas of the world. I am encouraged by the growth in consumer of the modest first quarter which includes a nice improvement in the United States. Our home improvement division together with consumer healthcare and homecare all showed good growth. Our safety and graphic business performed well. Personal safety for example grew 9% globally including more than 25% in China. In healthcare, we continue to expand worldwide with 12% growth in developing markets this quarter. I am pleased that all healthcare businesses grew on a global basis. Finally in electronics and energy, our portfolio management actions continue to payoff. Over the past couple of years, we have consolidated several divisions to better align with customers and improved our competitiveness. Those actions along with strong volumes drove margins higher in the second quarter. Through six months, margins were 19% and we expect the full year to trend towards 20%. So overall I want to thank our entire 3M team for delivering another strong broad based performance. And going forward we will continue to gain even more value through our three strategic levels; portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation. Those levels are helping us deliver solid results today while also building a stronger foundation for long term success. Thank you for your attention. And with that we now welcome your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis - Barclays Bank : Not much to pick on in the quarter it was solid overall. But one thing that wasn\u2019t clear in the slides at least on Slide 9 industrial was -- margins were down 60 bps -- 30 bps of it but I would have thought with organic growth of about 5% you would have some operating leverage on that. So maybe just some clarification on why those margins were down. Inge Thulin : Hi Scott, this is Inge. When you think about our business group in industrial that\u2019s the biggest business group for us and also the business group that we are historically and still today entering first when we go into new markets based on the size and scale and so forth and that\u2019s the way we have talked about how we build out businesses from infrastructure, industrial, safety, consumer and healthcare, as the economies evolve. So if you think about that business on a global scale the way we operate it, that\u2019s like 32% of total company. When you go to developing economies, it\u2019s slightly more, it\u2019s 35%-36% and then you go to emerging market which is closer I would say to 45%. So when we looked upon it and yes as you said -- so why was this happening. The real reason there is actually they have a bigger slowdown in the emerging market in the developing world. So I am not concerned at all about it, in fact when I looked upon industrial in terms of the growth which is the important element, we saw 5% growth in United States, we saw 5% in Europe Middle East Africa and we saw 11% in China. So when I looked upon it overall I am pleased with industrial but the reason is the 30 basis point as you call out and then as that portfolio in that type of emerging market as we all know at the moment there is some small turbulence I would say if you think about Central East Europe we have a little bit of the impact in Latin America, et cetera, that\u2019s the reason. But I am not concerned and I don\u2019t think you should be concerned either. We have a very good team there that are running those businesses very well. And so automotive very good, purification again a fantastic quarter, so all core businesses are doing well there. Scott Davis - Barclays Bank : Okay, that helps a lot. And Inge just because you referenced macro, I mean, I think we\u2019ve had 15 companies report so far this quarter. And I can\u2019t tell whether the world to getting better or the world to getting worse. What is your view on global macro, maybe by region? Inge Thulin : Yes, well, first of all, there is the macro picture and then how we expect to perform in that world, if you think. So, first of all, I will say, in West Europe, if you think about us, we guided a year from flat to 3% and we came out first quarter with three, actually this quarter more or less the same and we still think that that will be the range for us for the year. So, that\u2019s a little bit on the positive side for us in terms of our execution. In Asia, we saw a slight improvement in China, or what I would call base business and for me, then base business, yes, so we talk the same languages if I take out electronics because that is moving around in Asia in between countries. Our base business in China consecutive went from 8% to 10%, and has a big improvement versus a year ago. And our Japanese business in fact in total grew 7%. And if you, again, look upon the base, that was 2%. So I will say Asia is going sideways slightly up; West Europe as we expected, United States, small strength; and we had a better second quarter than first. And as you recall I said at that time, I am not concerned about U.S., because I had a feeling it will come back in the second and that was correct. I think the place where we see a little bit of modest challenge is Latin America where we said before for the year 8 to 11 and we think now may be mid digit for the year. So, slightly down but it\u2019s offset for us by other regions of the world. So, I think that\u2019s what we are saying still 3 to 6, so I will say that I don\u2019t see much of a movement versus what we have talked about earlier. Latin America slightly slower, West Europe slightly better, U.S. slightly better and also big geographical areas, so that will compensate more what you can see as I will identify as a temporarily slowdown in Latin America. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Good morning. Inge, very strong results in electronics and energy, can you give us a little more color on the margin expansion you've had in the first half and I guess a little bit more margin expansion in the back half to get to the [indiscernible] you are guiding to? Inge Thulin : Yes, first of all as you recall we looked upon our portfolio, it\u2019s almost two years ago now and we consolidated many businesses that was related to electronic and energy in the company that in some cases we had in different components of the company. So, we streamlined organization and consolidate in order for us to be faster to market and be able to respond to the customer need. So, we did that and we combined the division and the outcome of that is that we got a lower infrastructure to work with. We have got better utilization of assets and we are faster to respond to markets and we have moved, I will say from in some cases product sales to more system sales which is now paying off. So, I think we had 11% growth in electronics and a lot of that is coming to the new approach with this display material system division that is now selling components into solution for the electronic market.  So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of efficiency into organization, better utilization in manufacturing and then we had the volume upticks that came direct on based on the work we're doing with the customer. So, if you think about where we have taken that business for the last 18 months or so from 15 to 17 and actually this quarter we did over 20. But the plan is to go towards 20 and that\u2019s where we are for the year. I think the plan is 19 plus and I think that\u2019s where it will end up for the remainder of the year and certainly will be a good year for that group. And they have really responded well to our portfolio management initiatives. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Very good and impressive. And one more thing, Inge just in safety this double-digit growth you've seen in personal protection, how sustainable is that growth in the back half of the year? Inge Thulin : Well, we have a very strong position in that business historically. It\u2019s a fantastic platform for us and is very global in scope and we are, I will say the leader in that whole space relative to respiratory protection. It\u2019s sustainable and I think the trends are positive for us and if you think about some parts of the world where it's very strong regulations like United States and West Europe and so forth and we're doing well there. And then you have I will say developing economies and I will put China into developing economies. So, if you think about China in terms of mega trends in China that\u2019s -- its air pollution, its water and its food safety. When air pollution is playing very well to our very strong position in this business, so when you see 9% growth for quarter, 25 plus in China, this is sustainable as a business on a global space. And one of the reasoning, we have scale and we have a very professional team in place and it\u2019s a regulatory business, so it\u2019s good for us, generally speaking -- regulated business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein : Inge, just a quick question or Nick, on the Sumitomo impact, you said it\u2019s closing September 1st, you've got a 12 month, $0.08 impact, you are not changing guidance. So that first four months which I guess I would have assumed would be more cost and benefit, you're just making up for that elsewhere. How should be think about the dilutive or accretive impact before the end of this year? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve, this is Nick. You are correct, we said that\u2019s approximately an $0.08 benefit over the 12 months and we are expecting this to close on September 1. At this point, we felt it was premature to up our -- change our guidance at this point we\u2019re halfway through the year, everything's going right down the middle of what we\u2019re expecting. And just as this is a slight upside to our original expectation we have other things that are on a slight negative, for example, FX impact. We started the year thinking that would be flat to hurting us by $0.05 we\u2019re now in the $0.07-$0.08 range of impact. So, all in all, we think everything is staying very close to our original guidance. Matt Ginter : Steve, maybe one, Steve, this is Matt maybe one follow up. The transaction should not have a lot of cost associated with it from an integration standpoint. But third quarter we expect really de minims impact on earnings and assuming we close on September 1st as expected we\u2019d expect some slight accretion and you could think about it on a straight line basis using that $0.08 as a guide. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Fantastic, that\u2019s very helpful. The other point is on CapEx, that roughly $200 million lower guide in last quarter and you called out some of the lean and other impacts that you\u2019re having. But this is a strike me as a really potentially massive shift in terms of what you\u2019re getting out of this. Can you maybe talk also, are there any things that you\u2019re deferring what you aren\u2019t doing even year-on-year it\u2019s lower now. And should we kind of rethink our business model on CapEx side for 3M going forward based on what you\u2019re getting as indicated here or am I making too big a deal out of it? Nick Gangestad : : Steve I appreciate the question. Our business model, over a longer period of time as we invest between 4.5% and 5% of revenue in CapEx, and we started the year with an estimate on the high end of that range. As we\u2019ve gone through the year and we\u2019re seeing those benefits which I talked about earlier, we\u2019re seeing an opportunity that we don\u2019t need some of the capital that we started out the year anticipating we may need. There is really I would say Steve, to your question should we change the modeling going forward, no. We\u2019re basically in that 4.5% to 5% range and we expect to stay there. As temporary what we\u2019re seeing of the benefits this year and really reflects great results that the team is doing so far this year. Inge Thulin : We don\u2019t hold back on any investment relative to our growth, so there we continue them as we have laid out. But again for me this is a positive sign relative to the operation here in terms of in some cases better utilization around the world. And if you think about our strategies, the fourth strategy that as we laid out where we talk about intensified capabilities to achieve regional sales sufficiency, I think we\u2019ve been able to start to move in that direction. But it\u2019s too early to change the model by definition but I think as this year, this is what it look for us and then we think is the right time now, we have to correct that for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just want to follow up on Steve\u2019s question, just thinking about energy and electronics, I know this was a big focus for the team in terms of improving efficiency of this business. You guys have eluded sourcing initiatives, you have eluded planned productivity initiatives. Do you care to quantify the impact of those and when, if not now, when do you think we will hear about sort of more discrete items there? David Meline : Andrew, in terms of productivity, we have, in the past, we\u2019ve shared in our margin walk how we see productivity impacting, or positively or negatively, our results. If you think back to a year ago, we were showing with utilization a negative impact on our financial results. This quarter we\u2019re not showing that, year on year we\u2019re seeing a benefit by that lack of headwind. And in measuring productivity in our plants something that was slightly negative in 2013 has turned slightly positive for us in the first half of this year. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But it just seems a sort of a broader initiative than just quarter over quarter change. But I guess we can take that offline. The other question though on the CapEx question, you did have CapEx yet you left your cash realization target intact. So, is there extra cash consumption on the working capital side or you're just being conservative right now? Inge Thulin : I think we just would like to keep the flexibility as we go here. So the way I think about it and we think about, we\u2019re like six months into the year and we would like to keep the flexibility as we go. There is just two more quarters and we were able hopefully to talk more about it on the next quarter as we move ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Nicky, you mentioned the (expectation) [ph] of pricing would start to [indiscernible], what about the other side of the equation, raw materials, it looks like raw materials are pretty flat year-over-year in 2Q, I am just wondering what you see in terms trends in some of your key raw materials? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, on the raw material front, we\u2019ve been seeing our raw material prices in aggregate drop between 1.5% and 2%. We saw that in the first two quarters of the year. We expect that to continue and if you think back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we expect the raw materials to benefit us by $0.05 to $0.15 for the year. We still see ourselves in that range probably tracking closer to the high end in that range. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, so is the raw material still down year-over-year in the second of the half of the year? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay and then secondly on the ERP, just wondered if you could maybe just talk about where [indiscernible] plan on the rollout for this year. I know that the early phases resulted in lower corporate as you work in cost more to the segments. I know the corporate was a little bit lower year-over-year. I am wondering is the EPR continuing to have that impact particularly in corporate segments. Inge Thulin : : Yes, we on plan relative to the rollout. We have talked about earlier. I have rolled out now in five countries around the world. We have in addition to that rolled out four distribution centers in West Europe or Central East Europe, so we have done one in UK, we have done one in France. We have done one in Poland. And yes, beginning of this month, we rollout the biggest one which is in (J\u00fcchen) [ph] in Germany, our biggest distribution center in West Europe. And I was in fact myself over there, yes, the week before and then follow-up slightly after that and walked the floors relative to make sure with the team that we were prepared for that to cutover and I am very pleased to say, it\u2019s going very well relative to that execution.  So, I will say that even as you know when you make those moves right, you always learn a little bit on every place and we have and I will say, we, yes, take those learnings and we step up our mitigations and the team in place in order to be more effective as we implement as we go ahead.  But in terms of the financials you see then in terms of cost, it\u2019s still accurate, there is no change to that and I will say that as we move ahead probably we will like to make sure we maybe can accelerate some of the implementation in places where we can get even better financial benefits. So maybe not changed a figure in terms of [indiscernible] but see if we can capture something earlier and get more focus around it. But so far so good, but again as you know there is always a little bit of a change management as you do those type of things right, but I think the important thing, the prime metric for us is customer satisfaction. Nick Gangestad : And Nigel to add, this is Nick. I want to add one point on that. The 30 basis point increase in spending that we\u2019re seeing in our five businesses are from spending that we are now putting into the businesses to do this and this is not a shift between corporate miscellaneous and the businesses. If you\u2019re looking at the corporate miscellaneous piece, the year-on-year change there is really driven by a reduction in our pension expense largely as we had laid out at the beginning of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - Citi Research : I was hoping to get some more color regarding the growth investments. You said it was a 40 basis point hit that\u2019s broadly across 3M, but how does that impact the individual segments and what kind of return are you expecting on both the pure new products but as well as the restructurings? Nick Gangestad : : Well, Deane, our strategic investments come in -- there is multiple categories there, one is our invest in innovation as you\u2019re alluding to, and that is still an investment mode where we\u2019re working to develop those new technologies for the future and we\u2019re not expecting an accretive benefit to growth from those investments in 2014 and little in 2015.  For the rest of our strategic investment that we\u2019ve talked about, part of that is restructuring and part of that is our incremental investment in business transformation and ERP. Those are tracking approximately where we\u2019ve expected on the restructuring front where about halfway through the year and where we\u2019ve spent about half of what we expect to spend for the year on restructuring. Benefits in the last half of the year, we still see in low single-digit millions of dollars, we expect more benefit from that into the tens of millions of dollars in 2015. Deane Dray - Citi Research :  And for Inge, what\u2019s interesting at the very end of your prepared remarks you cited some upside in the business, the Cuno filtration business. There was a big multiple paid in that business a while ago but it looks like it\u2019s beginning to deliver the way you all had envisioned it. So, what is that longer opportunity for Cuno in the portfolio, when you've hinted in the past you might be interested in doing some water investments and how do you see that opportunity? Inge Thulin :  Well, I think first of all that what we call now purification right is a business that during the last couple of years really improved for us, so let\u2019s put out a little bit of perspective, you talk about when we purchased that the multiple was high and so forth, right. I think initially when that was purchased, we didn\u2019t integrated fast enough into 3M, so if you think about what we are looking for as fundamental growth drivers for every business is around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands. Those are the things that we need to capture when we purchase something. I think in that case we hold and that\u2019s now many years ago but I think we hold it aside too long before we really start to drive the value that 3M will add in those four categories. The last three years that have now taken place and they have done a fantastic job in my mind relative to efficiency and operational excellence, consolidation of manufacturing start to lay in some of the technologies that can help them and then start to use the global capabilities in terms of our footprint. That\u2019s why you now see quarter-on-quarter sequential good growth, there were 13% this quarter was very similar first quarter of this year and in many market we see huge opportunities as we go ahead based on our current portfolio. It\u2019s always difficult to give you a figure as you look upon it but again I go back and say that it\u2019s clear that clean water and clear air is a very important element in most parts of the world and specifically I will say in developing world. And that\u2019s also where we see a fantastic growth rate for this business, so this is a very good space for us and I am very pleased where we stand today with that business and we will continue to invest as we go ahead for more growth and also efficiency into organization. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies :  Good morning. Two quick questions, your Greater China business, how fast is that growing now and in the comment about the energy related businesses growing only about 1% and telecom being the leading part of that, can you talk about how weak the rest of that business was and were there any other end markets that had decelerated in the quarter? Inge Thulin :  Well let\u2019s start with what we call China, Hong Kong in terms of that operation. We had in this quarter we moved from Q1, 8% growth to 10% growth in the quarter for China and if you compare that on that base business that was only 1% Q2 last year. So, year-over-year good improvement and over last quarter also slight improvement, so that\u2019s moving forward positively and again you see in businesses there that you take industrial was 13% growth in the quarter, healthcare was 17%, consumer and office 20% and you have safety and graphics just over 10%. So, it\u2019s moving ahead very well and I think we are past the time where China was a 25% growth for the quarter but we are running that now at 10% with slight uptick, so that\u2019s good and we feel good about where we stand today in China. Relative to the energy piece, there is some tender business going on in that business and that can hit us a little bit short, you saw telecom had 4% growth and then some of the other businesses was down but it was not much big figures on the downside. And there is some, I will say tenders that is going because some it is government related and utility related, so it can move a little bit in between quarters but nothing to be really concerned about. And we have one of our Heartland divisions is part of that, so it was not much down, just a little bit. We're very pleased that telecom grew 4% that was a good figure for us. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : : : a: Nick Gangestad : : Yes Jeff, on the cash flow and the working capital managing our inventory continues to be one of our important priorities and improving our inventory churns making some progress there we expect more progress on that in the coming quarters. Specifically to your question about business transformation ERP and the impact that could be having over the long term we are convinced that where we\u2019re going with business transformation and ERP that we have significant opportunities to improve our working capital and in particular inventory management and generate benefits there. In the short term in particular in the second quarter with some of our go live activity we had there was minimal I\u2019ll call it in the $10 million to $30 million increased inventory in some of the channel in anticipations of go live activity. Inge Thulin :   But if Jeff your question was the longer term, it was a little hard to tell on our end. We have talked about a longer term opportunity in working capital but it\u2019s that bigger win is not something we\u2019d expect in the next year or two necessarily. We\u2019ve sized that above 500 million. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Okay, thank you for the clarification there. And I am just wondering on share repurchase, kind of is there -- we obviously can do the math on the share price and figure out what a dollar buys these days, but is there any additional pressure on just kind of other dilutive effects, options exercises or anything else that kind of heats against that gross number? Nick Gangestad :   No, there is nothing out of the ordinary there, Jeff, that\u2019s happening on a dilution basis. We did pick up our activity some in the first half of the year, we saw it as good opportunity and on the dilution front very-very similar to trends to what we\u2019ve seen in the last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Thank you. Good morning. Just maybe on energy, so the work you\u2019re doing on consolidating the divisions I guess showing in the margins here. So the question is, is this improvement, is this a couple of quarter phenomena or do you think this could be -- there could be runway for couple of years here and the business has been below company margins. So do you think there is opportunity to take margins up to more near the company average levels? Inge Thulin : Well think about it in this way, we are running around 22% to 23% margin as an enterprise. We have some businesses that is running in the middle of that and you have two that is type of one is higher which is healthcare and then you have electronic and energy that is lower. And as you recall when we started the journey this was around 15 plus, that industry by definition that\u2019s a good margin in that industry by definition and that will always be a differentiation. So I will say that this move from 15% closer to 20% over this period of time was our expectation. If it will go more up in the area of 25% to 30% I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic for that market in order for us to do that. But I think any business in 3M our expectation is that you should be close to the average out the company. And our organization there today is more streamlined and I think we are better prepared also to deal with some eventual volatility in that market on the electronic side that we know will come from time to time, that\u2019s part of that business and we train that business so that\u2019s okay. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Good, that\u2019s helpful. And then Treo, could you maybe provide some color on the margin profile there? And then how should we think about the trajectory and the impact on segment margins, as it kind of integrate that business? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all, that\u2019s an integration into our healthcare -- health information system, so that business have been growing, the health information system have been growing very well for us the last five to 10 years. And you should think about it in terms of that this acquisition is actually an addition in order for us to get more relevance into different parts of the segment.  So health information system today is a growing business and we are doing that for providers in coding, grouping and analytics. And that\u2019s to the hospital providers. Now we will get access to vast set of payers that then they can help to connect the two of them. So as the model is moving from volume base to quality outcome this is what will help, so I will look upon it as an integrated part of the current business we have and it\u2019s a relatively small business as you know. So, it\u2019s more for us to be able to get access and connect the two entities together. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, my first question is just on price cost, clearly another good quarter above 100 basis points but looks like last time FX was a benefit. Can you just quantify the tailwind that you got in the quarter from FX on the price cost basis? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Joe thanks for that question, for the quarter on the top-line we really saw no impact from FX, everything netted out to nothing. What we're seeing is a negative impact on our margin this year, year-on-year is a fact that we had significant hedging gains a year ago as part of our strategy and the lack of those gains is causing that margin year-on-year erosion, margin erosion, really has nothing to do with 2014. It has to do with the gain we took last year on our hedging. Matt Ginter : Joe, as part of your question, how much price we have gotten due to currency? Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Yes, that\u2019s right, Matt. Nick Gangestad : As we've said last quarter about half of our price we really see as currency related and we think that will be running its course soon. We instituted a lot of price increases related to currency in the middle of last year and so that\u2019s the primary driver why we're saying we expect that price growth to moderate in the last half of 2014. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Nick and one follow-up may be for Inge. Inge you mentioned that you brought down your growth expectations for LatAm. It looks like you had negative volume growth in the quarter and so may be if you could just provide some positives and may be areas of weaknesses that you are seeing in a region today? Inge Thulin : Yes, Latin America, first of all we have probably the best portfolio mix in that part of the world, and so we feel very good relative to our overall platform as we move ahead and as you know we have been doing business in Latin America since I think 1946 was when we started in Brazil. When you look upon it now, there was a little bit of temper specifically in Brazil I will say, Brazil was flat to down, Mexico was up 12%. So, I would say Brazil had an impact for different reasons and then for us at least what we are selling personal safety into the mining was also on the lower end. So, I think that Brazil was for us the downturn this quarter specifically and then Canada was flat. You have Latin America/Canada together, Canada flat, Brazil down, most other up and Mexico up 12%. But as I said this is a part of the world that is the most developed of our developing regions and we know how to do business there. So, step up for me always when I look upon Latin America over the years and I follow that as I led international for eight years before I came into this job. We have a constant growth over time in Latin America but that could be a little bit of dip in a quarter but that\u2019s not the overall concern for us. We are just short term stay the course and capitalize on the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan : Good morning. Just on the price cost thing on the deflation I guess on your raw materials. How much of that, I guess you said to 100 to 150 basis points for the first half, how much was it precisely in the second quarter and then how much of that do you think is blocking and tackling and kind of structural like every year you can kind of bang out certain amount of that, it just seem to be kind of a nice tailwind for a while now? Nick Gangestad : I appreciate that question because it gives me a chance to make it clear here that the benefits we see on raw materials are not just a passive benefit that 3M gets by being in the market. There are some benefits we get thanks to the market but a lot of this, Steve, is driven by what our sourcing team is doing in 3M to bring about those benefits. So, of that total 1.2%, 1.3% benefit that we're seeing in the second quarter, there is a portion of that that\u2019s raw materials probably a little less than half of that that\u2019s raw material driven. And that raw material portion is made up of several components. One is just outright market conditions where we're enjoying that benefit. Second is what we're doing from a 3M perspective to drive those benefits and use our power in the market to benefit there and then the third is, there is a portion of that that involves us substituting one raw material for another to 3M's advantage. So it\u2019s a broad perspective of what\u2019s driving that number, Steve. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: So I guess out of the 1.2 to 1.3 how much is just maybe to narrow it down, how much is it market exposure related half like 25% of that or? Nick Gangestad : : I think it\u2019s around half, Steve, as we looked at the raw material deflation this quarter. Yes, you could think of it and it varies a little bit from period to period, but it\u2019s about half market and half due to the additional value we can add. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: That\u2019s very helpful and then one just quick follow-up on electronics. The cycles have been kind of notoriously tough to predict in, I am not sure if there is a good way to forecast this, but how do you feel about the growth there in the second half, I mean sequentially it was definitely stronger than we were expecting it up high single digits, should we think about normal seasonality in the back half of the year and what's your sense of kind of inventory the customer decision again? Nick Gangestad : : You start on the inventory side. We don\u2019t see any build up in the channel so I think that it\u2019s at a normal level as in the past. So if we start there based on your last point of your question, otherwise I will say look it like you can think about it in normal way all the season, but also for us we work with all suppliers in that industry. And it will all be dependent on the end market demand in the end, so for us definitely will be the growth driver or less growth driver as we move head. But I don\u2019t think there is any change for us at this point in time relative to the outlook for the growth of electronics and energy in that business. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, guys, one last quick one just on the -- you have an easier comp in the third quarter, tougher comp in the fourth quarter on growth or I think maybe other way around, but anything than the comps that moves around as far as stability of growth rates in the second half? Nick Gangestad : : Are you talking electronics or total companies? Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: No, just total 3M organic, looks like the midpoint averages around 4% growth that maybe conservative or not, but should one quarter be better than the other because of the comparisons? Nick Gangestad : : No, I think -- you can think about it in the following way. If you go back to 2013, first half we had 2% organic local currency growth. Second part, we had 4%. First part of this year, we are close to 5. And I think you should think about this we move ahead for the year that based on the range we\u2019re giving is 3 to 6, so I think it would be very much in that range for the last quarter. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. Matt Ginter : : I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your engagement and interest in 3M. We look forward to talking you soon. Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 23, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 business review. You\u2019ll see a list of upcoming events and dates on Slide 2. We will hold our next investor meeting on Tuesday, December 16th at the Grant Hyatt Hotel in New York City. The meeting will begin at 8 am and conclude around noon. Invitations will be sent today, so please RSVP as soon as possible. Also, make note of our earnings call dates for 2015, scheduled for January 27th, April 23rd, July 23rd and October 22nd. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. If you please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand off to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. The third quarter for 3M was marked by steady execution and strong growth delivered in a mixed global economic environment. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth in all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team\u2019s execution also produced raising margins and the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. At the same time, we made investments in research and development and our commercialization capabilities to ensure long term success. Let me take you through a few highlights of the quarter. Earnings rose to $1.98 per share, up 11.2% year-over-year. Sales were $8.1 billion, a 3M record. Organic growth was 4% companywide on top of 6% growth in last year\u2019s third quarter. Leading the way with 5% growth was Healthcare, a business that is pioneering medical advancements in emergency rooms, hospitals and dental clinics around the world. Electronics and Energy grew a solid 4% with particular strength in our electronics business. Industrial also grew 4% with special encouraging growth in the United States. Consumer delivered 3% growth, including significant gains in our do-it-yourself business. Safety and Graphics also grew 3% led by our personal safety division. Organic growth was positive across all geographic areas paced by the United States at 6% and Asia Pacific at 5%. I\u2019m pleased that operating margins are very robust. Margins rose to 23%, up 1.4 percentage points year-on-year. All business groups delivered margins greater than 22%, another company first. Margin expansion combined with 4% organic growth is further evidence our portfolio management actions are delivering hard results. Free cash flow was strong in the third quarter, allowing us to deploy more resources to enhance the values of our businesses. And we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases. On September 1st, 3M also completed acquisition of the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at the price of $865 million. And three weeks ago, I was in Japan to visit our team along with our biggest customers. We discussed the growth opportunities in the market around infrastructure, healthcare, consumer and other areas. Our 3M Japan team is excited to grow into an even bigger and more profitable enterprise. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our third quarter performance. We executed well and delivered strong growth across the company. Nick will now take you through the details. Nick. Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll review the third quarter income statement. Q3 was a strong quarter and we are on track to deliver the sales and income targets that we communicated entering the year. The company continues to operate well with a good balance of growth, margins and cash generation. Third quarter sales were an all-time record, $8.1 billion, an increase of 3% year-on-year with 4% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income rose 9% to $1.9 billion and earnings per share rose 11% year-on-year. We generated good productivity in Q3 and increased operating margins by 1.4 percentage points while investing in important programs for the future. I\u2019ll dig a bit deeper into the components of the third quarter margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to third quarter operating margins. And the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 80 basis points year-on-year. Underlying selling prices remained firm across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year\u2019s comparable quarter. Commodity prices remained steady and our sourcing teams continue to create new opportunities to reduce cost across the globe. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to third quarter margins. Strategic investments reduced third quarter margins by 40 basis points. This includes increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive to third quarter margins as we integrate that business. Inge also mentioned that we acquired the remaining 25% minority equity position in Sumitomo 3M on September 1st. But because that subsidiary was already being fully consolidated in our results, it had no impact on operating margins. It was, however, $0.01 accretive to earnings per share in the third quarter. Finally, productivity and other items added an additional 50 basis points to margin year-on-year. Earnings were $1.98 per share, an increase of 11%. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.02 a share in Q3, given the broad based strength of the U.S. dollar and the higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year\u2019s third quarter which added $0.10 to third quarter earnings per share. Slide 6 outlines the details of our third quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.9% with volumes up 3.2% and selling prices up 0.7%. We\u2019ve now achieved 20 consecutive quarters of positive organic sales growth. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to sales growth and the stronger U.S. dollar reduced third quarter sales by 1.2%. On an all-in basis, sales rose 2.8% versus the third quarter of 2013. Organic local currency sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas, making this the sixth consecutive quarter that we have done so. The United States outpaced all geographic regions in the third quarter with organic local currency growth of 6%. U.S. growth was led by Industrial at 8%, Safety and Graphics at 7% and Healthcare at 6%. Asia Pacific organic growth was 4.9% in Q3. Healthcare and Electronics and Energy led the way with growth of 9% and 7% respectively. Organic local currency growth was 7% in Japan or 3% excluding electronics. China, Hong Kong grew 4% organically in Q3 or 3% excluding electronics against a challenging double-digit comp growth in last year\u2019s third quarter. EMEA posted organic local currency growth of 0.8% in the third quarter. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa each grew in the mid single-digits while West Europe declined 0.5%. While we have seen pockets of slowing in some West European countries, our teams there are executing well in the face of some economic headwinds. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in Healthcare, Safety and Graphics and Industrial, but declined in both Electronics and Energy and Consumer. Finally, Latin America/Canada grew 0.4% organically with Healthcare leading the growth. Mexico generated double-digit organic growth and Brazil was up mid single-digits. Venezuela remains challenging but our team is managing through the situation well and the currency risks are under good control. Revenue was down in the third quarter in Venezuela which reduced organic growth across Latin America/Canada by 6 percentage points. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow was strong in Q3 with 103% conversion versus 61% in last year\u2019s comparable quarter. Operating cash flow increased $560 million driven by multiple factors, including higher net income, lower working capital, lower pension contributions and lower cash taxes. Year-to-date is a similar story with 91% free cash flow conversion versus 76% in 2013. We expect full-year conversion will be in the range of 95% to 100%, up from 90% to 100% previously. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which is consistent with our prior view. We continue to manage the company towards a better optimized capital structure. Our plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage which we\u2019ll use for two purposes. One, to expand our businesses and two, to increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing on that plan in 2014 and beyond. For example, as Inge mentioned, on September 1st, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo 3M for approximately $865 million. We have also paid $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends during the first three quarters of 2014, up $365 million versus 2013. And in terms of buybacks, year-to-date growth repurchases were $4.4 billion, up $835 million year-on-year. We now expect full-year 2014 repurchases will be in the range of $5.5 billion to $6 billion versus a previous expected range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Net debt at September month end was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion versus year end 2013 due to both higher debt levels and lower cash balances. Next, I\u2019ll go through the results for each of our business groups starting with the largest business \u2013 Industrial. Please go to Slide #8. We had a good third quarter in Industrial with sales of $2.8 billion and 4.2% organic local currency growth. This strength was broad based as nearly all businesses posted positive organic growth. Our aerospace and commercial transportation business generated double-digit organic local currency growth and we also saw a strong growth in 3M purification, automotive OEM, advanced materials and industrial adhesives and tapes. The United States was by far the fastest growing region of the world for Industrial with 8% organic growth in the quarter. Again, U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in three of our heartland businesses, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes, along with aerospace and commercial transpiration and automotive OEM. Elsewhere around the world, organic local currency growth was 4% in Asia Pacific, 1% in EMEA, while Latin America/Canada declined 1%. Industrial\u2019s organic growth continues to outpace that of worldwide industrial production and it\u2019s clear we are taking share in some key industries. Automotive OEM is a good example where 3M\u2019s 7% organic growth in the third quarter was three times the rate of global automotive builds. Third quarter operating income industrial was $660 million and operating margins were 22.2%, up a full point versus the third quarter of 2013 and in line with recent quarterly trends. Let\u2019s now look at Safety and Graphics found on Slide 9. Third quarter sales in this business were $1.4 billion, up 3% on an organic local currency basis. Organic growth was led by our personal safety business along with traffic safety and security systems. Sales declined organically in roofing granules. As with Industrial, the United States led all the geographic regions with 7% organic local currency sales growth in the quarter. Personal safety products and traffic safety and security systems again led the way. Organic growth was 3% in EMEA, flat in Latin America/Canada and declined 1% in Asia Pacific. Operating income in Safety and Graphics was $340 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 23.5%. Strong operating leverage, along with the benefits from recent portfolio actions helped drive the increase. Please go to Slide 10. Our Electronics and Energy business continue to post solid results in the third quarter. Sales were $1.5 billion and organic local currency growth was 4%. Operating income was $338 million and margins rose 1.8 percentage points to 22.5%. Organic local currency sales grew 8% on the electronics side of the business due to solid end customer demand combined with successful spec in [ph] wins at several OEMS. In energy, organic local currency sales declined 2% in the third quarter. The electrical markets business was flat in the quarter while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 7% in Asia Pacific, 3% in United States and were up slightly in Latin America/Canada. EMEA declined by 6% in the quarter. We have a strong group of businesses in Electronics and Energy, strengthened further in the past couple of years via multiple actions to better align to our customers and improve the portfolio. The team continues to execute well as evidenced by the growth and margin improvements seen throughout the first nine months of this year. Please turn to Slide 11. Healthcare had another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion, an organic sales growth of 5.4%. Every healthcare business posted positive organic local currency sales growth led by double-digit performances in both drug delivery and health information systems. We also grew organically in all major geographies with Asia Pacific up 9%, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada up 6% and EMEA up 3%. Healthcare\u2019s third quarter organic sales growth was 11% in developing markets, marking the 11th consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve grown at 10% or higher. Developing markets represent substantial opportunities for 3M and we continue to build our capability to capitalize on future opportunities. Third quarter operating income in Healthcare was $432 million and margins were strong at 31%, including some modest dilution from Treo which was acquired on April 1st of this year. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business is exceeding its sales and profit objectives. Last year\u2019s third quarter margin of 32.1% included a 1.4 percentage point benefit from a gain on the sale of a non-strategic asset. If I adjust for this year\u2019s acquisition and last year\u2019s one-time gain, margins increased 70 basis points year-on-year. Healthcare is a strong set of businesses and one of our highest investment priorities. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve made substantial improved investments to bolster our healthcare businesses in China, Germany, Poland, Thailand, India, the United Kingdom and the United States. Last week, we announced a $58 million capacity expansion in the United States to support growing demand for 3M medical tapes, dressings, surgical drapes and other wound care products. I\u2019ll wrap up with the consumer business group found on Slide #12. Third quarter sales in the consumer business group were $1.2 billion with organic local currency growth of 3%. Consumer is home to several of 3M\u2019s best known power brands such as Post-it, Scotch and Scotch-Brite. For the retail consumer, these are household names, but in fact, many other 3M brands are also enjoying success in the marketplace. Take for example our Filtrete brand filters which significantly improve air quality in the home. This business grew double-digits organically in the third quarter as we gained share in the U.S. and expanded the category globally. Our Command brand adhesives also generated double-digit organic growth in the quarter boosted by a strong back-to-college season. College dormitories are a growing market for 3M Command solutions because our products eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items. Filtrete and Command helped propel our do-it-yourself business to 10% organic growth in the third quarter. Sales in the consumer healthcare and homecare businesses also grew organically in Q3 while stationery and office supply was down slightly. Looking at the consumer business geographically, organic local currency growth was 5% in Asia Pacific and 4% in the United States. Back-to-school sales were strong in the U.S. mass retail channel. Consumers organic sales were down slightly in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Operating income was $272 million with operating margins of 23.2%. That wraps up my review of the quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 where I will address our forward outlook. Three quarters in, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We are expecting earnings to be in the range of $7.40 to $7.50 per share versus the prior expected range of $7.30 to $7.55 per share. With respect to organic local currency sales growth, we are narrowing the range to 4% to 5% versus the previous expected range of 3% to 6%. Given recent strength in the U.S. dollar, we are now estimating that foreign currency impacts will reduce sales by approximately 1.5%. Previously, we anticipated a 1% FX headwind. From an earnings perspective, FX for the full-year is now expected to be an approximate $0.15 per share headwind, $0.10 of which has occurred in the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate $0.05 of FX headwind in Q4. Our tax rate estimate is narrowed to 28.5% to 29%. And finally, as I mentioned previously, free cash flow conversion is expected to be between 95% and 100% for the year, up from a prior range of 90% to 100%. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Inge for some additional comments. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, one eye is always on the microscope, driving results day to day, month to month, quarter to quarter. And I remain very pleased with those results. The other eye is on the telescope, ensuring we\u2019re investing for the long term prosperity. Three strategic levers are strengthening our foundation for the future. The first is portfolio management. I mentioned our Japanese acquisition along with portfolio actions in Electronics and Energy. Earlier this year, we also realigned divisions in our Safety and Graphics business group. And on Tuesday, we took action within our Industrial business group. Our personal care division was merged into industrial adhesives and tape division. This will increase customer relevance, create broader research and development and manufacturing capabilities, boost efficiency and position the business for greater success. The second lever is investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It generates unique solutions for customers and raising value for shareholders. That is why research and development is in the center of our plan. We are increasing research and development investment to about 6% of sales by 2017. We\u2019re also funding 26 product platforms specifically aimed to create new sustainable growth to disruptive technologies. I\u2019m very encouraged that we are beginning to see initial product commercialization from some of those programs in healthcare, infrastructure, consumer and other markets. In September, we opened our 46th global customer technical center in the United Kingdom which showcases the breadth of our technology. Those facilities provide an ideal setting for our scientists to meet directly with customers and explore solutions to their unique challenges. This is a very important element as 3M is in the business of inventing things that are both new and useful. These investments are critical to bolstering our competitive edge into the future. The third lever is business transformation. This will allow us to deliver quicker and greater value to customers by creating a more ideal 3M. The backbone is a global ERP system. We are currently live in five countries. Most recently, we also successfully deployed our largest European distribution center in J\u00fcchen, Germany. With each deployment, we are learning more and using those lessons to refine our plans going forward. I remain encouraged by our progress and I will give you a further update on our December 16th investor meeting in New York. To support our ERP system, we are also in the process of creating a standardized global business process. Ultimately, this will leverage 3M\u2019s size and scale to drive productivity and improve service to customers. Those were the three strategic levers propelling our forward fuel. Yet, underpinning each strategy we adapt is the 3M team. Our company has many core strings. Chief among them is our people \u2013 their creativity, their skill and their ability to execute no matter the force of external headwinds. I thank our entire 3M team for delivering a strong third quarter even in a mixed global economic environment. Because of them, we are delivering consistent results today while remaining on track to meet our long term targets. Thank you for your attention. With that, we now welcome all your questions. Operator : (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Inge, the numbers are great obviously and you did mention some macro concerns particularly in Europe. Is there any sense that you see particularly now that you at least have half the month of October through that your customers are starting to get concerned about macros and inventory to your [ph] stocking, any real slowdown or is this volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace maybe a little bit ahead of itself? Inge Thulin : Yes. No, we see what you see and as you\u2019re calling out, you\u2019re talking about Europe a little bit, right? Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes, yes. Inge Thulin : So I think for us in the quarter, as you see on our result for West Europe, we slide down slightly versus Q1 and Q2. That was, I will say, a small temper in Germany relative to the industrial sector. But the consumer and retail piece in that market, meaning the domestic business were still doing okay if you talk about Germany as a country. And the interesting thing in Europe was that there are many countries there that have dragged the performance in West Europe as of the last couple of years like Iberia, Italy, Benelux, in some cases, Alpine. And they show slight growth. So even \u2013 and we saw growth in U.K. as well. So I will say that we saw a slight decline in the industrial piece but it\u2019s not alarming by definition for us. And when we look upon data, when we look upon IPI growth, GDP growth, PMI growth, et cetera, you can see a temper, specifically PMI, that is related to the manufacturing space but is not a concern at all. I will say also when we look upon West Europe in total with a slight decline in growth, if you pool all pieces together, we can in fact pace that down to some utility businesses that are project-based that we had a comparison that was a little bit tougher for us. And that business is coming back next year. So I will say that we got sideline in terms of West Europe if you combine it with total international. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes. And Inge, how about China? I mean, we see good and bad over there. Last time I was there, it seemed like half the businesses were fine, half not fine. But what \u2013 I mean, your business in China, I think about, if my notes are right, has been slowing a bit the last several quarters if I back into it. Are you seeing anything there that causes concern? Inge Thulin : Well, we look upon the same metrics as I talked about for Germany, so IPI, GDP, PMI, et cetera. And when I look upon that for China, it look actually slightly better than the figures I talked about for Germany. So for us, we had a 4% growth in total. If you exclude electronic, it was 7%. So we are mid to high single-digit in our base business. And that is where we have been for the last I will say one to one and a half year. So for me, when I look upon China looking forward, even if they are building out, as we all know, they are building out a domestic business that is good for 3M with our consumer and healthcare business and even if there\u2019s a little bit pressure on the export business, I will say for us we see now us to be in mid to high single-digits. And it\u2019s very consistent for the last couple of quarters. So it\u2019s not \u2013 from that perspective looking forward, it\u2019s not an alarming figure for me. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, very helpful. Well, I\u2019ll pass it on. Congrats, guys, and good luck. Inge Thulin : Thank you very much. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Ram Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi, good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Ram Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Inge, a very, very strong margin quarter obviously, the best I think since 2010. As we go through Q4 and into \u201815 segment wise, where do you see upside or downside to margins? Inge Thulin : We would talk more in December 16 relative to \u201815. And as you can see, we have improved this year very much in Electronics and Energy. That was based on the plan, right? So you recall that business and we go back now a couple of years, we have done a lot in that business in order to improve our performance, both in terms of growth and margins. As you have seen that we constantly have moved them upwards. And we have said for this year that they should come closer to 20, maybe not the whole way to 20 full year, but that is what they will be. And you also know that three of the businesses are basically on corporate average in terms of margin. And then you have Healthcare that is slightly higher I will say. So you will see us be able to continue the work we are doing on our portfolio and so forth. But I don\u2019t know that I can at this point in time call out someone. I think if you look upon it, it\u2019s very robust and broad based now which is good for us. Ram Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Sure, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe one quick follow-up. This move we see in the energy space, does it have any impact that you can see on your energy business or on your raw material side? Nick Gangestad : You\u2019re specifically talking about oil prices? Ram Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Exactly. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Ram, we are \u2013 there\u2019s a portion of our raw materials, not a significant portion that are based on oil prices. Right now, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact from that. If we do look forward into the coming year, we\u2019ve had a couple of years where raw materials have been a tailwind to us and we do expect that to continue into 2015. Ram Sivalingam \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Understood. Thank you very much. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question/observation. If we net out productivity in investment, it seems that we have turned positive for the first time since I think Inge you have become this company\u2019s CEO. And I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 Inge Thulin : Positive in terms of what? Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, if I net out the margin impact, right, for \u2013 Inge Thulin : Oh okay, yeah. I know that. Okay. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : \u2013 discounts and productivity. Inge Thulin : Yes, yes. Yes. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. It sort of turned quite negative in 2012 and then it\u2019s been negative. And it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s now a contributor. Inge Thulin : Yes. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I\u2019m just wondering, is that sustainable or do we revert back to being negative as you continue to invest for repositioning? Nick Gangestad : Andrew, there\u2019s several things driving that productivity that you\u2019re noting. With the growth we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing improved factory utilization. But also what we\u2019re seeing in our productivity improvements is the result of our prioritization and portfolio management that you are seeing a difference there. Our business model is to drive those productivity improvements and as we\u2019ve talked about with our strategic investments, to invest that to improve our capability going forward. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. But do we think we\u2019re going to go back to sort of where it\u2019s a driver in margin or do you think it can actually turn positive \u2013 it\u2019s sustainable and positive or neutral. Nick Gangestad : Andrew, I don\u2019t see us going back into negative productivity with the current economic situations we\u2019re facing. I see it continuing neutral to slightly positive. But some of that consumed by our continued strategic investments. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. The second question, just can you give us more color on Brazil because it\u2019s an area where we get a lot of questions from investors. It seems to be a concern. But you keep posting positive numbers. Can you just give more color on industrial versus consumer businesses and if you\u2019re seeing any sort of yellow flags? You keep telling us you guys are going to do okay and believing you keep doing okay. But any color will help. Inge Thulin : Well, we were positive in Brazil this quarter. And as you probably recall, last quarter was more of a concern. So we actually turned more positive in this quarter. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. And by the way, we had 15% organic local currency growth in Mexico. So I always say when you look upon it, we have a big industrial business down there. And they grew at every at the average of the company. So I\u2019d say Brazil was types of average in terms of the growth type of mid-single digit for this quarter. And my own prediction is it will be slightly better as we move ahead. Now when you talk about some others and their performance and so forth, I cannot comment with that. But I can tell, we have been in Brazil since 1946 as we probably have talked about before. So we have a very solid organization there where we have all function in place. We have a strong manufacturing footprint in order to deliver in that local market. We have a very capable research and development organization and we have a commercialization arm that we, as you know, always going in with first. So I think one of the success factors for us is we have all functions in place in Brazil and been there for a long time. We know the market, know the culture, we\u2019re able to develop solutions for their market and produce it there in their home country. So I think that\u2019s maybe one differentiator for us versus some other people. But we saw slight uptick in this quarter versus last quarter. And I\u2019m very happy with that business there. And I\u2019m more optimistic moving forward than opposite. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Hi, thanks, and good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : I guess an impressive margin performance. That 1.4 would be even higher I guess if we exclude that healthcare gain as well. But I\u2019m trying to just maybe understand what\u2019s implied in the margin side just \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to talk about 2015, but at least fourth quarter, in terms of what you\u2019re expecting for those dynamics on that breakout chart that you gave us on Page 5. I mean how should we be thinking about how those any major changes in any of those pieces might look over the next quarter anyway? Inge Thulin : As I look out in the next quarter, we expect deals and continued benefit on price of raw materials. Pension of course will continue as a benefit. And productivity probably still continuing as a benefit. FX right now which was fairly neutral on the third quarter, I think it\u2019s more likely to think of that as a negative on the fourth quarter. Steven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay. All right. And the other question is I guess over a long period of time, various management in 3M have talked about the sustainability of healthcare margins. And we\u2019ve often heard about whether that\u2019s in the kind of mid 20s, high 20s, low 30s. Inge, maybe just provide a little bit of your perspective there. I mean should we really be thinking at this point that there\u2019s no reason to believe that you can\u2019t sustain R&D investment sales investment and still deliver those kinds of margins? Or is there a pricing pressure in some of the various developed countries that is going to make that more challenging? Inge Thulin : Well, high 20s or low 30s, they are very good. And we have a very effective model and we are very confident that the solutions that we are providing both in the developed world and the developing world will let us continue to be competitive not only the marketplace in terms of market share, but also due to our capabilities in manufacturing which is a very strong side for us to have manufacturing capabilities that is holding our cost on very low and competitive positions. So if you think about the healthcare space, generally, for many, many decades there have always been pressure in those markets. So I can recall myself when I lead back in Europe early \u201890s and so forth, there was this German Healthcare Reform Act. It was exactly what is going on from time to time in countries. So we are used to be able to scale and leverage our businesses as we go ahead. So I\u2019m not overly concerned about us being able to maintain margins at the very high level. Now we are continuing to invest and you have seen and when you look upon our mix, 75% of our business in healthcare is in developed economy. And only 25% in developing. And the growth will come there overtime and we\u2019re able to renew product and technical solutions able to put new price points based on the evidence of improved customer satisfaction in that segment. So it\u2019s a good space for us. We continue to invest and we are very, very local in all those markets. And domestic market, local market is good for us. We know how to do that. Steven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay. Fantastic. Just one point of clarification also. Based on your Venezuela comment, so just to be explicit, Latin America, Canada would have been 6.4% ex-Venezuela. Did I understand that correctly? Nick Gangestad : You understand that correctly. Steven Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research : Okay. Great. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So my first question is on free cash flow and the balance sheet. And Nick, can you provide a little bit more detail on the strong free cash flow conversion this quarter? I mean was there anything one time like an inventory flush that helped it? And then on the balance sheet, specifically you guys called out an increase of $1 billion in buyback, is the next buyback also increasing by a billion? Nick Gangestad : Yes, a couple of questions there. First of all, on the free cash flow, no, there is not one particular thing that swung that up. It\u2019s a combination of several things. Good inventory management, continuation of low needs through, be funding a strong pension, good CapEx spending in line with our expectations. It\u2019s really the combination of several things that are resulting in that 103% free cash flow conversion we saw this quarter. To your second question, the $1 billion raised on top and bottom of the range on growth share repurchases, that $1 billion would also apply to the net share repurchases range too. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe staying on the balance sheet for a second. Inge, perhaps you can provide a little color on the M&A environment. Clearly, you\u2019ve got the Sumitomo deal done but maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline, what you\u2019re seeing out there today. Inge Thulin : Yes, the pipeline is good for us as we look upon it. We have done a couple of acquisitions during the last 12 months as we talked about. Sumitomo was one that maybe you guys was not thinking so much about before we did it. But it was a very good one if you look upon the financials there. And with Treo which was a smaller one. And as Nick said, we are executing that very, very well actually and ahead of both top and bottom line relative to expectation. So every business group has a good, robust pipeline and we are looking upon them. I think the important thing for us when we look upon them, we need to make sure that first of all, they fit into our portfolio now that is categorized in terms of where we would like to go. And then also the four fundamental strings of 3M which is around technology, manufacturing capabilities, brand and the global capabilities. So we need to make sure that those four fundamentals are directly linked in so we can drive additional value as fast as possible when we do them. So I would say our pipeline is okay. The multiples are maybe too high based on how we think about it today. And as you know, the primary strategy for us is organic local currency growth. And that is why we are beating up the investment and research and development. And when I look upon what we are delivering from an organic local currency perspective, and done now for quite some time in the range of, as you know, we have about 4% to 6%. So I\u2019m happy with that. I think that\u2019s one of the things we have to remain focused on that acquisitions will be complementary and they should be strategically important and we should be able to drive value immediately for us and for you. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could sneak one more in on the electronic and energy margins that the margins. The last three quarter have been incredibly good. So maybe talk about the sustainability of what you\u2019re seeing in that specific business. Inge Thulin : So first of all, we have to go back and think about what we did in that business. We started by realigning those businesses and reduced a number of touch points out to the customers. And we did that at least two years now it seems. We tapped or realigned that organization and formed an organization that did a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re able to touch the end market. We\u2019re able to connect back to our technology platforms and respond much faster with solutions to a very fast moving market. So I think that was a key element. And we also made sure that we could get better asset utilization as we aligned the businesses. And as you know that will also then drive productivity into our organization structure, et cetera. The business have gone, since it was formed over two years ago, I think from 15, 17 and now at 15, 17 I think we start 17 this year. We are touching closer to 20 as we have said for the year. That business by definition is a little bit more volatile than the other businesses for us. But our expectation here at 3M and on that business is that they should be part of almost close to the average of the company as we move ahead. So I think we\u2019re on a much better place today based on the streamlines work we have done around the organization structure which all have been in the benefit for the customer in terms of responsiveness and for us, relative to asset utilization. Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal at FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Thank you. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning Ajay. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : So were really strong here. You\u2019ve actually seen acceleration. It looks like you had 2.6% in first quarter, 4.5%, second, and now 6%. And I guess it\u2019s not easy on accounts because you had a really good quarter last year as well. So Inge, maybe share your thoughts on what\u2019s driving this. What are you seeing broadly? How much of this growth here is end market versus some of the work you\u2019re doing? And might this be some restarting that could be contributing? Inge Thulin : Yes. No, I don\u2019t \u2013 first of all, let\u2019s \u2013 the business, if you look upon our businesses, we had good growth in all of them, different business group in United States led by industrial. So industrial had 8% growth in United States. But you had also Healthcare of 6%. And you have Safety and Graphics of 7%. So very strong robust growth. And in our view, it\u2019s not a build of inventory in the channels as we can see it. The economy has improved and we are able to capitalize on that. Now if you think about what we have done at 3M and I don\u2019t know if you recall that, but let me take you back two and a half years, so \u2013 yes, more than two and a half years, when we start to refocus our U.S. organization we had at that point in time, very much an organization that in many function were global and there\u2019s this total accountability and responsibility relative to execution on the United States subsidiary if you remind that discussion. And that work started actually in May of 2011 and have continued since in terms of making sure that there is a specific execution arms for every division in United States as well as we have had in Germany and Japan and Chile and Russia, et cetera. So I think there\u2019s two elements into it as I reflect on it. One is that we are capitalized on the economical situation in the United States. And number two, I believe that we also have moved our organization to a much more focused execution \u2013 we\u2019re a much more focused execution model in United States. So it\u2019s both and it\u2019s broad-based as I said. We have business still growing 6%, 7%, 8% in United States in the quarter. That\u2019s very, very good. And we have seen a tick up here shortly as you said from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, we see an uptick and a growth in United States. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Nick, maybe on the tax rates. So it\u2019s gone up a little bit here. I guess a part of it is mixed. But how should be think about the trajectory as you implement some of the planning initiatives say into next year? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Every quarter as you can imagine, there is puts and takes that cause the rate to fluctuate some up and down. We had some benefits of third quarter last year, not repeating. We also had some onetime expense this quarter actually related to your more long-term question, a onetime charge related to the establishment of our distribution center that we set up in the EMEA region. And so as you think about this long-term, we\u2019ve guided to expecting a 27% tax rate by 2017 and we see ourselves on track to that. Inge Thulin : Thanks, Ajay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Good morning, good morning. Just a couple of things. I know you don\u2019t want to get into a big discussion about next year, but with all the global gyrations, I thought maybe some of the non-operational things, you could at least give us a little insight on, right, the state of the globe. Maybe it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. But pension has kind of come back to the floor. It\u2019s possibly an issue for companies and we\u2019ve got this mortality table dynamic out there. So I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit of color there if there\u2019s anything to think about. And then just FX too, I mean we can all kind of try to work through our own guesstimate. But is there anything to be aware for 3M on how you\u2019re hedging or translation versus transaction to just kind of be mindful of as we try to think about what next year looks like? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Jeff, a couple of things. Of course you know we\u2019ll share full details in December on many things. But for a couple that you\u2019re asking about, I think they\u2019re both worthy of mention right now. First of all, on the second part of your question on FX, with the movement we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, our estimate if we were to take FX rate as they exist right now is that year-on-year in 2015, we expect about $0.10 headwind on earnings per share. That\u2019s a net after hedging impact. And in comparison, that\u2019s to a $0.15 headwind that we\u2019re expecting in 2014. On your first part of your question on the pension, multiple factors going into that \u2013 the asset returns we\u2019re experiencing this year, the discount rate expectation and the mortality table. If I take all three of those in combination, we\u2019re looking \u2013 we\u2019re estimating at least $100 million headwind going into 2015 on earnings per share on our earnings next year. I think that covers what you were asking, Jeff. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Yes, it does. And maybe just one more and I\u2019ll move on. I think your tax rate has crept up this year in your guide because you were anticipating the extenders and everything. And it looks like that\u2019s not happening. But should we expect any tax rate headwinds? And I kind of ask the question in the spirit of this U.S. strength? Is there any kind of move in the mix of your earnings that are actually tax rate negative that we should be thinking about or anything else that\u2019s idiosyncratic to 3M that may affect the tax rate? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Jeff. The tax rate is impacted by our mix of profits we earn around the world. Our current guidance of 28.5% to 29% takes into account that current mix we\u2019re expecting for 2014. And on the extenders, we currently are still building that into our estimate for 2014. And if it doesn\u2019t pass, that would likely put us at the high end of the range that I\u2019ve talked about. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Okay. All right. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Hey, good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Clearly, some very good execution against the tougher Forex and global environment out there. The margin was definitely stronger than we were expecting I guess. In the context of what I see here as kind of a 75% incremental margin year-over-year and the thing that kind of stands out the most obviously is this productivity line. Utilization, I kind of understand, what do you mean by portfolio management exactly? What is that? Nick Gangestad : Portfolio management, Steve, is some of the actions we\u2019ve been taking as part of our strategic investments to in some cases combined businesses for efficiency and better relevance to our customers as well as some restructuring expenses that we\u2019ve taken. That when we say portfolio management in that regard, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Stephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : So it\u2019s not like a year-over-year. This is like blocking and tackling on cost takeout from business combinations? Nick Gangestad : Exactly. Stephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Okay. And then just in the fourth quarter here. I guess it seems a pretty steady state organic growth you\u2019re guiding to, any kind of movement around the various pieces of the business geographically in the fourth quarter? Inge Thulin : No, not where we can see at this point in time. See, we have guidance there, we are 4% to 5% for the year and we feel confident around that. Stephen Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Inge Thulin : Yes. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Oh, good morning. Thanks for the \u2013 Inge Thulin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Nick, you mentioned $100 million for the pension at the current discount rate [ph], does that then feed [ph] mortality tables because I get $100 million just with discount rates. But you mentioned mortality table as well. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Nigel, that\u2019s taking three things into account \u2013 us adopting the new mortality table, a roughly 50 basis point drop in our discount rate and the asset returns that we have experienced and are expecting to experience for 2014. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And that\u2019s very helpful. And then obviously the margin strength has been discussed [indiscernible] so far. If I had to speak into the next layer, looking at the SG&A as portions of sales down I think about 70 basis points year-over-year and R&D flat. And I\u2019m wondering, given that global IPI has come in a little bit weaker than we all expected, is there any element of just putting back a little bit on growth investments, a bit more action on cost control at this point just given the movements we see in SG&A and R&D? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, what we\u2019re seeing on the movement there is function of our normal drive on productivity. It\u2019s not really a change in our trajectory on our growth investments that we\u2019re making. Those are continuing. We are on year-on-year seeing a pension benefit that\u2019s impacting SG&A. And then to the later point I made, the portfolio management where we\u2019ve been taking some restructuring actions, we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits that those manifest in our SG&A expenses. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. That\u2019s great. And just finally, microchip born, if you like, on electronics end markets earlier this month, are you seeing any weakening at all in all the markets for 3M? Inge Thulin : No, we did not see that at all. So our electronics business did very well as you saw with, I think we called it out with 8% organic local currency growth. So we didn\u2019t see anything on that. I think the external data at least going back to Q2 was indicating then at that market went sideway overall, right, so now then it\u2019s for you if you\u2019re in that segment then depending what you are in that segment, then it\u2019s coming down to execution. Make sure that you capitalize on the market overall. Based on our portfolio, we didn\u2019t see that. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you very much guys. Inge Thulin : Okay. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. Matt Ginter : Oh real quickly, thanks for participating this morning. It was a good call. We look forward to seeing you December if not before. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 27, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 business review. Let me kick off with the remainder of our upcoming 2015 earnings call dates. April 23rd, July 23rd and October 22nd. Also, mark your calendars for our next Investor Meeting schedule for December 15th. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now if you please turn to slide three and I\u2019ll hand off to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 3M finished the year strong, delivered both record sales and record earnings in the fourth quarter. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere, in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. I\u2019ll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year, sales was $7.7 billion, the fourth quarter record, organic growth companywide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other four business groups, Healthcare, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America, Canada grew 9%, while Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 3%. Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%. Yet, we still delivered good top and bottomline growth. Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong cash flow with the conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and in December, we announced the 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. Overall, we finished the year strong and I thank entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now go through the details. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide four, where I'll review the components of our fourth quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3%, with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All-in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013. Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America, Canada, where Electronics and Energy, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was up slightly. Asia-Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Healthcare led the way with growth of 12% and 9%, respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding Electronics. China, Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6%, led by Industrial at 10%, Healthcare, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa each grew double digits, while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in four of our by businesses, led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter. Turn to slide five for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year, while continuing to invest for the future. I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we close out Q4 and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs, and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific. Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity, resulting in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.05 a share, given the broad based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added a penny to per share earnings and average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share. Now I will review cash flow performance on slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion. We continue to manage toward a better optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage which we are using for two purposes; first, to invest in our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically. We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16th, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2013. Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with industrial on slide seven. Industrial with sales of $2.6 billion delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced Materials led the way with double-digit growth. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation business generated high single-digit growth and we also saw strong growth in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Auto OEM. All regions delivered growth for Industrial paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in the three industrial heartland businesses, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6%, followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%. Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5% down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends and for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013. Let's now look at Healthcare on slide eight. Healthcare delivered another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion in organic growth of over 6%. Every Healthcare business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care posted strong growth in the quarter. Health Information Systems and Food Safety, each grew double digits. Healthcare grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin American/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Healthcare grew 15% organically marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time and these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives. Please turn to slide nine. Electronics and Energy continue to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our electronics related businesses as we continue to see strong and customer demand, enhanced by spec-end wins at several OEMs. In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales increased 2%. The electrical markets business was up high-single digits while renewable energy and telecom both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year. Please turn to slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal Safety grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, Commercial Solutions grew mid-single digits and organic sales declined slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security. Asia-Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin America, Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in United States. Operating income was $285 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity. I will finish with the Consumer business group found on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of nearly 6%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace, with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in Consumer, Healthcare, with notable strength in our FUTURO branded health supports. Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by strong holiday selling of Scotch and other 3M branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America, Canada and 5% in Asia-Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year. Operating income increased 12% to $254 million and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continue to drive efficiencies across the business. That wraps up my review of the quarter. I will hand it back to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we deliver a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area, with a good balance between developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here in St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings-per-share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS at 11.5%. On organic growth, our target is 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%. Driving our success is the scale of our people and the strings of our business model, which includes three key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from six sectors to five business groups and for 40 businesses to 27. In 2014, we combined businesses within three of our business groups, Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $19 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our static control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity. Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M\u2019s primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strings of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally. The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create a more ideal and efficient 3M, and allow us to better serve customers around the world. Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these three levers, is continuing to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015. Please turn to slide 13 and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, as evident in our fourth quarter and full year results, we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one month ago and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remain to 28% to 29%, with free cash conversion of 90% to 100%. As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we now welcome your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question. Ajay Kejriwal : Thank you. Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Ajay. Ajay Kejriwal : And congratulations. Very nice results. So if I just look at the organic growth, to me it seems like to defining all the negatives macro headlines out there, imagine a lot of what you are seeing, what you are doing there, looks like share gains. But just maybe a couple on that, a big shoe is one, just on your take on what the macro is. What you are seeing by geography and then second, if you are able to identify a path to some of the markets that you are seeing share gains without imaging some of this as share gains in terms of the growth of those markets? Inge Thulin : Well, thank you. First of all, we are pleased to see the momentum that has build over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth. And for me specifically why that is very encouraging is that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States but also outside of United States to make sure we are becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it\u2019s broad-based. And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the five business groups, we are very diversified from a business group perspective and we are very diversified geographically as well, with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it\u2019s very nice to see it all coming together for us. When we looked up on the result for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, they\u2019re not changing the range for us. We still believe -- we had a United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15 3% to 6% in the range. We believe that will be on the high end of that range in my mind as we see it here today doing very, very well. APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit both in China for us and in Southeast Asia. And Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look upon that in terms of a range for the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China is probably 4% to 10%, and Japan a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow. Latin America, as you saw, came back -- and Latin America and Canada came back this quarter. And we talked about that in the last call where we said see 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year. And we are still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look upon North America; U.S., Canada, Mexico has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we have -- we\u2019d say, as we said before, a little bit of question mark. We\u2019ve had that in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe -- Europe, Middle East, Africa 3% for the quarter. And as we produce quite a bit in those countries, in terms of export that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead. And as you know, it\u2019s not only that research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth by the way, but also the strategy we\u2019ve had around domestic business model should play for us here. So -- and when you ask about market share and so forth, we have many businesses, so it\u2019s difficult to go through all of them. But when I look upon, it is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses. Ajay Kejriwal : Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. And then quick one for Nick. Maybe on the currency exposures, Nick, any color on how you positioned in terms of hedging both natural and through contract? And then maybe any comments on your Swiss franc exposure, please? Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Yes, Ajay, if we go back to the December 16th earnings outlook meeting, at that time we shared that we expected FX to impact our earnings per share negatively in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20. With the movement in the foreign exchange rates that we\u2019ve seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of that range as that is hurting 3M\u2019s earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year. Our approach in managing that is really unchanged and it\u2019s on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges, and that\u2019s been demonstrated time and after time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure and we hedge that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenor out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed -- some of the developed countries we are in such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities and sources of supply and in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. And that\u2019s much of the story we\u2019ve had in the past and it remains the same in 2015. As far as your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there and that will have a immaterial impact on our results in 2015. Ajay Kejriwal : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Thanks. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I wanted to follow up on the question on currency a bit. And just how do you guys think about adjusting production or changing how think about your -- how you supply the marketplace, just given the fairly violent swings we\u2019ve had in currency? And like, for example if Canadian dollar is falling as dramatically as it has, does it make sense to produce in that country and export into U.S.? Are there other things that you can do that could help mitigate the impact? Nick Gangestad : Scott, that\u2019s a good and interesting question. And I will just put it in a short-term and long-term perspective. From a short-term perspective, this isn\u2019t the type of thing that week to week, month to month that we fluctuate are production from one part of the world to the next. Our number one focus is how are we going to serve our customers locally? And then from there we then focus on, are there opportunities? So I will use the eurozone right now where we have a European Center of Excellence, that\u2019s looking at what kind of opportunities do we have with the current FX rates on the euro. Looking at our material costs, are there potentials to renegotiate purchase prices, material localization? Does it create new opportunities for us to source something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange rate to our advantage? In times like this, it also causes to manage our spending, probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then to what you\u2019re talking, that\u2019s a little longer-term, looking at regional sales sufficiency. We do have manufacturing capability to manufacture products that has spread around the world, and then we use movements like this to look for those opportunities. That\u2019s going on constantly, and it\u2019s a heightened case for us right now, Scott. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then when you look at our CapEx budget for 2015, I am just trying to get a sense of where the priorities, where do you -- where are you investing? And once -- I mean, this question asked a couple years ago would have been all China or I mean other emerging markets. And has that shifted at all back to more developing nations? Or just give us a sense of, maybe think about the priorities for the 1.5 billion where you\u2019re going to spend money? Nick Gangestad : Scott, I characterize our priorities as fairly balanced and not changing in 2015. And there is couple dimensions to talk about that. First of all, we tried to have a nice balance of where we are investing in growth, expanding our capabilities and our capacity to meet local customer requirements. Second, we are also investing in increasing our competitiveness, often that\u2019s in renewal or enhancements to existing manufacturing sites we have. And then third, there are some strategic investments we\u2019re making where it might be expanding in a new geography or one of our significant strategic investments is our investment in business transformation and ERP. Geographically, we continue to see a nice balance of where that's going. It\u2019s not skewing more to developing markets, right now. In 2015, we see it bounce very close to what we've had in the last two year. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. Great job, guys. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, in terms of restructuring in the quarter, it seems like strategic investments reaccelerated versus the third quarter. So the first thing, can you just -- you mentioned $30 million for restructuring in Q4, what was the 3Q number if you could remind us? And then, if you could just talk about the balance of strategic investments and restructuring versus the benefit, because last quarter they turned positive and we're back to being negative. Just how should I think about the benefits of restructuring going forward? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Andrew, a couple points on that. Yes, our $30 million that was restructuring portfolio actions that we took in a few of our business, in electronics, in energy, safety and graphics, and healthcare. And as I said earlier spread geographically, but most heavily concentrated in Western Europe for a total of $30 million. And that was very close to zero in Q3 of 2014. So an up-tick from the level we saw one quarter before. Returns that we see on this will vary by geography. The restructuring actions we\u2019re taking in United States we see paybacks occurring within the next calendar year or less than 12 months. The paybacks that we see on our Western European portfolio actions typically take longer, and we see paybacks that can take two or three years on those investments. Andrew Obin : But just as we're thinking about the paybacks, right, because obviously you've been reinvesting for a couple of years now. And as I said, just going back last quarter you had a pretty positive tailwind from the benefits. And this quarter I think it was relatively flat. How should I think about that going forward? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Thinking about that going forward Andrew, part of what I laid out for 2015 is that we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of productivity benefits and part of our margin expansion in 2015 versus 2014, a portion of that productivity benefit. And I will roughly attribute one-third of that productivity benefit is coming from past restructuring activities that 3M is invested in. Andrew Obin : Got you. That's great. And just a small follow-up. What's your assumption for oil price, that's baked into your forecast for the year? Nick Gangestad : Andrew, for the year, we are estimating that oil prices are going to average $50 a barrel. And while you're on the subject in the December 16th earnings call part of my outlook at that time was that raw materials we expected to benefit, our earnings per share in 2015 by $0.15 to $0.25. With our latest assumption on oil prices, we\u2019re now right at the high end of that estimate. We\u2019re still in the estimate but now at the very high end of it. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Nick Gangestad : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : And a nice quarter. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Joe Ritchie : Just my first question is on price cost. Nick, you've been talking for a while that we're going to start to see a lower benefit from price cost, and historically over the past year you've done closer to about 100 basis points, and you\u2019ve got 60 basis points this quarter. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the dynamic this quarter, was it because you lap some pricing increases, and how should we think about pricing in '15? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Joe, yes it did come through almost exactly like as we were describing. The components of what we\u2019re seen there, we did have significant price growth in 2013 and there is a bit of lapping occurring there. We do continue to still see strength of the 3M product innovation flow, the strength of the 3M brand, and the impact that has on pricing. FX in the first part of 2014 had a more pronounced impact on our pricing growth and that abated some in the fourth quarter. Party of the mix of where the FX movements have been occurring, it\u2019s much more in developed markets in currency such as the Europe. And then going forward, we continue to expect low price growth of all of our organic growth, the 3% to 6% that we\u2019re projecting for 2015. We\u2019re expecting the vast majority of that to be in volume growth and not price growth. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up for Inge. Inge, you mentioned earlier on M&A, you mentioned Sumitomo. I was just wondering whether the environment recently with the evaluations coming down in certain end markets, whether things have gotten anymore attractive in terms of the pipeline from an M&A standpoint. Inge Thulin : Are you talking overall M&A pipeline? You don\u2019t talk specifically Japan but you talk overall. Joe Ritchie : Right now, overall. Inge Thulin : Overall, yes, our pipeline is robust and we are working at constantly. And as I said earlier, I feel that we\u2019re on a much better position now to really identify the most attractive pieces for us as we have better -- much better understanding today versus two, three years ago of positions in our portfolio in between the different businesses. And also when we now have identified the real fundamental strengths of 3M which is for us, which around the technology, manufacturing a global capability and brand equity. So we say that we are in a much better position today in order to be able to look upon them and identify them et cetera. So that's good. And we have as I said earlier from my move from a more of a bottom-up approach, we have complement that that with the top-down approach as well in order to make sure that we can identify and find something that can be used more broad based in the organization. Ceradyne was probably the first one around those acquisitions, and is working out very well and again had a very good quarter for us at this quarter end. So think about it in that respect, we find that that\u2019s very attractive with us, that there is both sustainable end market that is interesting but also some technology for us that we can expand into our auto platforms which is an important thing for us. And technology innovation for us is important for us in order to create more value for customers and for our shareholder. So it\u2019s an important element. Joe Ritchie : Thanks for the color and nice quarter. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks, and good morning all. I wondered if we could dig in a little more in that pricing point, specifically around your ability to price versus translation and other currency effects competitively in Europe and Latin America. So to what extent is there a lag here and those pricing actions being taken? So when I looked at that 1.4% on price in EMEA and 3% Latin America, Canada versus minus 9.79%, should we count on that catching up a bit in the next quarter or two? And then Inge, just strategically as you think about this going forward, any competitive dynamics that change as a result of that currency fluctuation? Nick Gangestad : Yeah, Steven, in the past you\u2019ve witnessed for price growth when it\u2019s driven by FX reductions in the last couple of years primarily in developing markets, you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant amount of that recaptured in price. If I were you modeling, I would not be modeling that same ratio of pricing actions to offset that. The businesses are out there engaged, working on where the opportunities are for offsetting some of that FX in price but the ratios that we've experienced in the past are not going to be the same as what we're going to see in Western Europe. There are some parts of EMEA though where we are changing our pricing to be U.S. dollar priced, which will bolster our price growth there. But the guidance I gave Steve is tamper that ratio that you\u2019ve historically seen. Inge Thulin : Yeah, and coming back Steve, if I may on your question. I think, one important thing is to just recognize the investments that we have done over years under the umbrella of domestic demand and domestic manufacturing, which is helping you a lot relative to issues like this. I think the other thing is the technology innovation will by definition in most businesses help you. And the way we look upon all business, we have one that I will describe as a design and spec-end business and then you have one on consumables. On design and spec-end businesses where you provide technology innovation that is coming on platforms, that's a big advantage for us because the technology is there and in most cases, we are able to produce locally. So another thing is over one-third of our businesses in United States. And as I\u2019ve said before, 3M never left United States, we stayed here. In fact, I\u2019ve also invested this year in more capacity specifically, in our Healthcare business. So I see in terms of some competitive moves -- from time to time that can be in my view in smaller countries around the world, maybe some push in the low end of the portfolio from some local competitors. But I think, that\u2019s not what 3M is all about based on our business model, generally speaking. So we should be able to hold in there. And as I said, probably gain market share as we move ahead, like I am generally speaking very, very pleased with execution relative to our commercialization capabilities in the company. And I\u2019m very pleased to see how that momentum had built now for five, six quarters, slightly stronger every quarter, so that's good. Steven Winoker : 3M use to quote a percentage of regional production for regional consumption or supply, which you refer to several times now to this call. You have a sense for how high that is these days? Inge Thulin : It depends on the region by definition and it\u2019s slightly higher in West Europe and United States versus in APAC and Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. But we are pushing that I would say, as we move ahead, but also being thoughtful relative, so we do not build too much capacity and duplicate efforts. So it\u2019s I think have been a big effort and as you remember that we talked in the past about slightly complicated supply chain operation. And as maybe I said to many of you is that that\u2019s a big thing now that we go after as we move into \u201815 as to make sure we get much more streamlined supply chain and better cost of good sold and better inventory management and so forth. Steven Winoker : And was wage inflation, anything unusual in the quarter at all and then when you did a productivity 10 basis point number, I assume that net of wage inflation? Nick Gangestad : Yes. That is net of wage. And no, we're not seeing anything unusual in wage inflation or wage pressures, very normal trends for us. Steven Winoker : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Shannon. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey. Can you just dig a little bit more into this U.S. Industrial strength? You said it was up 10% in the quarter and I think, the -- you mentioned the Safety business was also strong in manufacturing? What\u2019s sort of strongest thing you're seeing there and your confidence level what\u2019s -- where you see changing? Inge Thulin : Well, yeah, so first of all, the two businesses as you talked about Industrial by definition, core Industrial and Personal Safety, they often growing hand by hand, right. So we saw good growth there. So for us, we saw Aerospace and Transportation in high single-digit growth and if you take the core business, which is, I will categorize as adhesives and tape and abrasives, we saw very good growth. We saw adhesives and tape that this is our biggest division. We saw that at 8% growth in the quarter and we also saw automotive at 5%. So I would say it was broad-based in United States in those businesses. And as I said earlier, you think about at for us as a design and spec-in, where you have coming in on products and platforms, and then you have the consumables where you\u2019re using our products in your manufacturing operation and so forth. So I would say it was broad-based and when I looked upon the growth for the businesses in Industrial, they -- we were around 5 plus for every business in United State. So very strong and as you said, Personal Safety was even higher than that. So it looks good for us and the team is executing well. So it\u2019s good. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then, 3M is pretty interesting view into how the impact of lower oil prices is actually going to impact, demand in the economy and sort of the positives and the negatives of that? Do you have any kind of early read on that or anything your sense in your businesses or seem talking your business leaders or a view of how this might play out? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Shannon, the impact on the business and our ability to organic growth, I really don't have any insight to share there of anything changing in the market as a result. The primary impact we are seeing is what's coming out us with commodity prices. And what we\u2019ve been seen in what we\u2019re paying for commodities so far this year and why I'm saying that we\u2019re now on the high-end of our $0.15 to $0.25 benefit from raw material prices. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Do you have any sense sort of an early pickup and better consumer spending in your businesses because consumers have more discretionary? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. We haven't seen that yet, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks a lot. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : My first question was on R&D and Inge, I know that there is a plan to ramp up R&D to a 6% level? But it didn\u2019t look like it started to happen this quarter, actually declined year-over-year? I know it probably shouldn\u2019t be a linear process, but maybe if you could comment on R&D spending over the next couple of quarters? Inge Thulin : Yeah. Well, first of all, it\u2019s -- we see improved productivity coming out of the laboratories, which we are very pleased about. If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5% of -- from 5.5% to 6% increase in spending is around disruptive technologies and this is now going into the third year. So, overall, we have 30 programs that are funded, 19 of them came on in 2013, seven in 2014 and we are looking for another four here in 2015. So the investment of it over the years have been 82 in \u201914 and was 40 in \u201813 and we plan for another 70 plus this year. Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization and that's in Healthcare, Infrastructure and Transportation, Electronics and Consumer markets. So we had sales from those investments in 2014 for around $150 million and we are looking, as I said, in New York for around $250 million as we go ahead. So we will continue to invest and our -- as we have talked about in the past, our new product Vitality Index is robust 32%, 33%, that's a good place for us to be and we are continuing to invest in. Now that -- it's -- the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by that because as you see, we are running in the middle of a range of 4 to 6. Now, we are running around 5, in fact, this quarter on the high-end of that range so. And that is clear evidence that new programs have been introduced as we go. And we had quite a number of new products introduced in 2014, have hit the market. So it was $10.4 billion of new products hitting the market from 3M 2014. So, I'm not -- we continue to invest, but they are not excluded from productivity improvements. Deane Dray : That\u2019s great color. And then my second question, I want to go back to the hedging practices to Nick for a moment. And it was interesting to hear that your response has been to extend the duration of your hedges from 12 months to 24 months. And we are seeing companies in both new hedging practices. We saw GE doing that. Honeywell has done that .So you\u2019ve extended the duration. But I was curious why would you not increase the percent of your current hedges from 50%, or let's say, 75%? Did you look at that what the costs are there? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Dean thanks for asking and clarifying a question on that. One of the constraints or governs our ability to hedge is qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. And if we go over a 50% in most cases, we would then be subject to mark-to-market accounting and therefore defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do with our hedging processing. In fact, we\u2019d probably add more volatility if we did that. So that's the upper limit constraint on what we can. And part of our approach, if I go back over a decade, is not to eliminate all the risks there. Our approach is to give the business some time to react and adjust to the changing business conditions and that's consistent with our 50% strategy. Deane Dray : Great. Nick, that clarification was real helpful. We would rather not see you go through the currency mark-to-market gyrations. So we\u2019ll live with the 50% then. Thanks. Nick Gangestad : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : What you guys seeing in Europe, specifically maybe in some of your Industrial verticals? Inge Thulin : Well. First of all it\u2019s -- I would say, as you saw relative to the growth for the quarter for us in Europe, it was okay I would say. And I would say that specifically, we had a good growth in some of the businesses that specific around automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal safety, which is very much related into the Industrial space. So it\u2019s still a slow growth, generally speaking over there. But I think personally with the trend relative to the currency, that we would see more export coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong. I would say in all Industrial position and in Healthcare. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So, I think as export will increase as we go, I think that we\u2019ll have 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years. I think four years relative to the structure over there. So, I think one of the thing that -- sometime it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth. But I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we have talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out, quite a bit of layers and management into organization, while we kept the front-end of the organization in terms of execution. So let\u2019s say, I think we are in a good place in Europe, but it\u2019s not an easy environment as we all know. But there is no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us, our Electronic and Energy and Consumer businesses as a smaller big mix in Europe. And I would say specifically Consumer, Electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in energy. Consumer retail is by definition a small portion for us so, and I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks. Just one last question. I know this is a dumb question for you guys. But is there any quantification of what you guys sell in and around the oil and gas markets? Is there any quantification of whether it's 2% to 3%, or do you guys have visibility on what you may sell in and around those markets, whether it\u2019s adhesives or anything like that\u2019s going to those economies? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Steve, yeah, we do look at this and approximately 3% of our revenue is into the oil and gas industry. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thank you. Very helpful. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jermaine Brown of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jermaine Brown : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Jermaine. Jermaine Brown : Most of my questions have already been answered already. So real quick. Over the course of the year, how do you expect the raw material tailwinds to flow through your income statement given the moving crude oil prices? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. With the move, we expect it to be mostly balanced through the year. If there's going to be a slight bias, it\u2019s going to be slightly backend loaded but not markedly so. Jermaine Brown : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. Matt Ginter : Well, thanks for joining us and what I know is a very busy earnings day. I appreciate your participation. We look forward to seeing you during the year. Good bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, July 23, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, which is scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3, and I will hand out to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved these against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop. The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures. As 3M always does, we continue to manage two things within our control; execute our plan and build for the future. I'll take you through the first quarter highlights. Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%. For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against a number of currencies, reducing sales by 6.5%. We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year, and all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last three years are paying off. This quarter 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio. We announce plans to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business; and at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January. Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of 35% increase last year. Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks, Inge, and good mornings, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change. As Inge mentioned, in the quarter we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3% with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%. Two Health Care related acquisitions, namely, Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing the trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real 19%. Looking more closely at organic local currency growth, Asia-Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%. Organic growth was 7% in China/Hong Kong or 8%, excluding electronics, similar to recent quarters. Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014, consumption tax increase. EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid-single digits and Middle East/Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively. We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America/Canada, where Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care, all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer, each growing 4%; Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy, each grew 3%. Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income on the other hand increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share. Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place and we executed those plans as Q1 played out. Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity, allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point. Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion. We continued to generate positive selling prices changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum, as the year progresses. Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remains under good control in the quarter, and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins. First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continue to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate. Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point. Now, let's turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $90 million or the equivalents of $0.10 a share. The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05. The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a one-time benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share. Now, let's review cash flow performance on Slide number 7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar. First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the rage of 90% to 100%. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. Now, let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide number 8. Industrial with sales of $2.7 billion delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our aerospace and commercial transportation, automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses, all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in advanced materials and industrial adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada set the pace, with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%; Asia Pacific increased 3%; and EMEA was flat. We continue to invest for the future within Industrial. During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company. Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance, operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1. Now, let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high single-digits in the quarter. Workers safety remains a high priority for manufacturers globally, and we're gaining share. In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security, each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules declined year-on-year. Asia-Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continue to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management. Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food safety, critical in chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year. Geographically, organic growth in Asia-Pacific was 8%, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%, EMEA declined 1%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as healthcare markets rapidly evolve in developing countries. In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access products offerings to healthcare facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to expanding this business globally. Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remain strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%. Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local currency growth in the first quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local currency sales grew 12% in our electronics related businesses, as we continue to see strong consumer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 7% in Asia-Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both U.S. and Latin America/Canada. The divestiture of the Static Control Business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014. Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins. Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, with organic growth of 2%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by Do-It-Yourself and Home Care, each growing mid-single digit. Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia-Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America/Canada declined slightly year-on-year. Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs. Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million. That wraps up our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, where I will address our full year planning estimates.On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then the dollar has strengthened further. Today we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share, or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging. For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share. For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate. Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year. I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. I am pleased with the performance of our team in the first quarter. We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now, more than ever, our teams remain keenly focus on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth, and of course, productivity. As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment, clearly necessary given external realities. As we navigate short term challenges we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strengths. I have talked to you before about 3M's four fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise : technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter while at the same time managing our SG&A investments very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities including breaking ground on the new customer innovation center in Chengdu in West China. As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China. And our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely both, the local and global customers and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China. In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline : 3M Science Applied to Life. Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives. So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds, and we continue to make investments for the future. And by that we are now open to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Inge, perhaps maybe just focusing on organic growth for a second, the 3%-plus that you did this quarter was towards the lower end of your full year range, and yet as you progressed through the year your comps are going to get a little bit more difficult, so maybe you can just talk about the portfolio and the confidence and perhaps seeing some organic growth acceleration as the year progresses. Inge Thulin : Yes, you're right. It was little bit slower than we have seen in the past. The way I looked upon it is specifically as you came off Q4, it was around 6%, but I think overall when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global basis. So I think first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the level as we have seen in the past. I think when you look upon our performance, as you see there, you see a little bit of lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One, it's relative to West Europe and it's relative to our Drug Delivery Systems, that is I would say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on yearend or quarter. So when I look at on Health Care, that's basically where you can see. And our core business in Health Care did very well again, and as you see we maintain very high margin, et cetera. And when I look upon Industrial, we had 4% growth in United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable, and I think that was related very much to and became maybe some uncertainty generally speaking around what will happen to export due to the dollar strengthening and also what you saw in oil. I think people, specifically not so much what is designed in and spec-in, but maybe on the consumables, just became a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue either. And as you know that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's our biggest. It's 33% of our portfolio. So again Electronic and Energy did very well. After the reorganization and realignment of that business now over two years ago, we really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed to market, et cetera. And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter, and specifically in personal safety that is going into respiratory business, we are doing very well on a global basis, even it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter, but very well in Asia again and whole of APAC doing very, very well. And then finally, Consumer, that you saw had a 2% growth; 4% was in U.S. which is our bigger business. And I will say that the slowness was in West Europe, and Latin America was slow for them. So as we all know, a quarter stops and ends there is always something going in and out of the quarter. I look very carefully on six months comparisons going back over two years, and when we look upon that over two years with six months comparisons, because you don't know always if new story is coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera. We have for the last two years on that comparison been in the range of 4% to 6%, always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the low end, but still in the 3% to 6% that we have set for the year and when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we see going out for the year, we say that maybe Q2 would be very similar to Q1, maybe slight improvement, but we do not count too much on that. And then you will see for the rest of the year that more growth will come. Joe Ritchie : And maybe my one follow-up question for Nick. Can you decompose the price cost for the quarter? You had 120 basis points in benefit, what portion of it was related to FX? And can you elaborate a little bit on the raw material piece gaining momentum as the year progresses? Nicholas Gangestad : Sure, Joe, happy to break that down. As I said earlier in total those components price in raw materials added a 120 basis points. You can split that right down the middle. Half of that is coming from selling price increases, and half of that is coming from lower raw material commodity prices that we're paying. And then in total what we recorded for 1% price growth for the first quarter, Joe, about two-thirds of that is directly or indirectly driven by FX movements, and about one-third of that is driven by 3M innovation and the new product flow we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis : A little bit of strange question for you, Inge, but when you think about China, up 7% is a very, very respectable number, but Consumer is up kind of 2-ish, and you seem to be doing really well in China in Auto and Industrial, but Consumer always seems to be a little bit of a challenge. Can you help us understand, is it a function of price points of brand, or focus is there -- when we think about the Consumer build out in China, there seems to be an opportunity for you guys, but I'm not sure your business is really that big in the grand scheme of things over there and doesn't seem to be growing up fast? Inge Thulin : First of all, yes, we do well in China. We have good traction. And again, this quarter we had 7% growth, n fact 8% in the core business if you take out electronics. As I talked earlier, the way the evolution of businesses are going is stopping with Industrial, followed by Electronic and Energy, then Safety, then Consumer, finally Health Care. So Consumer part is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well. I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind, it's where we all grew up what we are used to, et cetera. So it takes longer time in order for you to build the awareness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer, but in that specific market I would turn Health Care and Consumer around, and say, Health Care would get faster traction for us than Consumer. So I will say, I agree with you. I hope we will be bigger at this point in time. I hope we're being able to grow faster, that we will over time. So we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category, and we also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel partners. So I think, over the time it will be big. We'll grow faster. And we have to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right. So we are not giving away things, and it's not only about market share, we need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get the good return. And there is some very good businesses for us in China to speak, as you know, both in specifically in Industrial -- specifically Industrial. One I can't talk about purification, it is growing fantastically. We've continued to invest in that. So I hope that will gave you a little bit of flavor why it's small. Scott Davis : And then as a follow-up to that, I mean when you think about pricing going on getting 1% price in this type of a lower raw material environment and challenging macro in general, what is the interplay between price and volumes? I mean, did you give up some volume this quarter to get that price? It's hard to say with some of your markets you create the categories, so it seems like you should be able to get pretty good pricing power. But clearly, with the currency moves, I would imagine if you have some local competitors that might able to keep price a little bit lower for a while and take some share, what do you think about that? Nicholas Gangestad : Scott, we don't see that we're giving up volumes in exchange for price. And it really comes back to 3M's business model of investing in innovation, having that strong new product flow. It gives us the ability to reflect the value that we're creating in the markets and for our customers. So it's something we're conscious of, we monitor. But right now, Scott, we're not seeing our stance on pricing, in light of the current cost raw materials as impacting our volumes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : On the topic of FX, Nick, maybe if you could help critique the effectiveness of the new hedging program, you extended the duration from 12 to 24 months, but how is that program working versus your expectations? Nicholas Gangestad : For those that may not know what Deane is talking about, in the middle of 2014 we extended the tenure in our hedging programs to go out from our past policy of going out and hedging 12 months out to now hedge in addition to that 24 and 36 months out. And to answer your question it's going quite well, Deane. The true impacts of going out with the tenure in 24 and 36 months, that will manifest in 2016. And if you look at the amount of deferred gains that we have in our hedging program, that's reflective of that change in our hedging program. Deane Dray : And then a follow-up would be for Inge on the Polypore acquisition. And maybe if you could just take us through, and maybe this has a little bit of the boost that Ceradyne gave you, was where else will you apply ultrafiltration across 3M's businesses? And then within your answer, maybe what does ultrafiltration give you that CUNO did not? Inge Thulin : First of all, as we not have closed on Polypore, I would not like to talk about that specifically, right. So we have to respect the regulatory approvals that we are waiting for. So I will not talk about that. But if you think about it broader relative to our filtration business, that is a huge opportunity for us. And I will look upon that and I will combine it, if you like to think about it in terms of our non-woven technologies combined with what we have in our purification business, and then some additional technologies that will be added later on. So if you think about a global mega trend that are related to both air pollution and clean water, that is where we will play big time with the platform, as we go ahead. So I will say that I am very encouraged actually relative to our current performance, both in purification and in personal safety that is around respiratory products. And we will build out those businesses as we go. So think about it as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both global mega trend, but also local mega trends. And as Scott and I talked about it earlier, relative to China, this is a huge opportunity, as we all know and everyone know that. But we need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies, because at the end of the day this is very much a regulatory business, and we need to make sure we have product that meet the standards. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Did you all see any volume de-stocking across your distribution in any of the business units? We've been hearing some short-term trends in some other companies on that front. Inge Thulin : De-stocking or? Steven Winoker : De-stocking, yes? Inge Thulin : I think that when you look upon it, I will not say, yes, bit time. But I suspect that all of us leading businesses, like we do at 3M and our customers, as some uncertainty came in Q1, as I said earlier, both relative to exports from U.S. based on the strength of the dollar and oil price. I think that most companies, generally speaking were very careful of how you build and manage your inventory in Q1. So I think I will be surprised, even if I don't have any facts in front of me, to say that people manage the inventory very tightly and as tight as they could in Q1, and so did we, by the way, right. So I think that's the answer. Matt Ginter : Maybe one comment in the Consumer business, which you'll see in one of the slides, our point of sale growth was good and it was higher than our actual growth. So there may have been a little bit of inventory takeout at the retail channel. Steven Winoker : And then, Matt, on the Consumer side, I think that was still the lowest growth since, like what, maybe the fourth quarter of '13. Was that related in any way? Matt Ginter : Yes. That was the point. The outdoor sales were actually better than that. So there is some adjustment there in the channel. Steven Winoker : And then just a follow-up question on pricing. You mentioned earlier that two-thirds of the 1% pricing increase was FX related and a-third roughly it was new product development and et cetera. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you seeing pressure on pricing in that you think is currency driven in other markets from an export prospect from your competition. Is this something where people are trying to take advantage of it? Nicholas Gangestad : Steve, that's something we're constantly on the lookout for as in the time volatile FX. So this is changing the competitive landscape for us. And at this point we are not seeing evidence of it changing our competitive landscape or our ability to price in manner similar than how we priced in the past in multiple geographies, including the United States. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Shannon OCallaghan : Maybe just a follow-up on the tightly managing business in the first quarter, as you mentioned you're kind of doing that with inventories and others are as well with FX and oil uncertainty. Is that uncertainty now viewed is or do you view it as having lessened, given some stabilization I guess in the prices of oil and the currencies or such that you would manage those things less tightly in 2Q or how do you view that where we stand today? Nicholas Gangestad : In terms of managing our spending tightly, I don't see that changing as the year goes on, particularly in markets like West Europe and United States, some of our developed markets, where we're managing our spending pretty carefully right now. Inge Thulin : Yes, I would say that there will not be any change, as we move into Q2 relative to operation. The team here is on this big time. So there would no change short-term relative to what we need to do. And we had an aggressive plan for the year and we will do everything we can in order to make sure we deliver on that one. Shannon OCallaghan : And then just in terms of how the first quarter progressed, we're getting sort of different stories from different companies about how the year kind of started and exited 1Q. Did you see any variation across the months of the quarter, either a slow start that improved or vice versa? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, that's something we're always looking at as if there is a change in trend. And as we look, as our revenue progressed through the quarter, we really did not see a meaningful trend one direction or the other throughout the quarter. They have one-off things occurring like when Chinese New Year is and when Easter is, when we adjust for those things, we really see no meaningful trend through the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So, Nick, just wanted to go back to the raw material commentary. I think you guided for $0.15, $0.25 benefit for the full year, back in December. And it looks like you have a $0.05 of benefit this quarter. So are we now looking at a situation where the raw material benefits are now above the $0.25, given your commentary that its more backend loaded in your plan? Nicholas Gangestad : So in December we laid out a range of $0.15 to $0.25 that we were expecting for raw material commodity price benefits. On January 27 in our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated that, say, we now see ourselves at the high-end at $0.25. And Nigel, what we have been seeing is this is playing out almost exactly as we've expected. From a commodity pricing, we see it fairly balanced throughout the year. The only nuance on that is that there is some inventory channel work through of using slightly more expensive inventory to our channel, which is what makes it just a little bit less in the first quarter. But that's all progressing right to our $0.25 that I stated back in January. Nigel Coe : And my math on benefits, on the 50 bps of benefits above $0.05, is that about right for the quarter? Nicholas Gangestad : 50 bps would be about approaching -- Matt Ginter : I think it's about $0.04, Nigel. We'll get back to you. Nigel Coe : And then secondly on the margin bridge, I just want to understand the mutual impact of FX, because we've seen that the hedge gains would have been a net benefit to margins. So I just want to understand why that's flat? And if possible, if you could call out, how much of the gain came through in 1Q? Nicholas Gangestad : There is a couple of different forces their Nigel that in this quarter netted out to no change to the margin. There was the hedging gain, which is an absolute upside benefit to the margin. But that's offset by a differential to the margin, where we source things to the extent to which our international companies source product from a U.S. dollar currency. That has a negative impact on margins. Those two things offset each other in the first quarter of 2015. As we look out over the remaining three quarters of the year that will likely become slightly accretive to our margin. Very similar to what we saw in second quarter and then a little more accretive in third and fourth quarter. Nigel Coe : Any ways you could quantify that mix? Nicholas Gangestad : Excuse me, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Any way you can quantify that benefit? Nicholas Gangestad : When I'm saying -- I am talking small, like 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. Just to put out a range on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Robert McCarthy : Just one quick question on, just any update on what you're seeing with ERP and the traction in terms of your investments? Inge Thulin : It's going well. As you know, we are sort of updated you in December and even after that. We are rolling out as we speak now in Europe, in West Europe specifically, and the next place to go live is in Nordic. And we are rolling that out according to plan. And as you know, we went from go, when we tested it country-by-country, now to go regional and we go in West Europe first. And I think it's the first week of the -- or we go in July, second week in July, is when we will roll out in Nordic next. So everything is on plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : On the hedging dynamics, I guess you can kind of do the math on that, I'm not sure whether it's in the 10-K or not or the 10-Q. But are you looking at for '16, if you know the euro stays where it is today. Is there an impact there or do you go all the way out through '16? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Steve, we are hedged out through '16 and in fact a little into '17. And just to put the numbers on it for 2015 versus 2016, we're estimating approximately $175 million of hedged gains to our P&L in 2015. And if everything stayed right where it is, that would be followed by $110 million of hedge gains in 2016. Steve Tusa : Has anything changed with regards to how the four-Xs dropping through, exclusive of the hedges? I think Danaher today talked about a higher margin on there drop through. Matt Ginter : I guess what I'd say, Steve, is back to the couple of questions ago, the one we're hedging and the dollar is strong, net-net it should be slightly positive to margins, as Nick just alluded to, and that is our expectation for the year. So when we calculate that, when we calculate the impact, we take our numbers and pull out the sales impact from FX and the bottomline impact from FX, recount the margin; and if you're hedging, by definition, your margin should go up slightly. Steve Tusa : So one last question just on, so basically similar growth in the second quarter to the first quarter. Should we be, say -- I mean can growth get to in this kind of economy, this kind of outlook. Can growth get to like above 6% in the second half? I mean is that should we thinking about high end of the range type of growth in the second half of the year, I mean can it accelerate that much? Inge Thulin : Well, we do not change our guidance for the year at this point in time. So you have 3% to 6%. So I think you're describing correct. As I said earlier, think about it very similar to Q2 as Q1, and then we will see an acceleration in the last part of the year, second half. And then I would not predict at this point in time how high it will go, all right, because we are not immune to the economical environment and how that will accelerate. But our performance of 1.5x to 1.7x IPI is steady, as I said historically, when I look at on those six months periods, as you and I have talked about earlier, so I'm optimistic 3% to 6% for the year. Steve Tusa : And then just one last question. Are you guys seeing any impact from competitors, global competitors, given the foreign exchange movements? I think of your products is pretty defendable with good modes, but anybody getting regressive out there on price? Inge Thulin : Well, we have all type of competitors, right. We have global competitors. We have regional competitors. We have local competitors. So we are working with this the whole time. And I would say, as Nick said earlier, up to this point in time we have not seen any change in the behaviors versus what we see the whole time when we do business on the day-to-day basis, so answer to that no. But of course, we have competitors, right. And they are everywhere and they are very attractive, of course, to come into spaces where we are, because nice growth and nice good margin, but we have not seen any change in their behaviors up to this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Just a couple, really quick one. Just back on FX, I would imagine those hedges are in a handful of major currencies. My question is if you -- maybe that's right or wrong, but the larger question is if you think about that $110 million hedge gain that you have for 2016, does that fully cover kind of the topline driven FX headwind you would expect in '16, if we just run through at these rates for the rest of this year and into next year. Nicholas Gangestad : Jeff, couple of questions there to go through. One is it's largely in developed markets and those currencies that we're able to cost effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging. Other currencies such as Brazilian real, that's less cost effective for us to hedge in and in markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges, meaning how much do we source locally, our ability price to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets. To your question on does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016, no it doesn't. It's never our intense with our hedging strategy, our financial hedging strategy to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize reduce volatility and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of the volatility off the table. Jeff Sprague : And I'm just wondering on strategic investments, is there any change in tempo over the course of the remainder of the year? Inge Thulin : No, there's not. I mean, we are working our plan and we're couple our years into it, as you know. So there's no change in the tempo relative to our ERP program or investment in recession development and what we call I3 or any small restructure as we do in here or there when we have the opportunity to do it. So the plan from that perspective is working and it's working well for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Two quick ones. Can you characterize how you see the setup for the year in European auto? Some companies have talked about that as being most likely area for Korean [ph] chute in terms of domestic activity. And secondly are there any regions or end-markets where as you look at the sequential trends into March and April, the deceleration was sharply worse than you expected? Inge Thulin : Well, on the European front, first of all, our automotive business globally is doing very well. I mean we have 9% growth in the quarter versus 1% growth in the auto build. So again, we are doing very, very well. And that's a global business, so we do well with all the global players. Relative to Europe, we have good penetration on design and spec-in there, as all other places. And you could assume that, who knows that in the later part of the year the export generally speaking for West Europe will improve, due to the dollar versus euro and other currency. And by then by definition automotive will capitalized from that as well. So assuming that that is correct, as everyone talk about, then there will be a improved export from Europe generally speaking. Automotive by definition is a big engine for growth in West Europe as we all know. Now, many of the automotive makers here designing and spec-in on certain places and they could use it to other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing. To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was any change with more than, which is a small piece is Middle East/Africa. Middle East/Africa, as we all know and understand due to geopolitical issues face challenges, so I would say that was not in March. I think that was for the whole first quarter was total different environment to do business. And so I think that's the only place that we could see any change in trends, right. So that's understandable in way and you we have to manage it through the situation. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. End of Q&A Matt Ginter : This is Matt. It's obviously a very busy earnings day, so we really do appreciate you spending the hour with us. Thank you very much. We look forward to speaking to you very soon. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the 3M second-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 23, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matt Ginter : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next investor meeting scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our investor relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide three and I will hand off to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio. Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers. Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex-electronic basis growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1, and I will talk more about our electronics business shortly. Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our five business groups grew organically, led by safety and graphics at 5%, followed by consumer and healthcare businesses at 3%. Growth in industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general in the industrial markets. Electronics and energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition we increased margins in electronics and energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter. As you recall, last year we consolidated a number of businesses within electronics and energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I am pleased with the progress of this business and going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technology's capabilities. In the second quarter we saw continued strength of the US dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide. Our margins remain strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%. This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model, and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And just last month we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we have taken to strengthen our portfolio. Please turn to slide number four. Portfolio management is one of our three strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy. Back in 2012 we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value, such as combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity, acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives, and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strengths or objectives. In the first half of 2015 we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined two of our healthcare businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, were merged to form a single Oral Care Solutions business. Now, through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency. In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from six business groups to five and from 40 businesses to 26. Next, our acquisitions. Earlier I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's separations media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our healthcare business group. At the same time in January, we sold our static control business after thorough strategic review. Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers and ultimately for our shareholders today, and even more so in the future. Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide five were I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%. The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the static control business. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the US dollar by 20%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014. On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. US growth was broad based, led by safety and graphics and consumer at 6%, healthcare at 4% and industrial at 3%. Latin America/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our healthcare and industrial businesses, while safety and graphics and electronics and energy both declined organically. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us starting in Q3. Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with healthcare and safety and graphics each growing 9% and consumer growing 3%. Electronics and energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific. Organic growth was down 2% in China/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Healthcare delivered strong growth which was offset by declines in safety and graphics, electronics and energy, and consumer. We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China/Hong Kong to be in the mid single-digit range versus mid-to-high single-digits previously. Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2%, or up 7% excluding electronics. Health care and safety and graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our consumer and industrial businesses. Turning to EMEA, organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central East Europe increased high single-digits while Middle East/Africa was down mid single-digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by safety and graphics at 4%, health care was flat and industrial, consumer and electronics and energy each declined 1%. Please turn to slide six for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance. Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin. On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations. We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remain favorable and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remains strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments. Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate. For the full year we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. Let\u2019s now turn to slide seven for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year\u2019s comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year\u2019s Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 3% versus last year\u2019s second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share. Let\u2019s now review cash flow, please turn to slide number eight. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Second-quarter free cash flow was $1.0 billion and we converted 74% of net income to cash. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full-year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion. Let\u2019s now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our industrial business. Please turn to slide number nine. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by 3M Purification and aerospace and commercial transportation each generating double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive OEM business posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat. On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America/Canada set the pace, with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%. The industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price/raw materials. Let\u2019s now turn to safety and graphics on slide ten. Second quarter sales in safety and graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of 3M\u2019s heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets. As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further. Geographically, organic sales growth in safety and graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 2%. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions. Let\u2019s now turn to health care. Please turn to slide 11. Health care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, with organic growth of 3.4%. We continued to see broad-based organic growth across much of the health care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to health care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in health care was led by Asia Pacific at 9%, with strong contributions from both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Latin America/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4% and EMEA was flat. Health care\u2019s operating income was $440 million and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price/raw material benefits. Next we will look at Electronics and Energy on slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2% and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance. Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronics side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs. In our energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales were down 3, consistent with first quarter growth patterns. On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4% and Latin America/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter. Please turn to slide 13. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio, with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of Scotch Blue painter\u2019s tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter. Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items. Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America/Canada was flat and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs.  That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. Overall, 3M delivered a good second quarter performance. Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M\u2019s entire team, I am very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economic environment, which is evident in our strong productivity. Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty to remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4%, versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8.00, versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place. As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%. And we continue to expect a free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%. Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investment for the future and managing those things within our control, in other words, controlling the controllable. As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong, and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M\u2019s four fundamental strengths : technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our Company, and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth into future. Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Inge, maybe just touching on organic growth for a second, you're tracking towards the lower end of the full-year guide so far year-to-date, and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the environment. And so I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about your base case for the rest of the year just given what you are seeing geographically and across your product portfolio? Inge Thulin : Well, as you recall, we saw -- all of us saw a slow economic environment coming early in the year. And after the first quarter we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think it now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it is the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And now you can see basically the Industrial Production Index came down even a couple of weeks ago from 2.6 to 2.1. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it\u2019s prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4%. This is what we had earlier.  I would say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the electronics. Electronics was two things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago, and then there became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right. And so I think that the 2.5% to 4%, I think that\u2019s a reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up there on the electronics business. Typically there is -- you see some type of seasonal uptick in the second quarter, particularly from a margin standpoint. I think very few years have you seen a sequential decline in margins on electronics. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding on what's driving the weakness. How are utilization rates? How do you view the channel from an inventory standpoint? And then how should we think about that margin trajectory moving forward? Nick Gangestad : Joe, this is Nick. The margin -- we expanded margin here 60 basis points year-on-year against a quarter that was fairly strong, second quarter of last year. What's been enhancing our margin and will continue to enhance our margin is some of the portfolio management actions that we've been taking in that business that increase our cost competitiveness. That's what's been driving it in the last few quarters and we continue to see that driving it in the next few quarters, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And then I guess just a commentary on the end market from a utilization standpoint and from an inventory standpoint, what\u2019s your sense for what's happening in the channel today? Inge Thulin : Well, I don\u2019t say \u2013 I think it\u2019s more -- as you know, we are spec-in on most of the devices in the industry and what is happening from time-to-time is maybe a little bit of a delay of the new product introduction, and that will of course then impact us immediately. So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in the past relative to our spec-in. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then also can see relative to purchasing. So if there was a little bit of a delay of some new product introductions and they didn\u2019t build inventory, they type of slowed it down and that is impacting us as well.  I will make the comment, though, on that business, if we just put it in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8% or something, and now moved it up to 21%. And the question was always, is this volume driven? And my answer was always no. The action we have taken on the portfolio, in order to get more efficient organization, better lines to customers and have better asset utilization, meaning if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business, a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume related. I think we proved that \u2013 in this quarter, we proved that model is correct. So Volume went down a little bit, and in fact we had margin expansion in that business. For that and on the work we have done on our portfolio, I'm personally very pleased with what that team had done relative to that portfolio work. Joe Ritchie : That's a fair point. Thanks for that. Thanks, Inge and Nick. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks and good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Hi, good morning Nigel. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Nigel Coe : I think if we back out electronics and energy, which is a bit more \u2013 a little bit choppier around the quarters, I think the growth is the lowest we've seen since the recovery. So I'm just wondering, maybe just Inge, maybe just some commentary on the macro environment. Do you view this as a speed bump and can we get beyond this back into that 4% or 5% zone or do you think there's something a bit more awry here? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all, I think let's hold it to the year, where we start talking to 2.5% to 4%, so we don't go ahead of on this ourselves relative to the future. But I think when I look upon it is to say first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago that growth was slightly lower and the question was then, are you concerned about the US? Our answer was no, not necessarily. And I think we had 4% growth here. That's good. In Asia, or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding electronics, which is the base business, 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down. They're type of adjusting to a new growth level there and we are now talking about mid-to-single \u2013 mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that the growth need to pick up more, specifically in the domestic markets, and health care did well for us there. The other businesses went basically sideways. West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pick-up based on the euro situation. So far we have not seen that, and probably will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year.  Latin America is doing fine. And as you see again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now is the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison where we will go into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it. So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year. Then we will have to see how Q3 and Q4 will work out here. Nigel Coe : Okay, and perhaps -- Inge, thanks for that commentary. You mentioned let's see how 3Q looks. You gave some good color on the last call on 2Q trends to date, which turned out to be pretty prescient. Inge Thulin : Can you repeat that, which one? Nigel Coe : I'm just wondering how is 3Q tracking? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, we're not really seeing any change in trends from what we saw in Q2. We saw things pretty stable within Q2 and we're not seeing, so far in the third quarter, any change in that pattern. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's very helpful. And just a quick one on health care. You mentioned drug delivery as being part of base and being weak, and that was a factor last quarter. If we back out the impacts of drug delivery, how does that look? How does health care look ex that? Nick Gangestad : That business in total, Nigel, brought down the growth for health care by approximately 1 percentage point. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jermaine Brown : Thank you, good morning. Inge Thulin : Hi, David. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Jermaine Brown : This is actually Jermaine Brown filling in for David. Inge Thulin : Okay, well, good morning to you. Jermaine Brown : Two questions. Good morning. Your gross margins in Q2 expanded only slightly more than Q1. For H2, should we expect a greater raw material benefit? Or is Q1 and Q2 a good guide for what we should expect for margins within the second half? Nick Gangestad : We see the raw material benefits being pretty evenly spread between first half and second half. I would say the first half is a very good guide for the second half. Jermaine Brown : Understood. And my second question is, your demand within Asia-Pacific, particularly China, decelerated. I'd imagine that some of that was due to lower electronics demand. But were there any other businesses or end markets that also contributed to that decline? Nick Gangestad : Our declines there, we were up in our health care business. Electronics and energy was, yes of course, one of the declines. The others in China/Hong Kong were a deceleration from the growth we saw in the first quarter. Jermaine Brown : Okay. And then one month into Q3, what are you seeing demand-wise within Asia-Pacific? Nick Gangestad : As I said earlier, what we're seeing in Q3, so far no change in trajectory from what we saw in the second quarter or for the first half. Jermaine Brown : Understood. I will hop back in queue. That's all that I have. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Steven. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Steven Winoker : Could you talk a little bit about -- I want to dive into Capital Safety a little bit since I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do much of that. You talked about, in the release, 14 times EBITDA multiple, I think that included synergies. It's clearly a very -- at least I think it's a very attractive company and segment. But maybe talk through, number one, what was that multiple excluding that impact in that one-year timeframe? And how do you think about pricing in general, given that you're obviously allocating more funds to bigger M&A? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you thought about the return profile on that one and in general. Inge Thulin : First of all, the Capital Safety is in our view, a perfect fit for 3M. Fall protection, which is the segment, is among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the PP industry. And Capital Safety is recognized as a leader in fall protection. So you take those things together, there is high complementary synergy to 3M's global business in personal safety, which is a heartland division.  So Capital Safety, if think about it, it provides accretive growth to us and also margins, both for safety and graphics and for overall 3M. And you saw the start again for safety and graphics which is very, very good, and have as I said earlier, is the business group that I thought will have the real break-out as we go. So I think it is a very valued and good acquisition to us.  The component annual sales growth had been over 10% for the four last years and EBITDA margins is approaching 40%. You have all those type of things that you lay them back to the portfolio work we did where you say, well you know \u2013 well, how can we build out our businesses and make sure that we get more relevance with our customers as we move ahead and drive synergies?  So what I think about it in totality, and the figures you are quoting there is correct, is actually 12x based on five-year run rate synergies. But I think this is for us a terrific acquisition that is building out our position. Steven Winoker : Okay. And so do you think about it in terms of return on capital over that timeframe as well? Nick Gangestad : Certainly, Steve. We're looking at return on capital and looking at the time it takes us to bring this back to a return on capital. And for us that's in the fifth or sixth year that we see this meeting, on a cash basis, our return on capital -- our cost of capital. Steven Winoker : Okay, all right. And then just on the pricing versus raws, you already talked about the raws comment. Pricing was another 1% again this quarter, very strong, obviously dealing with FX and issues. Can we talk about the sustainability of pricing within that equation going forward? Nick Gangestad : On the margin front, just to clarify, of that 150 basis points about 60 of those basis points are coming from our price growth, and 90 basis points from our raw material reductions. As far as the sustainability of price, we're at about 1% price -- we are at a 1% price increase on average through the first half of the year. We see that trend sustaining through the second half of the year. Steven Winoker : Okay. And is that mostly just again, that's independent of new products. It's just pure price increases on the existing portfolio? Nick Gangestad : On our existing portfolio. I would add the color that if you look at all of our price growth, the fact that we keep refreshing our product line with our investments that we're making in research and development, that does enable us through the value we are creating for our customers, to be able to sustain pricing growth. But the other part of our price growth in the second quarter and for the year is also driven by movements related to FX. If I look at second-quarter standalone, of our total price growth, we estimate 25% of that total price growth is coming from pricing based on the value we are creating for our customers, and 75% based on movements we're taking directly or indirectly related to FX movements. Steven Winoker : Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. I was a little bit surprised in Capital Safety you said year five or six reach your cost to capital. And I'm assuming your -- I mean, I'll ask the question what you think your cost of capital is, but let's just say for the sake of argument it's somewhere in the 9% range. I would think when you're buying a business like this in an industry you know so well and so easily integratable, that you'd be able to earn a higher return on that. On the other side of it just indicates that maybe you overpaid. I hate to be skeptical on that stuff, but can you address it a bit? Nick Gangestad : Part of our portfolio prioritization is we know the assets we want to buy. We know where we can drive the most value. As we look at this business integrated with our personal safety business, we do see cost synergies that we'll be deriving. We see sales synergies, both of those contributing to get that result. What you're seeing here, Scott, is a result of us having a clear vision of what we wanted to add to our portfolio, and also an asset that we could see bringing a good financial return to 3M. Scott Davis : I think that partially answers it. Partially what I'm saying is, if you look at future acquisitions, is this going to be the type of hurdle rate you're looking for going forward? Because from my perspective, you would probably, is all you can do is earn 8% or 9% return five years out and there's risk, you could probably get that just buying your own stock. Inge Thulin : The answer to that is, is not necessarily, Scott. I think you have to look upon this -- first look upon this acquisition first of all, clearly strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's, I think that's an important element. There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated and where we can drive synergy, others cannot. The reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right. So there is two elements into it, right. Some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. And the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster. It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to enter is very high. So you have to think about it, you get it integrated and as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy. But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case. This is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here, and it's a high-class asset. It is a high-class asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can always -- Scott Davis : I agree. I think more specifically, just trying to get a sense of the future. Inge Thulin : The other thing here, Scott, if you look upon the other acquisitions we have done from Sumitomo to Ceradyne, et cetera, we are not even close to this, right. I will say that, we can always argue day out and day in of the valuation. Did you pay too much or whatever? This is a strategic fantastic move for us with a world-class asset. So I'm pleased with that piece and now it is up to us to drive the return even faster back to us. Scott Davis : Okay, that's a good answer. Just to be a little bit more, dig into a little bit more detail on that, you mentioned EBITDA margin of 40% on Capital Safety. Is that something -- can that be a 50% EBIDTA margin business or is it more a function you can bring Capital Safety in and the rest of your safety products businesses to co-opt? Or is it Capital Safety itself can see a margin lift? Nick Gangestad : Scott, we see modest gross margin expansion opportunities there. We probably see more of our cost synergy benefits coming from the back office SG&A front than on the gross margin front. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. So thanks, guys, I will pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC, please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning, everyone, and let me say congrats to Matt and Bruce on their new responsibilities. Sorry to pile on the Capital Safety deal, but this was the largest deal you have ever done. And if I'm not mistaken, this was not the first time you had the opportunity to buy this asset. Why did you pass on it before? And then you are already in fall protection because I've been to trade shows where we've had demonstrations of fall protection. So how does Capital Safety expand your product line and where might there be overlaps? Inge Thulin : You're right, Deane, that we had a small presence in that segment. We were very, very small. And one thing that I've learned over the years I've done business, if you do not have a reasonable good market share position, you will over time lose out. I've been in businesses over time where you think that a couple of percentage market share will take you to a better position. Is a very, very tough, so you need to come into a leading position. So that was one. So yes, we were there. We were, in my view, not relevant enough for the industry. So very opportunistic. Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about it in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is an important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you would like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that are becoming available. If you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I would say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset. But maybe at that point in time it was not clear enough relative to the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time, it was very, very clear for me where we should go. That's the answer from me. Deane Dray : Inge, thanks for that context. Just one follow-up on the Mexico organic revenue growth, 17% really jumps out. What was driving that and expectations for the balance of the year? Inge Thulin : Mexico has now been growing for almost two years, right, doing very, very well. And its -- I would say a combination of both domestic market growing well there, but also the overall Mexican economy in terms of exports, specifically into the United States. And we have a very good portfolio balance in Mexico. As you know, we've been there for a long time and we're able to capitalize on that. So I don't know exactly if I can give you the -- No, no, but his question is about the outlook for the year in Mexico. I think our growth rate here today is around 15% and I don't expect for the rest of the year that would slow down. But all businesses doing well there and specifically industrial is growing very, very fast. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning guys. On this China expectation for the year up mid-single digits, China/Hong Kong, it was up 7% in the first, down 2% in the second. What gets better from here to even get you to the mid-single digits? I mean, you talked about some inventory channel adjustments, maybe just any other color on what you expect to improve from the current rate? Inge Thulin : I think that, first of all, I believe that health care will continue. He had a good quarter in health care. Health care will continue and consumer will improve specifically. I also think that the industrial business, that is a sizable business for us there will improve slightly as we go for the year. So when you think about our portfolio, we get industrial slightly better. We get consumer up a little bit, which we will. And then health care continuing. That will take us there. I don't comment on electronics because, as you know, electronics is that kind of business that is on a regional base. Sometimes Japan is doing better than China and so forth, right. So, let's see how much that will be executed in China. But I think there's still a time here that we have to see the adjustment in the Chinese market. But those three businesses specifically will improve for us slightly as we go for the rest of the year. Shannon O'Callaghan: And in terms of those improvements in industrial and consumer, is that based on just sort of timing or ending of channel reductions? Or is this improvement in the economy? Inge Thulin : Yeah, yeah, now that is what we are counting on. We cannot count on anything else, right but that's what we are counting on. Shannon O'Callaghan: The channel being kind of cleared out and getting back to more normal? Inge Thulin : Yeah. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, and then within the industrial business, I mean, all the end markets you commented on sounded reasonably good, but the whole segment grew 1.4%. Was there anything within that segment that was dragging it down from the decent trends in auto and other stuff? Nick Gangestad : Yes, our industrial adhesives and tape business within industrial, that's one of the businesses that was flat. And that contributed to bringing the total organic growth down. Abrasives is another business that was down. Shannon O'Callaghan: And that was I mean going to a ton of different end markets [indiscernible] one thing, right? Nick Gangestad : Exactly. Including, in the case of abrasives, there's some oil and gas exposure there. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys, good morning. Just to clarify on the Safety acquisition, you said it's going to be dilutive in the first 12 months. When are we expecting to close it? In the third quarter, right? Is that dilution incorporated in the updated guidance? Nick Gangestad : Andrew, yeah, we've said that for the first 12 months, we expect this to be dilutive to GAAP EPS by $0.04. We expect this to close in the third quarter, in the middle of the third quarter, and our guidance is not yet including the impact of either the Capital Safety or the completion of the Polypore acquisition. Andrew Obin : And just to clarify, in terms of -- oil prices have been coming down quite a bit since the end of the quarter. And I know you've updated what you think the impact is going to be in terms of your inputs. But when did you update your outlook for oil prices? Is it updated for the decline that we've seen over the past several weeks? Nick Gangestad : Yeah, it is updated. And similar to what I said in April where we see ourselves now at the high end of the range of $0.25 benefit on raw materials, benefits as well as the margin impact I talked about earlier, that's reflecting where we are the most recently with commodity prices. So yes, it is reflecting that, Andrew. Andrew Obin : And just a broader question. All of a sudden North America, US is the fastest growing market, right, it has lower margins, emerging markets are slowing. Are you guys thinking about adjusting your longer-term plan, given where the macro is playing out? Or do you think the existing game plan is adaptable to what you're seeing? Inge Thulin : Yeah, the existing game plan is adaptable to what we are seeing. There's no change from that thinking at that point in time. And as you know, if you think about the five-year plan, we are three years into it. And there's always some changes going in and out in the plan, right, in terms of all metrics. But at this point in time -- of course from an execution perspective on where you invest for manufacturing and so forth, there are some differences now versus when they were three years ago, or where will you invest in international, right, or will you do it in the United States. So I think that's a business call on a day-to-day business. But at this point in time, there's no change from the overall plan, and our play-book is working. Our play-book is working. Andrew Obin : Terrific, thank you very much. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Nick Gangestad : Hey, good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So I guess just back to Shannon's question, but at a little more of a broad sense. Can you give us a little color on what you would expect on a core basis for kind of how the third and the fourth quarter play out? I know that you have a little bit of an easier comp in the third, and then a tougher comp in the fourth. I'm just kind of curious to see, to his question, just more broadly, what gets better here from the 1.8% that you put up this quarter? Nick Gangestad : Okay, Steve, just to clarify, you're talking total company? Steve Tusa : Total-co or core. So the 1.8%, what does the 1.8%, kind of how does that trend in the third and the fourth quarter? Is it steady or is it a little bit better in the third? Worse in the fourth? Nick Gangestad : In our 2.5% to 4%, I can't say we're seeing a noticeable difference between the third and fourth quarter, if you're looking for some color on that, Steve. On the low end of the range, it would be a continuation of the growth rate that we've seen in the first half, that continues into both the third and fourth quarter. If we're a shade towards the middle or the high end of the range, we would expect to start to see that occurring in the third quarter and not all in the fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And did things get -- how did things trend as you kind of went around the quarter? How was kind of April, May, June type of dynamics? Nick Gangestad : When we look on this on a sales per billing day, we saw virtually no change in our trends between the three months of the second quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last question just on the pricing dynamics. I guess you said 70% or 75% of that are kind of forex related. So I mean as we kind of lap these for-ex comps I guess as we move into next year, I guess you're going to have a first-quarter comp. So does that mean that 1% is probably -- since your second half is probably going to be a little bit less than 7% year-over-year, I guess, on forex? Does that mean that 1% kind of starts to fade in total as we move forward? Nick Gangestad : To the extent that there's a portion of that 1% related to FX, over time, I see that fading, but not in the second half of the year. If it does fade, it will be minimal. The logical extension is we see some fading of that in '16, not a material amount of fading in the second half of 2015. Steve Tusa : And on the 0.2% in US, so is that a good kind of reflection on, I guess, the US is probably your most stable market. Is that a good reflection of kind of what you're seeing on the price inflation side? Presumably customers will come back seeing what you guys are doing on the raws side. I mean, is it a little bit tougher to get price these days because of what's going on with raw materials? This is more of a kind of macro question, I guess, as well. Inge Thulin : Well, you would assume it would be, but I think one of the advantages for us is that often our product is adding some additional profitability and productivity to our customers. So I would say, yes, a little bit tougher. But as long as you are focused on new product that's adding value into the end market, you are able to demand a slightly higher price. Steve Tusa : Right, great, thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : I just want to follow up on the industrial business. You talked about some inventory issues there in the second quarter. I just wondered how severe those were and if you thought that that inventory had largely been cleared out, so in the third quarter we should see a better industrial organic growth rate. Inge Thulin : Yeah. I would say that I think it will be cleared out, early Q3 is my view. Right. And I think when you listen to the results for the industrial and many businesses did well. There's a capital business that I will describe more as they're not spec-in, right or designing, they're more in the consumable side like abrasives and tape and so forth. That's where we had a little bit of temper and I think that then holding to the channels. But I'm more optimistic as we move forward relative to that front for industrial. The other businesses there, if you think about aerospace and commercial and transportation at another 10% growth, purification another 10%, automotive OEM, as Nick said, has 6%. So many businesses there are doing very well. There were two divisions that had an impact for the quarter and it was very much what I would describe as consumables into industrial tapes and adhesives and abrasives. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the free cash conversion. Is it just the tax normalization in the second half that pushes up the conversion? Or is there something else happening with working capital, for example? Nick Gangestad : Julian, there's a few things at play here. First of all, when we pay our cash taxes, there is some timing, and second quarter happened to be heavier weighted. That will moderate for the total year. Second quarter was also a quarter of higher than normal amount of our total pension contribution occurring in the second quarter. And then the last piece is we did see some increases in our working capital and we expect that also to moderate in the second half of the year, all of the three of those contributing to improvement in our working capital into the second half. Those are what I'd adjust for. We have normal adjustments where, for instance for compensation, that always has a noticeable improvement in our free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning, two quick ones. Inge Thulin : Hi, Laurence. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. As you look across your portfolio in terms of where you either have a stronger new product pipeline or a high degree of confidence about pent-up demand, do you see any line of sight for acceleration in 2016, 2017 in any of your larger product categories? And secondly, if this choppy, soft demand environment continues for a few more years, how does that effect, if at all, your balance sheet targets? Inge Thulin : Well, Nick will give you some comment on the balance sheet. Let me just comment relative to the, let's say, business groups. First of all, there is a very robust pipeline of new products in each individual business groups. So I don't see, from that perspective, a difference in between them. But when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- industrial is 33% of our portfolio, and very strong. And we are now adding, even, an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that what I call a design or spec-in there is a very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong. I think, as I said earlier, safety and graphics, I talked about that for over a year now, that I believe that safety and graphics is the next breakout business group for us, as electronics and energy came earlier. The margin has expanded quite a bit there and I predicted that safety and graphics will follow, and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that that will happen. And you see our health care business. Health care business is usually the fastest growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world, meaning only 20% in the developing, and that way a lot of growth for us is coming. And again, I would say, yes, when I look upon it and try to be objective, you see the performance of our consumer business. Again, with a very good growth I would say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I would say for the future for what we're doing here, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency and organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that the productivity is important and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So I would not make a distinction in between there. We are in a good position everywhere. Nick Gangestad : Laurence, just a follow-up close on the last piece, you were asking about the balance sheet. Our strategy with our balance sheet, as far as our capital structure and our allocation of capital, we see that our strategy there robust enough to encompass a number of business models, including a lower growth scenario. On the margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that more -- lower growth world. But for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building. In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities. It could have an impact where things become more attractive to us, but that's highly driven by the opportunities that we see presenting at that time. Matt Ginter : Laurence, this is Matt. We wouldn't see anything changing in terms of organic growth being the primary way in which we grow. We obviously dial CapEx to whatever levels of growth we're seeing, but it doesn't fundamentally change the way we think about growth, acquisition versus M&A. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answers portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments. Matt Ginter : Well, thank you very much for participating this morning. We look forward to seeing you very soon. Good-bye.",

Welcome to the 3M third quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 22, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matthew Ginter - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments today, and then we'll take your questions. Today's earnings release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please turn to slide two for a list of upcoming 3M investor events. On Tuesday, December 15, we will discuss our 2016 business outlook on a conference call beginning at 8 AM Central time. Please note we will not be hosting this year's outlook meeting in New York, as has been our practice in recent years. The conference call should last approximately 90 minutes, so please plan accordingly. Also, on March 29 of next year, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul. Lastly, note the dates for next year's earnings calls, which are scheduled for January 26, April 26, July 26, and October 25. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide three. During today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide four, and I will hand it off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. And as always, thank you for joining us. 3M delivered solid operational performance in the third quarter. In an external environment that had remained soft, our team posted strong earnings, organic growth in all geographic areas, and expanded margins. Equally important, we continue to make investments and take actions to build strengths on strengths and position 3M for long-term success. Let me first take you through the quarterly numbers. Earnings per share rose to $2.05, which is a 3.5% increase year over year. Companywide, we delivered organic local currency sales growth of 1%, with positive growth across all geographic areas. Four of our five business groups grew organically, paced by Consumer at 5% and Health Care at 4%. Acquisitions added one percentage to sales in the quarter, as we deployed capital to drive growth and strengthen the business. The strong U.S. dollar continued to impact our top line, reducing quarterly sales by more than 7%. Total sales in the quarter declined 5% to $7.7 billion. At the same time, we continued to generate strong productivity in the quarter by controlling those things within our control. As a result, operating margins were 24.3%, up nearly a full percentage point year on year. All five business groups delivered margins greater than 22%. In the quarter, 3M also returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now please turn to slide number five. At 3M, we always have one eye on the microscope and one eye on the telescope. The microscope view is about driving growth, productivity, and efficiency day to day, quarter to quarter, and year to year. The telescope view is about the long term and making sure we are investing in the future. The global economy continues to evolve, as do the needs for us and for our customers. 3M is evolving as well, building for a future that will be more competitive, more dynamic, and more challenging. We're doing that in large part through our three strategic levers, portfolio management, investing in innovation, and business transformation. Let me start by describing our efforts to strengthen and focus our portfolio and ongoing processes, an ongoing process we began in 2012. In the third quarter we closed two important acquisitions to both complement organic growth and enhance two of 3M's core platforms, Personal Safety and Filtration. The integration of those businesses is off to a good start. At the same time, earlier this month we announced the divestitures of our Library System business and our French license plate converting business, both within our Safety & Graphics business group. After extensive review, we concluded that these businesses were worth more to an outside owner versus remaining part of the 3M portfolio. Selling the businesses resulted in greatest value creating for the company and for the shareholders. Last month we also announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Health Information Systems business, which is an Industrial leader in healthcare coding software. Options include spinning off, selling, or keeping the business. Ultimately, we will choose the best path to benefit 3M, our stakeholders, and the business itself. The selection of a strategic direction is anticipated by the end of Q1 in 2016. In addition to portfolio investments in the quarter, we continued to invest in organic growth through research and development, in close partnership with our customers and the market. Technology conversion will remain a key driver for the global economy into the future, and our investments will strengthen 3M's scientific edge. And at our Investor Day in St. Paul next March, we look forward to taking you through our new state-of-the-art research laboratory. Finally, to make 3M more competitive, more productive, and more efficient, we are transforming our business processes. The backbone is a new global ERP system. As you recall, we are implementing this system on a regional basis, starting in Europe. 3M made good progress in the third quarter, including a successful deployment across the Nordic countries. Our team is focused on continuing to execute a rollup plan in West Europe, with the United States to follow. By 2020, our business transformation efforts will result in an estimated operational savings of $500 million to $700 million annually and a reduction in working capital of $0.5 billion. Beyond our three strategic levers, we are taking other steps to increase our competitiveness and strengthen 3M for the future. Today we announced a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction of 1,500 positions. The reduction will be preliminarily focused on structural overhead, launched in the United States along with slower growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe, Middle East-Africa, and Latin America. On a pre-tax basis, we will take a charge of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter related to this plan, with savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Each and every day as I look across our enterprise, I grow more confident in our future. We are taking action to build a stronger, more agile, and more focused company that will compete and win not just today but well into the future. Thank you, and now Nick will go through more details on the quarter. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six, where I will cover the elements of third quarter sales growth. Q3 organic growth was 1.2%, largely driven by higher selling prices. Volumes were up slightly in the quarter. All geographic areas posted positive organic growth in the quarter. In August we completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added one percentage point to sales growth in Q3. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.4 percentage points, with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen, and Brazilian real. These currencies devalued versus the U.S. dollar by 15%, 14%, and 37% respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.2% versus the third quarter of 2014. The United States delivered organic growth of 1.5%, led by Consumer, Health Care, and Safety & Graphics. Our U.S. Industrial business, which experienced softer end market conditions and a challenging year-on-year comparison, declined organically. Asia-Pacific organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter, where four of our five business groups posted positive growth. Organic growth was led by Health Care and Safety & Graphics, while Electronics & Energy declined year on year. Within Asia-Pacific, Japan increased 1% organically or 5% excluding Electronics. As you may recall, last fall we acquired the remaining 25% interest in our Sumitomo Japan subsidiary. The 3M Japan team continues to execute well and is delivering strong results in 2015. China-Hong Kong's organic growth was down 2% or up 3% excluding Electronics. Moving to EMEA, we saw organic growth of 1.5%, with West Europe flat, Central-East Europe up double digits, and Middle East-Africa down slightly. Finally, Latin America-Canada delivered organic growth of 2.3% versus last year's third quarter. Mexico continued its trend of strong double-digit organic growth, increasing 13%, while Brazil declined 2%. Please turn to slide seven for the third quarter P&L highlights. Companywide, third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.9 billion. Operating margins were 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points year on year. As you see on the right-hand side of the slide, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 170 basis points of margin expansion. Productivity added another 20 basis points to margins, as we continue to prioritize investments, benefit from past portfolio actions, and drive operational efficiencies through Lean Six Sigma. Foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains increased margins by 20 basis points. The impact from recent acquisitions reduced Q3 operating margins by 60 basis points, as we began to absorb purchase accounting adjustments and work through integration plans for Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business. Strategic investments reduced margins by 10 basis points. Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced third quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. Through nine months we have increased total company operating margins by one percentage point to 23.7%. Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.05 per share, an increase of 3.5% year on year. The combination of organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.11 to our earnings growth this quarter. These results include a negative $0.04 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense. Our third quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 30.3% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year over year, which added $0.08 to third quarter earnings per share. The acquisitions of Polypore's Separations Media business and Capital Safety reduced earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarter due to purchase accounting adjustments and one-time expenses and integration costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect $0.02 per share of additional dilution from these transactions. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by approximately $95 million, or the equivalent of $0.10 per share. For the full year, we expect foreign currency impacts to reduce earnings by approximately $0.40 per share. Let's now review cash flow performance on slide nine. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, down slightly from last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $354 million, in line year on year. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and converted 101% of net income to cash. Free cash flow conversion for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of 95% to 100% versus 90% to 100% previously. As a reminder, our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion is typically the strongest of the year. We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter, an increase of $369 million year on year. Cash dividends were $635 million, and gross share repurchases were $1.5 billion. For the full year, gross repurchases are now forecasted to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion versus a prior expectation of $4 billion to $5 billion. Now let's review our business group performance, starting on slide 10. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, up slightly organically. Our Automotive OEM business grew mid-single digits, as we continue to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business consistently grows faster than the rate of global car and light truck production levels. 3M Purification, Abrasives, and Industrial Adhesives & Tapes also posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Our Advanced Materials business declined, primarily due to weakness in the oil and gas market. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business added 70 basis points to Industrial sales growth in the third quarter. On a geographic basis, Industrial's growth was positive in Latin America-Canada, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, while declining in the U.S. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $580 million in the quarter. And operating margins were 22.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, or up 90 basis points excluding the Polypore Separations Media acquisition. Let's now turn to Safety & Graphics on slide 11. Sales in Safety & Graphics increased 2.9% organically to $1.4 billion. Organic sales growth was strong across much of the portfolio, including Commercial Solutions and our Heartland Personal Safety business. The Roofing Granules business posted double-digit organic growth in Q3, while Traffic Safety and Security Systems declined year on year. Complementing Safety & Graphics organic growth was the acquisition of Capital Safety, which add 4.2% to sales in the third quarter. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and the U.S., while Latin America-Canada declined. Operating income was $324 million, and operating margins declined 0.6 percentage points to 22.9%. Excluding the Capital Safety acquisition, margins rose 1.3 percentage points to 24.8%. Please turn to slide 12. The Health Care business generated third quarter sales of $1.3 billion, with organic growth of 3.7%. Our Medical Consumables businesses, namely Infection Prevention and Critical & Chronic Care along with our Oral Care business, were up mid-single digits year on year. Together these businesses represent three-quarters of our Health Care business. Health Information Systems and Food Safety enjoyed double-digit growth in Q3. Drug Delivery declined organically, as its challenging year-on-year comparisons continued into the third quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to quarterly growth. Integration of this business is going well, and it is exceeding sales and profit objectives. Our Health Care business grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Latin America-Canada, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. The business continues to drive penetration in developing markets, with 10% organic growth in the quarter. Countries with notable strength included Taiwan, China-Hong Kong, India, and Mexico, all up double digits. Health Care's operating income was $432 million with margins of 32.1%, up 110 basis points year over year. Next, let's cover the third quarter performance of Electronics & Energy. Please turn to slide 13. Sales for this business were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 2.8% organically, while operating income increased slightly to $342 million. Portfolio management actions, raw material benefits, and the team's relentless focus on operational excellence drove a 240 basis point improvement in operating margins to 24.9%. Organic sales declined 3% on the Electronics side of the business, with Electronics Materials Solutions up slightly and Display Materials and systems declining. In our Energy-related businesses, organic sales were down 2%, similar to past quarters, with growth in telecom more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth increased in EMEA, while the U.S., Latin America-Canada, and Asia-Pacific all declined. Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion, with organic growth of 5%. Organic growth was led by our Stationery & Office Supplies business, with strong back-to-school sales in Scotch home and office tapes, Post-it, and Command products. In the home improvement business, our Filtrete brand filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home, also helped propel growth in the quarter. Our Home Care business also delivered positive organic growth while Consumer Health Care declined slightly. Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S., Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, while Latin America-Canada declined. Operating income increased to $293 million, and margins were 25.2%, up two percentage points year over year. That wraps up our review of the third quarter business results. Please turn to slide 15, where Inge will provide an update on our 2015 planning estimates. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Nick. As we all know, the current economic growth environment remains challenging. Against that backdrop, today we are updating our full-year outlook for 2015. We now expect organic growth of 1.5% to 2% versus prior guidance of 2.5% to 4%. Foreign currency translation will reduce sales by approximately 7% compared with a prior range of 6% to 7%. Excluding the impact of restructuring, we expect full-year earnings per share in the range of $7.73 to $7.78. We previously expected EPS in the range of $7.73 to $7.93. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.65, which reflects the expected $0.13 restructuring charge in Q4. We also now anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 100%, up from the prior range of 90% to 100%. So thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, Inge and Nick. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Scott. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think a lot of us are trying figure out what \u2013 more macro I guess than 3M specific, but this is the second quarter in a row where you've taken down your top line core guidance. I'm trying to get a sense of how much of the decline you guys think might be related to inventory destock versus actual sell-through, and maybe just the state of where you think inventories are right now because clearly folks are a little bit more cautious. So you can see it would be logical that folks would be decreasing inventories right now, I suppose, right? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's a combination, Scott. I think first of all when you look upon the decline in terms of IPI [Industrial Production Index] growth, we have all seen that going down quarter by quarter during the year. And that is related both to United States and to China and Germany, you can say basically on a global base. I think that is one impact. And then, of course, enterprises around the world look upon the balance sheet and the cash flow and type of work down there, the inventory as well. So I will say when we look upon our performance in terms of growth, yes, it slowed during the year, but we don't believe and we know that we are not losing out in terms of penetration or market share. But I think it's a combination of both of them. So we clearly see \u2013 we're ending out the year I will say at the lower global growth rate in the economy versus what all of us anticipated as we went into the year. And when I look upon that, I feel personally very good of how we as a team, and I'm talking now about all the 90,000 at 3M, have been able to manage that through and improve most of the metrics when it became more of a challenge for us to grow. But we are growing. We are growing and we have margin expansion and very good cash flow. But also your question, I think it's combination of both. And I think people would like to look out a couple of years now, what will this mean? And I think everything you see that we have been doing this year in terms of our portfolio work and our investment in R&D and the business transformation in addition to the announcement today of the restructuring is for us to be prepared as we move ahead in order for us to give good return despite maybe something that would be difficult for us to control, which is the growth in IPI and GDP. So I hope that helps. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It does, so help us understand. How do you plan for this type of an emerging market slowdown that we've seen? Really the last time we had a major EM dislocation was in the 1990s. It was a long time ago. And it's impossible to hedge the local currencies. It's tough to raise prices when you have \u2013 when you're trying to raise prices in an economy and a recession. And then at the same time, some of these countries like Brazil are hard to restructure. It's not easy to fire people there either. How do you plan for it, and how do you change? Do you just keep moving forward like you always have, or do you start to think in terms of taking real fixed assets out and disinvesting in some of these areas? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You just not continue as you have done in the past, of course, because the landscape has changed and then you have to, as I always say, if you go out in a forest and you go out with your map, and the map in the forest doesn't connect any longer, the forest is always right. So you cannot continue with your map if you think about that as a business plan. So we are doing that. When I look back over the years here, it's not something that we react to just today based on a quarter that is softer in one way or another. If you go back to China, for instance, we have not added people there for 12 to 18 months. We didn't reduce by definition, but we adjusted and slowed down the way we added people. Brazil today, you are correct. Brazil today will still, in my view and I think in most of our views, be a challenge maybe for the next two years. And you can see also in the restructuring announcement today, we're talking about Latin America as primary focus. And inside of that is, of course, Brazil. So what you have to do is to surgically go in and address it. And I think that's serving us well with a model we have is very much around localization, meaning we have a managing director in each country that is leading the operation, and there is an empowerment around that. But they get a lot of help from us. I can tell you that, Scott, in order to make sure that we take action. But we're just careful in terms of building out assets in terms of manufacturing and so forth that you maybe did differently five years, six years ago and just see how you can serve those markets differently. Now, you heard as Nick said, if you take our Health Care business that is growing very well and is very profitable, they had 10% organic local currency growth in developing economies in the quarter, consumers doing well, et cetera. So when I look upon it, yes, there is a shift in between developed and developing, and we adjust accordingly. But there's still a big penetration opportunities in those countries. But you're more cautious. You are looking upon it slightly different and make sure you position yourself for the long term. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Completely understandable. Thank you, guys, I'll pass it on. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Scott. I hope you're doing well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Andrew. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just instead of asking a question on margins, I just want to zero in on Electronics & Energy. If we go back to 2013, the margins bottomed out at 15%, and you reported a margin almost 25%. Could you just focus on that business and explain to us what is it you were able to do there, and how does it translate into changes that are taking place at 3M at large? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Andrew, good morning. Yes, you're right. I think it started out like 15.7% or something, and now it's an incredible improvement relative to margins. What had happened is, first of all, we realigned the businesses, as you maybe recall. We did that in late 2012. And one of the reasons for that was we reduced the number of business groups. So we tried to build out relevance for our customers. We reduced the number of divisions, meaning tried to get out more efficiency, more productivity, and get more alignment with the market and the customer. So we were able to respond faster with technology platforms. If you take this specific business, Electronics & Energy [EEBG], we went from eight or nine divisions to four divisions. We relentlessly looked upon the structure of it and we reallocated assets in a better way that we had for that specific business that they have to utilize maybe in between three different business groups. Now we add it together so they could manage it, which helped them to drive efficiency in the manufacturing, be able to respond much faster to customer demands, and also they address a lot of, I would say, issues in the portfolio. So you remember, we had this analysis where we had Heartland division strategic \u2013 or push forward and then under strategic review. They addressed all of that. And as I've said earlier and I think this is now showing again, I said it last two quarters that the margin for that business is now at the point that it's not dependent on big growth on top line only to drive margins. So we have now proven that for the third quarter that the model is now streamlined, efficient, with very good combination of manufacturing, commercialization, and R&D capabilities in a very streamlined organization. And I will say; you said \u2013 you referred to the rest of 3M. It's the same everywhere, but this business group could get a bigger lift because where they started. One business that you see had a very good result this quarter is Consumer. Consumer 2012 also started with eight divisions, and now four divisions. We worked to streamline the organization. We took out unnecessary layers in the organization. We have addressed span of control and levels in the organization, and that is happening everywhere in 3M. You see bigger benefit from some short term because they had a lower starting point, but EEBG had the lowest. And if you're running 15.7% operating margin and are part of 3M, that is not us. And I will compliment that business group for taking that on and work it through, and today we see the result. It's nice to see. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And a follow-up question on China. Do you think you will see any benefit from RMB devaluation offsetting just weaker macro there? It's an export business, as I understand. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Andrew, we're watching for that. And the change \u2013 the movement in the renminbi has been fairly modest. We're not seeing a movement on that. And if it is we expect it to be minor, although we do see it as a positive development for that portion of the business, but minor at this point. Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to pick up on the inventory question. You called out inventory headwinds in 2Q. Clearly, it's impacting 3Q as well. Do you have any sense on how deep we are into this correction and whether we might get into a situation where sell-through is somewhat equal to sell-in? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It depends on which business group or which market you are in. But I will say that my own observation when I look upon it for the last three to five years generally speaking there's a much better correlation in between sell-in and sell-out for most companies and most markets; and I will say, if you think about retail and consumer, much, much better. So you can see a slight change from ending of a quarter to a new quarter based on maybe the season and so forth. But I would say it's generally speaking very well balanced today, which is also then giving us an opportunity to be more efficient in fact relative to our manufacturing and production and so forth. But to give a timing on it is difficult. I cannot do that, Nigel, to be honest with you. It's very difficult to do. But I think overall, management of inventory is handled much, much more effectively generally speaking, which is good for all of us. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very fair. And then just to home in on 4Q, it looks like you're forecasting your 1% midpoint core growth for 4Q very similar to what you did in 3Q. I'm just wondering, though, given the developments through the quarter, in particular the latest step down in the EM currencies, have you seen any change in behavior in places like Brazil or Southeast Asia, maybe even Canada or Australia, on the back of these movements? And maybe in particular, just home in on pricing power because you successfully continue to pass through a lot of currency weakness in price. I'm wondering. Has there been any change in behavior over the past few months? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Nigel, in the last few months, what we've seen in FX movements more recently has been more focused on developing market currencies, whereas early in the year it was more in developed market currencies. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And what you're seeing \u2013 how you're seeing that manifest is developing market currencies is where 3M has a little more pricing power, ability to raise price to offset that FX movement, and that's why we're seeing the 110 basis points of price growth in the third quarter. About 75% of that 110 basis points we attribute to FX movements. So we've seen some shift though very subtle in that as the year has gone on. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But no change in your ability to pass on that weakness in price? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, it's been \u2013 that part, parsing it out between developed and developing has remained remarkably stable. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Steven. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, I just want to follow up Nigel's question quickly on the pricing point. You mentioned, Nick, that 75% was FX-related. So as you look at unit volumes versus non-currency-related pricing going into the fourth quarter, are you therefore implying a pickup on unit volumes at this point? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Our range for the year of 1.5% to 2% does not anticipate a very significant movement in price growth in the fourth quarter from where we've been running in the first nine months of the year. I think we're expecting it to be very close to where we have been running so far this year. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, including unit volumes. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And then unit volumes will, depending on the implied range for fourth quarter that 1.5% to 2% says for the year, unit volumes could range to slightly negative to slightly positive in the fourth quarter. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then on the restructuring and ERP pacing, so one of my questions here is you've called out that ERP, the savings from ERP over time, I think you mentioned again in this call $500 million to $700 million annually, was it? And the restructuring, you've got another $130 million in 2016. First of all, is that incremental to the ERP, the track record, is the trending for ERP pacing? I assume there's an enablement. Are they completely separate? Is one enabled by the other? And is there any financial overlap between the two? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : There is some overlap between the two that the progress we're making with business transformation and the actions we're taking have enabled some of the restructuring actions that we announced this morning. We still see ourselves on that path from the $500 million to $700 million. This restructuring announcement enables us to accelerate the path to that $500 million to $700 million a little faster. That's a portion of that $130 million of savings. It's by no means the dominant portion of that savings we're talking about. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And given the short payback period there, it just makes me think that there's still a lot of opportunity within 3M for additional restructuring. Is that an unfair comment? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know if it's an unfair comment. We are living in a competitive world, and we adjust as we go. When you look upon this, we are addressing here areas where we believe we will get very good return on the investment we are doing here in Q4, and it's very targeted. It's very, very targeted relative to where those opportunities lay. If you think about what we have done here over the last three years, three and a half years, we have addressed many things in terms of combining divisions and reduced the number of business groups, et cetera. And now the efficiency is now at the point where we can take the next swing at it. But I will say that when you look upon an organization like ours, we have to make sure that we really have the commercialization capabilities in place; that we have continued focus on research and development. And also I will say around Lean Six Sigma, making sure in times like this that we maybe even add more to Lean Six Sigma. What you have to ask yourself is structure, management layers, and so forth, which is necessary in some times, but then you come into other times where you just prepare yourself for the future. So the answer to your question is it's very difficult to say if you need to something more. You play it by ear and see how the competitive landscape looks like, and you adjust to that. Our commitment is to grow our business and have a good return back to our shareholders. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Deane. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I'd like to come back to a question I had asked when you first made the Polypore announcement, and so we tabled the question till it closed. And I'd be interested in hearing the ways you're envisioning leveraging this ultra-filtration technology across 3M. It reminds me a bit of Ceradyne and the way all the different product areas that would benefit from ceramic technology. So how do you expect to leverage Polypore? I know it's in Industrial, but I would imagine there are some interesting applications on the Health Care side. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, you are correct. It's housed now, if you like, in the Industrial business group with very close linkage to our Purification business because maybe from a commercialization perspective see the fastest opportunity for us to leverage both of those businesses. When you look upon the technology and where it can move out, I will say it's maybe in life sciences. We don't call it life sciences, but it's a combination of Health Care and biotech where there are big opportunities for us. And we do business in the biotech area, not necessarily with our Health Care business group, but very much with the Purification business, and there are big opportunities for us that we can build out. But at this point in time, the total focus is short term to integrate the business, make sure we get full leverage based on what we have paid, and can give back to the shareholders based on what we paid for that business. But you're right. I think you have more opportunities in businesses going versus Health Care, life sciences, biotech, than you have for instance in Consumer and Safety & Graphics. But we take it seriously now in terms of integrating the business and execute the plan as a first step. So we don't migrate the resources in R&D and start to \u2013 they need to present very specific programs and opportunities in order to get the resources to expand the business as we move ahead. So more to come, Deane, we are now focused to integrate them and integrate the model and execute. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then second question, I was hoping you could share with us some of the decision-making and the timing on the move of Health Care IT into strategic review. So what prompted it? What changed? And then so we have the vernacular correctly within how you frame your businesses, I would assume this had been in Heartland, not push-forward. And so what bumped it into strategic review and when? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, it was in push-forward. It was not in Heartland. It was in push-forward. And I think the important thing that was for sure not in the first category under strategic review. It is a business that is doing very well. I think it's our responsibility to look upon all businesses to say can we get better benefit in a different business model. Is there more value that can be created in a different way for some of our businesses? This business could be one of them where we would like to evaluate. And as you know, it could be a spin, it could be a sell, or we keep it. We are making that evaluation now, and we will know because I wouldn't like to move forward and ahead of our own process. And at the end of Q1, we should know how the outcome of that will be. If you go back and look upon \u2013 in my view at least, today we have a very good process in order to mesh our businesses and try to understand where we can leverage even more. And in some cases we have to ask the question. Can we lever more and can there be more return to shareholders in a different business model? I think that's my responsibility to do and I think it's our team's responsibility to do, and then we do it. So it's not always a business that is under-performing that you need to evaluate. Sometimes in a case like this, you have to look upon it. And it had been on my mind for some time, I would say, but I'm very careful to not overload the initiatives relative to the portfolio. My first objective was to make sure that we got all businesses to a respectable position. And I think we are there now, as you have seen as a result, in EEBG as well. And then there's a time for everything, and now we are here. We have announced it. We are transparent about it. And then we have to see at the end of Q1 what the next step will be. Any case, it's a fantastic business. If it's with us, if it's a spin, or it's sold, it's just fantastic. So there's nothing wrong with this business. And it takes courage to take a step like this in a business doing as well as this is doing. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Can we just come back to restructuring? Inge, as you had pointed out, you've done a lot of internal blocking and tackling in this consolidation of these segment divisions underneath the segments. How would you size what you're announcing here in the fourth quarter relative to the normal ongoing restructuring that 3M must do every day? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is, of course, bigger. So if you're talking about where you normally type of challenge every step on the way, that's what you're talking about. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So those so-called adjustments, I would say that's more an adjustment of the organization that you do. And you ask yourself the question every time you get an opening, do we need to replace it and so forth. This is more sizable at this point in time. And why now is very much that I feel now that we have a very good handle on our model in terms of operations. So it's like when you go through everything as you describe it, you have pieces that are moving the whole time in your portfolio, et cetera. Then you're coming to more of a sterilization. Now you look upon it to say okay, is there more that can be done and should we do it now? So it's 1,500 people. It's sizable, in my view, for each individual person that is impacted by it, so I'm very sensitive to the whole situation. But it's something that we need to do in order to build strengths on strengths. So people can view it as saying 1,500, is it a lot or is it not enough? For us it's perfect at this point in time. And I don't underestimate that because I understand the impact for each individual of those 1,500 that need to go away and do something different. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And as you've restructured these other segments though, then just ostensibly there's excess overhead and facilities. Those have just attrited down through this process, or would we expect that at some future date not too distant in the future there could be other moves like this? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, as I said earlier, in my view and our view is as we move ahead here, we have an opportunity in our supply chain area. And that will be maybe something we will talk about as we move ahead. But that's different in a way. That's about the whole model of us improving our balance sheet, our turns and reduced inventory and so forth. And if you do that as you go down the line, you cannot think about that there are less distribution centers maybe fewer manufacturing sites, et cetera. So the beauty with all that, despite we are doing very well, there are still opportunities in 3M in order to create value. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And then just one really quick one. Was there any change in the monthly trends in your business, Inge? We've heard from some that July and August was okay, and then September was much more challenging. Did you see anything like that across your business? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Jeff, this is Nick. No, no, we didn't. As we look at the three months, they were all very similar. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The Electronics margins were pretty strong despite the continued revenue pressure there. What's going on there in Electronics? And I guess where do you go from this higher base? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Steve, Inge talked a little bit about this earlier about the margins going on there. A number of things of some of the consolidations that have occurred, the push on productivity and relevance with our customers, and building a business there that is not dependent on growth as a way to generate a margin in this range. That going forward, this is still a business that we see opportunities for growth in the future. So we continue to invest in this business. And as far as margins going further, I'm not ready to make a statement like that yet. But we continue to see this business growing and with margins that are at or slightly higher than the total company margins. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So I guess just stepping back to the macro a bit, I guess from your commentary, I just want to make sure that I'm reading what you're saying the right way. You're basically saying that there's not a lot of inventory dynamics going on here. So I guess as we look at the second half of the year with volume flat, is there any real impetus for a pickup as you move into next year? Or is this kind of the \u2013 look, this is the environment we're in, that's why you guys are taking restructuring? You're holding the line on price a little bit better than expected. I just want to make sure I parse out the macro comments and understand where your head is at on the degree of potential acceleration or good news that could come moving beyond the fourth quarter. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Steve, as we look forward, we remain constructive on our view of the global economy for 2016, albeit we're expecting a similar slow growth environment to what we're seeing in 2015. You're talking, when you talk about, ask about impetus of other things changing, as we look at 2016 for us, in addition to that slower growth organic world, we are expecting raw material benefits to continue into 2016, but at a lower level than what we've seen in 2015. This restructuring that we discussed this morning, that will be accretive to our views for 2016. Pension, OPEB, right now we see that as a benefit to us in 2016 of approximately $100 million. And of course, we'll continue to drive productivity in our company as well as getting benefits from our capital allocation strategy that we have been following and will continue to follow. Headwinds that I see right now going forward into 2016, FX has been a headwind throughout 2015. We see it being a headwind for us in 2016, just not on the same level. We see it at a lower level than what we've seen in 2015. And then just to round it out, as I look at 2016 I also see interest expense. As we're following our capital structure, capital allocation strategy, we see interest expense going up in 2016. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So I guess does this year, I guess next year, can you still get to that longer-term model that you guys have talked about, that close to double digit, even with current volume levels? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Steve. We're still in the stages of putting together our entire 2016 plan. We'll share more details on that on our December 15 conference call. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. I had to try, thanks. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve, always a pleasure. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Nick, hi. Just following up on the comments around capital allocation and what that means for interest expense and so on, just more broadly I guess when you're thinking about the buyback target for the medium term that you'd laid out a few years ago, maybe talk about what's the scope for that to move up and how you view the credit rating in the context of the propensity to increase capital allocation. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, thanks for the question, Julian. We're continuing to follow our capital allocation and capital structure strategy that we've laid out. We do see that we're continuing to make progress on that capital allocation strategy. You saw in 2015 us deploying $3.5 billion into mergers and acquisitions. Our plan does call for us leveraging our balance sheet to grow the business, investing first in the business but maintaining some flexibility for opportunistic deployment. And we're continuing on the path we've laid out, Julian. In regards to your question about debt rating, as we've indicated in the past, we would consider a downgrade for the right value-creating strategic opportunity. Those include acquisitions as well as times when we see 3M as a good value to buy ourselves. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, and then just a very quick follow-up on emerging market demand. Obviously, a lot of people have expected that to tail off for 3M in recent months. It didn't happen in Q3. Just to confirm, as you entered this quarter, how were the emerging market organic trends in aggregate? Were they fairly similar to a few months ago? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I think so, maybe even \u2013 yes, if you take in totality, yes. China shifted a little bit positive for us actually in this quarter, not much, but a little bit. So you go minus 3% to plus 3%. So you're not overly happy with core business China up 3%, but it's much better than minus 3%. So I would say I think we went sideways with almost 2% growth in what I call developing economies. My view there is you adjust your organization as you speak, but I still specifically in domestic businesses, which for us is Health Care and Consumer, huge penetration opportunities. And then for the rest, it would be very much based on the global economy and export businesses, et cetera. But I would say in between Q2 and Q3, we went sideways with some small growth. As you know, Brazil is a tough time. We're minus 2% in Brazil, but that was slightly better than in Q2 anyhow. So it's a tougher situation, but it's absolutely not hopeless. And we have penetration opportunities that we try to go after them. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, just one quick one. With the productivity related to the ERP and supply chain improvements, do you see the benefits flowing through in a fairly even cadence from here, or will there be extra costs in 2016 and 2017 that will dilute the impact initially and then make it stronger later in the decade? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Laurence, two parts to the question that I'll go through here. First of all, from the cost standpoint of our investment in business transformation, we're at a point where we're at the peak of what we're investing in this, and any incremental investments would be small or non-existent of what we're spending on that initiative. In the coming years, we expect to see ourselves growing to build to that $500 million to $700 million of operating income benefit that we've shared. I'm quite confident as we talk on December 15 about our outlook for 2016, you'll start to see some of those benefits being shared at that time and how they'll impact 2016, starting small, but then growing as we progress to 2020. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. To wrap up, we continued to deliver solid operational performance in 2015, and I thank our whole 3M team for an outstanding effort. This quarter, we expanded margins and posted strong earnings while taking many actions to strengthen our long-term competitiveness. We're executing our plan and controlling what we can control and building for the future. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Matthew Ginter - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 business review. Let me kick off today with a reminder of our upcoming 2016 investor events. On Tuesday, March 29, we will be hosting an Investor Day at our headquarters in St. Paul, including a welcome reception the evening before at our new R&D laboratory. Registration for the event will be sent out later this week. Also, our upcoming quarterly earnings calls are scheduled for April 26, July 26 and October 25. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, today's earnings release and slide presentation are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Now please turn to slide three, and I will hand off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will open my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, and later in the call, I will give you a recap of our full year performance. 3M finished 2015 with another quarter of disciplined execution in a challenging external environment. Across our enterprise we controlled the controllable while investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to our earnings per share, we posted GAAP EPS of $1.66, down 8% year-over-year. As you recall, in October we announced our corporate restructuring which was completed in the fourth quarter. This action resulted in a Q4 pre-tax charge of $114 million and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016. Excluding this Q4 charge, we posted earnings per share of $1.80. Company-wide organic local currency sales declined 1.1%. Consistent with our expectations at our December outlook meeting, organic growth was down low single digits in our two industrial-related businesses, namely Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Also, as expected, Electronics and Energy decreased in the high single digits as the consumer electronics market softened. On the positive side, our two consumer-driven businesses posted strong organic growth in the quarter. Consumer was up nearly 3% organically while Health Care increased almost 5%, its highest growth of the year. Acquisitions added 1.5 percentage points to our sales while the stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by nearly 6%. In total, Q4 sales were $7.3 billion. Looking at margins, we delivered another good broad-based performance in the quarter. When you exclude restructuring, margins were up 60 basis points to a healthy 22%, with four of our five business groups posting margins greater than 21%. In the fourth quarter we posted strong free cash flow, with a robust 182% conversion. We also continued to invest in our business while returning nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall we had a solid finish to the year. And now I will turn the call over to Nick who will go through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering sales growth on slide four. Organic local currency sales declined 1.1% in the fourth quarter with volumes down 2.3%, partially offset by selling prices which were up 1.2%. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.5 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business and Ivera Medical. Along with the divestitures of Library Systems and our license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency impacts reduced sales by 5.8 percentage points with notable year-on-year declines in the euro, yen and Brazilian real. As a result in U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter worldwide sales declined 5.4% versus last year. In the United States, organic growth was down slightly as we experienced weak end market demand in our Industrial related businesses. At the same time, our consumer orientated businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continued to deliver positive organic growth. Organic growth in Asia-Pacific declined 2.7%. Three of our five business groups posted positive growth in the region, led by Health Care and Consumer while Electronics and Energy declined high single digits. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth declined by 3% in both Japan and China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics businesses, Japan was up 3% organically while China/Hong Kong declined 3%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.1% with Central East Europe up high single digits, West Europe up slightly, and Middle East Africa down mid-single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada declined 60 basis points. Brazil declined 6% while Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth increasing 7%. Please turn to slide five for the fourth quarter P&L. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion, with operating income of $1.5 billion. GAAP operating margins in the quarter were 20.5%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year. Excluding restructuring, margins increased 60 point points to 22.1%, which reflects our ability to execute and effectively control those things within our control. On the right hand side of this slide you'll see the various components of our fourth quarter margin performance. Let me comment on the primary drivers impacting margins during the quarter. Lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 2 percentage points of margin expansion. Our global sourcing teams continue to capitalize on the impact of lower commodity prices and are generating additional savings above market. Foreign currency net of hedge gains decreased margins by 30 basis points. Fourth quarter strategic investments lowered margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio management actions in our renewable energy business. Similar to past quarters, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 60 basis points. Finally, our fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $114 million reduced margins by 160 basis points. As Inge mentioned, these actions will result in a pre-tax savings of approximately $130 million in 2016. Let's now turn to slide six for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, down 8.3% year-on-year. Our restructuring decreased GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share. Excluding these costs, earnings were $1.80. As you see, a number of other factors also impacted our earnings. Growth and margin expansion added $0.03 to earnings in the quarter, which includes headwinds of $0.05 from pension expense and $0.04 from strategic investments. Excluding restructuring, our fourth quarter tax rate was 28.6% versus 28% in last year's fourth quarter. This reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $96 million or the equivalent of $0.11 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 4% year-over-year, which added $0.06 to fourth quarter EPS. Please turn to slide seven. We delivered strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter with a conversion rate of 182%. The primary driver was improved working capital. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up $199 million year-over-year. For the full year, we posted free cash flow conversion of 103%, similar to 2014. In 2015, we continued to manage towards a better optimized capital structure. We added leverage of approximately $4 billion which helped fund investments in organic growth, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we invested $446 million in CapEx, bringing our full year investment to just under $1.5 billion. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. During 2015, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.6 billion and gross share repurchases of $5.2 billion. Now let's review our business group performance starting with Industrial on slide eight. Industrial posted quarterly sales of $2.5 billion. Organic growth was minus 1.8%, reflecting a slow industrial economy which impacted our business. In particular, our advanced materials business declined high single digits impacted by weak demand in the oil and gas end market. On a positive note, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits as we continued to gain share by increasing 3M's content per vehicle. This business has consistently grown faster than global car and light truck production levels. 3M purification also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. The acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which enhances 3M's core filtration platform, added 1.7 percentage points to Industrial sales growth. Integration activities and financial performance are on track and meeting expectations. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was positive in EMEA, Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific while the U.S. declined mid-single digits. The Industrial business delivered operating income of $476 million in the quarter with operating margins of 19.3% or 21% excluding restructuring. In addition, the business is absorbing the Polypore's Separations Media acquisition which reduced margins by another 50 basis points. Please turn to slide nine. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were down 2.5% organically to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, organic growth in this business was up over 9% in Q4 2014 which included a $30 million impact from Ebola-related demand for personal safety products. Excluding this impact, Q4 sales in our Safety and Graphics business was flat organically. Within Safety and Graphics our commercial solutions business had another solid quarter which capped off a strong full year of mid-single digit growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added 4.6 percentage points to sales growth. As a reminder, in August we acquired Capital Safety, a leading provider of fall protection equipment. Integration is on track, and the business is meeting operating income targets. On a geographic basis, organic growth declined in all regions. Operating income was $282 million in the quarter, and operating margins increased 1 percentage point to 21.8%, or 22.7%, excluding restructuring. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures added 150 basis points to Safety and Graphic's fourth quarter operating margins. Please turn to slide 10. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double digit increases in both health information systems and food safety, with other oral care up mid-single-digits in the quarter. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 80 basis points to fourth quarter sales growth and continues to exceed performance objectives. Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas, led by Asia-Pacific. This business continues to drive penetration in developing markets with 8% organic growth in the quarter. China/Hong Kong was particularly strong with double digit organic growth. Operating income was $444 million, up nearly 3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Health Care's operating margins were 32.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, or up 180 basis points, excluding restructuring. We continue to be pleased with the strong and consistent performance of our Health Care business and will continue to invest in this business to drive greater success. Next let's cover Electronics and Energy on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales for this business group were $1.2 billion, down 7.7% organically. On the electronics side, organic sales declined 8%, impacted by weakness in the consumer electronics end market and excess channel inventory. We expect this softness to continue into the first quarter. Our energy-related businesses were down 6% organically as sales declined in renewable energy, telecom and electrical markets. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down across all areas. Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $200 million, with operating margins of 16.5% or 17.5%, excluding restructuring. In addition, portfolio management actions in our Renewable Energy business reduced Electronics and Energy margins by 2.4 percentage points. For the full year, operating margins were 21.1%, up from 19.9% in 2014. Our portfolio actions in this business group over the last three years continued to pay off in 2015. These actions are enabling us to deliver solid margins even in the face of challenging conditions in both Electronics and Energy end markets. I'll finish with our Consumer business on slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. Organic growth was solid 2.7% paced by our home improvement business. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands, such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives. Stationery and office supplies and home care were also up organically while organic sales declined in consumer health care. Fourth quarter holiday sales were strong, driven by solid demand for our category-leading Scotch and Command branded products. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was broad-based across all areas, led by the U.S. Consumer's operating income was $254 million with operating margins of 23.1% or 23.4% excluding restructuring. That wraps up our review of the fourth quarter business results. Please turn to slide 13, and I'll turn it back over to Inge. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Nick. With another solid margin and cash flow performance, our fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution and efficient growth from our global team. Even in a low growth environment, we expanded full year margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3%, excluding restructuring. In 2015, for second year in a row we posted free cash flow conversion above 100%. We also delivered a strong return on invested capital of 22.5%, coming on top of a 22% return in 2014. Beyond these solid financial results, I view 2015 as a fundamentally important year in terms of 3M's future. This is because of the investments we made and the actions we took to position our company for long-term success. As you see, last year, we invested a total of $7 billion in research and development, acquisitions and CapEx. We also made significant progress on our three key levers which represent important value creators for our enterprise. The first is portfolio management, which is all about strengthening and focusing in our portfolio of businesses. We do this through both acquisitions and divestiture and also through business consolidation. Last year, we took actions on all fronts. In Health Care, as an example, we combined our dental and orthodontic businesses into one single oral care solution business. Consolidating businesses allow us to allocate resources to our best opportunities while creating greater customer relevance, scale, productivity, and improved speed. Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from six sectors to five business groups and from 40 businesses to 26. To complement organic growth, we also made three strategic acquisitions in 2015. This includes Capital Safety and Polypore's Separations Media business which enhanced two of our core technology platforms, personal safety and filtration. At the same time, we divested three businesses that no longer fit within our portfolio. Investing in innovation is our second lever. Last year, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. As you have heard me say many times, research and development is the heartbeat of our company. It enables us to both invent and manufacture cutting-edge, relevant and unique products for our customers. This in turn drives organic growth, which is our primary growth metric and also supports our premium margins and return on invested capital. Last year, in addition to investing in technology development, we took action to better connect our scientific capabilities to our customers around the world. We opened six new customer technical centers, including in West Europe, Middle East/Africa and Asia-Pacific. We also opened our new state-of-the-art research laboratory in the United States which we look forward to showing you at our Investor Day in March. Our third lever, business transformation, starts and ends with our customers. It's about transforming our business processes to make it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us anywhere around the world. The backbone of business transformation is our new global ERP system. In 2015, we made good progress, most recently, with the successful roll-out in the Nordic countries. We also announced the creation of three global service centers which will optimize our delivery of transactional services and service a broader platform for operational effectiveness into the future. We expect business transformation to result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. That covers our three levels, and I'm very pleased with our progress in all of them. In addition to work we did on those levers, we made other investments to position 3M for success in both the short- and long-term. As we have talked about before, we run our company with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope. Or in other words, making sure we are positioned for success today and many years into the future. Let me give you two examples. First, on the telescope view, we made a significant investment related to our brand equity. Our 3M brand is strong, and last year we invested in a new brand platform, 3M Science. Applied to Life. To make it even stronger. This will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems for our customers which go back to our vision of improving every company, every home and every life. Next on the microscope view, we completed a corporate restructuring focused on structural overhead and slower growing markets which will help us manage through the current economic realities. And we made all these investments last year while also return $8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. As you can see, we are continuing to build an even stronger, more competitive company that will win in 2016 and beyond. And on slide 14, you will see our planning estimates for this year which are unchanged from December's outlook meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.10 to $8.45, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3%, with acquisitions adding 1% to sales. Finally, we expect our free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Scott. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It looks like you were pretty aggressive in restructuring in 4Q. Can you give us a sense of the payback, what kind of tailwind in 2016, and what impact on guidance I suppose? And then just how much of that restructuring do you think you have to continue to do in 2016, just given the relatively weak macro out there? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Scott, the restructuring that we announced in October, throughout the fourth quarter we executed that almost exactly as we laid out then. We're for the fourth quarter $114 million pre-tax charge. And from that we're expecting $130 million operating income benefit in 2016. We expect that benefit to be pretty evenly loaded across the four quarters of 2016. And in regards to need for others, based on the outlook we have for the business and for the rest of 2016, we never say never but we don't \u2013 we're not anticipating anything at this time. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Scott, this is Inge. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We just came off kickoff for the year under the theme of efficient growth. And I think it's important for us to say, that as Nick said, you never know what you need to take for action, but my view is now with a range 1% to 3% on the top line, even in the lower range of that we should be able to prepare our self for when the market turnaround and stat to grow again. So I would like to have an efficient model where we can deliver now but also be prepared as we see things start to turn around, hopefully later in the year, but for sure you'll go into the future a couple of years. So you're right. You never know if it's becoming tough or what you need to do. But I think with the action we took now, at least I feel that we are prepared to deliver what we are telling you. And also, equally important, be ready to go offensive as soon as we see it's coming. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, makes sense, Inge. Is part of the go offensive potential related to M&A? I mean, you still have plenty of balance sheet space. And I would assume, given what's going on in the public markets, that private market evaluations are coming down a bit. Would you entertain getting more aggressive with M&A in 2016 if we're in a soft spot that gets tougher? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the primary strategy for us is organic local currency growth. But I think we are willing and open to do things like we did in 2015. We did a couple of good acquisitions in 2015 in order to build out our platforms both from a technology perspective, but also be more relevant in the market. So the answer to that is that the pipeline is good for our businesses and again it's coming back to the evaluation of the asset as we look upon them. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Steve. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Could you talk about the destocking impact within that negative 2.3%? What are you seeing in the channels and sell in, sell out and how much of a factor was that this quarter? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : When we look upon the inventory, you can say that consumer-related businesses like Health Care and Consumer, they're on a level that is very good, right. And you see the growth there. I will say that if you look upon industrial-related businesses, there's maybe a couple of weeks, but not more than two, of excess inventory in the channels as we see it. And if you go to consumer electronics, it's a little bit higher. And we estimate that maybe to be like maybe closer to three weeks of excess inventory at this point in time in the channels. So let's say two plus in industrial-related business and Electronics and Energy, or consumer electronic. And we don't see any issues at all in the Health Care and Consumer businesses. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that means unless things get worse you'd expect that to be fully flushed out in the quarter we're in right now, Q1 or...? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we have to be on careful on the industrial sized businesses and consumer electronic. I don't know if it will be flushed out this coming quarter, but it should be if end market come back a little bit. I would say you should think about it in the second quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : When we look upon growth rate, and I think Nick said that in consumer electronic and our business EEBG, we say that growth rate Q1 be very similar to Q4. Maybe slightly worse, but I will say similar. And for the company, we will compensate that through our Consumer and Health Care businesses and a little bit more uptick in Industrial. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And on page five, the productivity and other contribution of 0%, I know that's ex restructuring down in the bottom. But maybe just talk through again. I think I missed or not sure why that's only zero. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Steve, that's a function partially of a lower growth environment that we're offsetting inflation that we're seeing there. But it's not enhancing our margin. It's tougher in a lower negative growth environment to be eking out productivity, plus we used our levers of restructuring and which we called out separately with the 1.6% impact on the margin. So we executed strongly to adjust the cost structure. But in the end, outside of the restructuring, it had zero impact on our total margin for the quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Well, all the incremental or decremental leverage on the organic volume was 0.2% below that, right? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So this was just purely, you're just saying you offset the wage inflation and is that usually around a couple percent or is it much lower right now? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Total wage inflation is more in the 2% to 3% range. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, wanted to follow up on Scott's question regarding has any of the year-opening market volatility changed your plan to add incremental debt or any changes in your buyback strategy for 2016? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Deane, our strategy that we announced in December for incremental leverage and for gross share repurchases of \u2013 we announced that to be in the $4 billion to $6 billion range. Those remain unchanged for us. That's our plan, we think it continues to be the good and right plan for us for 2016. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. And, Nick, maybe just walk through the \u2013 I know seasonally you have strong fourth quarter cash conversion. This seems even above that. Was that any working capital improvements? And then any comments on the hedging program, how has it played out? And with regard to expectations against this volatility? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : First, Deane, on the free cash flow conversion, you know there's seasonality. The first quarter of any year is typically our lowest free cash flow conversion, and the fourth quarter of the year is typically our highest free cash flow conversion. We saw that play out in 2015, and we'd expect that to play out in 2016. In particular what you're seeing in the fourth quarter, there's a couple things. One is working capital. We did a good job managing working capital throughout the fourth quarter. And in addition, the restructuring expenses of $114 million pre-tax, much of that did not yet result in a cash outflow. That cash outflow will come in the first half of 2016. So we're seeing a little bit of movement between 2015 and 2016 there. As far as hedging, Deane, we continue to manage our hedging strategy as I've described in the past that over the next 12 months we attempt to hedge approximately 50% of our economic exposure, and then in certain developed currencies we layer on additional hedges on a diminishing scale out into the second and third year. That's playing out as we planned. For the total 2015, we had a hedging benefit of $182 million, and if foreign exchange rates stay where they are today, that $182 million will become approximately $160 million for total 2016. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : It's $160 million to the good? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : $160 million hedge gain. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. So price cost is another good margin tailwind in Q4. I just wondered how you were thinking right now about the overall $0.10 to $0.15 raw materials boost in the EPS bridge you gave six weeks ago? And when you gave that guidance, how much of that $0.10 to $0.15 was assumed to come in the first half of this year relative the second half? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Julian. We \u2013 yeah, the 200 basis points this quarter, I'll just make a little comment on that before I go on to the 2016. Of that 200 basis points, 110 basis points of that is coming from raw material commodity price benefits and another 90 basis points from increases in our selling prices. When we gave the guidance in December of $0.10 to $0.15 for raw material, we were basing that on the oil price assumption of $45 to $55 a barrel. We all know where oil is today, right around $30. A rough ballpark for us is a $10 movement in oil. It helps us for an entire year by $0.02 to $0.03. So our thinking right now is we're right about at the high end of that $0.10 to $0.15. And at the time we guided this, in December, we saw virtually all of that benefit coming in the first half of 2016. We still see it heavily weighted to the first half of 2016, but we can see some of that benefit if oil stays in this range coming into the second half as well. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question would just be around Electronics and Energy where you talked about portfolio management actions in renewables reducing the margin by 240 points. Maybe just give \u2013 maybe I missed it in your prepared remarks, but could you give some more color around what's happening there? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as you have seen, we have taken action for quite some time now in order to prepare that business really for the future. And, I think we have been successful for that relative to margin expansion and also growth rates. And as I said on the other calls, what I feel very good about is that that model now will deliver very solid margins, even in a tough economical environment with slower growth. And we have proven that's something very good about that. This quarter we took actually a write-off on an asset we had that didn't make sense any longer for us. And we asked \u2013 because we had a quarter here where we could do it, and the strategic important of that asset for us, it was not there any longer. And I'm very, very keen to prepare that business for an even stronger future. So it was based on an asset that we took a write off of. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And lastly very quickly, organic sales in Q1 overall, 3M firm wide, should we assume it's about the same or a little bit worse than the minus 1% in Q4? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say that as we said earlier, I will assume be equal to Q4. And then we will see how it play out in between the different businesses, right. For me, it looked like \u2013 and for us it looked like Health Care and Consumer will continue with an accelerated growth. We are very pleased with that because that's again showing the strengths for us in our diverse portfolio. And also when you look upon the margins that is good, right. That's very, very good margins in Health Care and as you have seen in Consumer really improve the margins the last couple of years as well. I would say that Electronics and Energy is probably a business and consumer electronics specifically that then will be similar to this quarter. Maybe slightly down in that segment specifically. But I will say, think about it as \u2013 3M as an enterprise very similar to Q4 and Q1 of this year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Shannon. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. In the Health Care business, drug delivery was up this quarter. I mean that's I think been a drag for a while. Is that now turned around? And what's your view on that piece of the business for 2016. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That business is very much project-based so it would go a little bit up and down but we will see slightly better growth rate in 2016 versus 2015. And, again, you \u2013 as you recall, this quarter you mentioned this quarter showed slight growth versus where have been in last three quarters in a tougher situation. So again based on what we see in the pipeline we are more positive on that piece of the business for 2016 versus what we were able to deliver in 2015. So your observation is correct. And I will say your assumption moving forward, we hope that you're correct on that as well. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Then just on Europe, I mean, it's something I think last year, you were kind of expecting to improve through the year, maybe came a little lower than you thought originally. What's your updated view on what you're seeing there and your expectations for Europe anything getting incrementally more encouraging or less encouraging? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Europe for long time have been a challenge relative to growth rate in the market, right? And we have taken action very much on the efficiency part and the productivity part. And as you saw when you added it together now there was a growth of Europe, Middle East, Africa but the three pieces is that Middle East/Africa down, Central Europe up 8% and slight up in West Europe. So West Europe, we have slight growth and I think that would be very dependent on how Germany can come off in 2016. And we have also to think about it that Central East Europe, that growth rate was very much price that came out from our action we took in Russia. So Central East Europe, Middle East/Africa take that portion of it, generally speaking it's a challenging environment geopolitically that we then have to be careful of. And West Europe you see some spots of growth but I think very important thing there is that Germany, the machine of Germany has started to deliver a little bit more growth. And we maybe can see a little bit more there. I think we are well prepared in that part of the world due to work that we have done for the last, I would say maybe the last five years of streamlined organization taking out structure, bigger span of control and lower levels in organization, et cetera, in terms of management. Still, kept focus on our execution around commercialization as we have so many different languages as you know over there. So you need be very nimble and fast in execution in each country and then that will reduce management structures as much as you can. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if you could come back to price. And, Inge, you mentioned that \u2013 what percent of your price is kind of actions that are countering FX kind of like you mentioned in Russia I'm sure versus like-for-like price? And maybe speak to the ability to get like-to-like price in this environment? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Jeff, I can speak on this both for the quarter and the year. It's a similar story. About 75% of our total reported price growth is in direct or indirect response to FX movements, primarily in developing markets. So if you look at our 120 basis points, about three quarters of that directly a result of FX movement. Our core ability to impact price excluding FX has ranged in the 30 basis points to 50 basis points. And we continue to see that range going forward for the company, that into 2016. The delta on top of that is \u2013 will be dependent on what happens with FX movements. But 30 basis point to 50 basis point of core, and then whatever on top of that, that may happen if FX rates move even more than what we laid out in December. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And we should assume that the write off you took is equivalent to that 2.4 points of margin pressure in E&E? Is that correct? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yep, Jeff. That's exactly correct. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then just finally, could you just speak to the actual kind of direct/indirect oil and gas exposures that you do have in Industrial and S&S (48:44)? And how you see that playing into the early part of the year especially? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. So, Jeff, to be clear you said in Industrial and Safety and Graphics? Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, I'm thinking within safety kind of fall prevention and protection gear and things like that? And then obviously in Industrial you've got some. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, some of our direct exposure is what we're selling through the personal safety line. And what I'll say to that is as 2015 progressed, we probably didn't see a lot of impact in the first quarter, and then that grew for us in 2015 in the second through fourth quarter. We continued \u2013 we expect that to continue into the first quarter of 2016. And there will still be some negative impact after that from oil and gas, but we think the worst of the comps will be behind us from oil and gas after the first quarter and then diminishing the rest of the year. Probably a similar comment for the Industrial portion. We have some of our advanced materials that are impacted by \u2013 that go into the oil and gas industry. And then we also have some exposure in our Electronics and Energy business, and the comps for that we think for the first quarter for sure, and possibly in the second quarter we'll still be seeing some challenge there. Jeff. Matthew Ginter - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jeff, to put a number on it at a total company level, if you took the businesses directly linked to oil and gas, it would be about 3% of our sales. Just as with the economy, any knock-on effects of a slower oil and gas market clearly are impacting the economy, but the direct exposure to oil and gas would be about 3% for us. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you for that color. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hi. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to go back to Nick's comments on price, 30 bps of core price plus whatever the FX movements are. But obviously you don't have price baked into your 2016 bridge specifically. But I'm assuming that's part of your organics? I'm just wondering, do you have what, right now, 50 bps of price within your organic bridge? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Nigel, in our guidance the way we said it we expect 1% to 3% organic the vast majority of that volume. So 30 basis points to 50 basis points of price in that 1% to 3% total organic growth. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to clarify the impact of acquisitions and disposals on Safety and Graphics. Obviously a strong margin performance there. But is the benefit from disposals because the Library Systems business was so much lower margin? Or is there a small gain there? Or is it both of those factors? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Nigel, we divested of two businesses in Safety and Graphics in the fourth quarter, our library systems as well as a license plate converting business in France. The net impact of those two resulted in a small gain, accretive to our earnings per share of approximately $0.015 cents. The rest of the total impact of M&A on Safety and Graphics is our acquisition of Capital Safety doing a little better than what we had been projecting. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just looking at the bridge on slide six, I think, for basically just trying kind of to understand the seasonality and kind of sequencing. Using those buckets, probably not a ton of change in tax and foreign exchange, those are probably pretty straightforward. What is the M&A contribution for first quarter year-over-year that you guys expect? I know there was some noise in numbers, obviously, with charges and stuff. But what is the M&A contribution in the first quarter year-over-year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Steve, for the total year we guided approximately $0.10 benefit. Our view is that that will be quite evenly distributed over the four quarters. So for the first quarter, roughly one-quarter of that $0.10 benefit. And that's inclusive of the impact of the most recent portfolio action that we announced a few days ago with the small business in our Industrial business. So... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Makes sense. So I guess when I kind of add all these items up, and I'm not really asking for a precise guidance here, but you guys are calling for a 7% to 12% EPS growth over the course of the year. Is that, is every quarter kind of within that range? Or with the little bit lighter organic, is that enough to get you below the low end of that range for the first quarter year-over-year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Steve... Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're trying to get us to give quarterly guidance, right? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, I think it's good to calibrate this stuff with the sequencing of what's happening in the year organically. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Steve, we've talked about the organic growth that we're expecting in the first quarter. That is a quarter that I would expect will be more challenged also from an earnings per share growth. Everything else being equal, there's not one outlier that will compensate for the, what we've already said about the organic growth in the first quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Okay. That's kind of what I was getting at. Great. And then one last question just on the balance sheet. I know in prior years you guys have kind of toggled up the repurchase in some instances. I mean, are you, given that you're at the end of your most recent kind of five-year plan, should we think about buybacks as pretty much set? Or could you kind of toggle that up like you've done in past years from your standing 2016 guide at some point? What's the appetite there? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, our appetite is pretty well-reflected by the $4 billion to $6 billion guidance that we stated. I will reiterate, our approach is there's a certain amount where we're in the market every day of buying. And then there's a portion that we are flexing up and down, depending on the relative value we see of 3M stock. And we continue to follow that playbook in how we repurchase our shares in 2016. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Just a question on Electronics and Energy. How much visibility forward do you have on this whole smartphone situation because it's one of the concerns we've been hearing from investors, that being a disproportionate hit on your business? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We have \u2013 as you know, we work on those platforms daily with our customers. So I think that when we have laid out our plan for the year, we have good understanding relative to when new introductions will come and our position on them. And we have a good position, as you know. We got to hit now, of course, not because of that we were spec-ed out or lost anything, just because the market was down. And this is estimated to be down in Q1 as well, as you have seen in media. And I think we will see an uptick coming in the second half of the year. Hopefully we have orders coming in, I would say, in terms of in end of second quarter is when we will start to see orders coming in to us for launch later in the year. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And can you help to frame the risk from technological disruption? Also been getting questions on transition to OLEDs and how that impacts the business, because I think people remember what happened a decade ago with flat screen TVs and try to draw a parallel here? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well we are aware of competition in terms of technologies to LCD such as OLED, which is the one you refer to. And we have known that for a long time. That's also one of the reasons why we realigned our organization to form our display materials and system business in early 2014. And there's an integration of those businesses into what I would call display technologies, which is a goal for the future for us to expand into. And we have already products that is going into equipment that are using OLEDs. So we are not behind in any way. We have on every, I would say, every equipment today that are using OLED, we have multiple applications in them. And there's more to come in that area. But we have been working on this area for quite some time. And that's part of our model. That's why I would say the strengths of 3M through our technology platforms, this is exactly where it is, right. So I see more opportunities as you go ahead over the longer term as we are working with our customers on it. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Obviously some good margin performance in Industrial and Safety and Graphics despite lower organic growth. So as you go through the year, how much ability do you have to keep margins up even with the headwinds that you see? I know you had guided to about 150 basis points of margin improvement for the company for 3M in 2016 when you had your guidance call. Is that still what you expect within the guidance? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Andy, that 150 basis points, that's still a good ballpark. There's a lot of things that are going into that, including our estimate of 1% to 3% organic growth. Some productivity coming from things such as our business transformation investment, our pension expense as well as some strategic investments. All-in, we're seeing many of those things play out exactly as we guided in December. The 150 basis points is still a good number. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And your consumer businesses were strong in the quarter. Maybe they slowed a little bit versus last quarter and year-over-year growth. So just the resiliency of the consumer right now, it seems like the consumer is still pretty strong, but your view? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it is very strong. And I think there is a couple of things that is important to think about relative to 3M and our position in the market. We are very strong in United States in our consumer business. So we have a stronger and better penetration in United States than we have outside of United States. If you look upon United States specifically, and you look upon data and facts, which is a key indicator for us relative to potential growth rates, we all know that there is a challenge on IPI as we go into 2016. And the fact there is saying that it's slower Q1, Q2, maybe Q3, and then Q4 it will pick up again on IPI year-over-year. If you look upon retail sales index, it's actually different. It's very robust as we go in already to Q1 and Q2 and for the rest of the year. So I would say that our business there is in a good position. And we feel very good about it. We have very good brands. We add a lot of value into the channels, and we are managing a lot of categories in that business. The same goes for Health Care. Health Care is the same. Health Care for us, and I'm not talking U.S. versus outside of U.S. there. I am talking about developed economies versus developing economies. And 80% of our portfolio in Health Care is in developed economies, meaning developing is still a huge opportunity for us. And we are growing very well there. And our margins are very high. So I think that's coming back to in times like this, where you see some challenges in some economies around the world, if that's in Industrial or Electronics or even in safety. We have the advantage that we have domestic-driven businesses in Consumer and Health Care that this carries on. And you saw that this quarter again, Health Care had almost 5% organic local currency, the strongest for the year and with margin expansion. It's just a fantastic business for us and the same go for consumer. So we feel very, very good about them. And it's sustainable. I think that's the important thing that it is a sustainable business model for us based on world class product solutions. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So two quick questions. Maybe focused on your Industrial business for a second. Inge, you've had some distributors recently talking about improving short cycle trends in January and there's been some green shoots that we're seeing as well out of the semi sector. Just wondering is there anything across your Industrial business today where you're starting to feel better about things incrementally or is it still \u2013 the trends are still very similar to what we've been feeling for the last six months? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I would say that there are certain pieces in our business that are doing very well. And I can \u2013 3M purification is doing extremely well. Had a growth rate in the quarter of 10%. And for the full year 8%. Automotive OEM is doing very well for us. Had a growth in the quarter of 7% and in fact for the whole year is around 7%. And then I think that some \u2013 where the pressure is just now is I would say general manufacturing. And then that go broad based, right? But I will not say short term. As we're talking here in the next quarter or the next five months, I don't see that we will see a big pick up. I think it would be very similar in Q1 versus Q4. But some businesses doing very well; automotive OEM and purification doing extremely well. But we have also to think about it in terms of growth on a global base. So United States, there was pressure this quarter down 6. But we were growing in many other cases around the world. And I think that's important to think about in terms of us as a global growth company. So we had organic growth in India, China. We grew 6% in China. If you think about that, it's a big market, second biggest subsidiary for 3M outside of United States and the second biggest economy in the world. Still for us our Industrial business in the quarter, 6% growth; we had 3% growth in Japan and United States was an issue. So I think we have to balance it out in terms of how we look upon the future here. And we have decided and we are a global growth company. So I will say that as you go into the year, we will see \u2013 we should see, we should see an uptick coming into the second half of 2016 for Industrial. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's a really helpful color, Inge, and maybe my follow-on for Nick. Now that the restructuring is done at least the cost actions have been taken in 4Q, any additional color you can give us on the cadence of the restructuring? I know it needs \u2013 it's going to be the restructuring benefits. I know it's supposed to be second half weighted but any additional color would be great. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Joe, the benefits in fact will not be second half weighted. From a comp standpoint, yes, but the fact that charge out came in the fourth quarter of 2015. But the actual benefits going forward will be quite evenly weighted across the fourth quarters of 2016. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Oh great. That's great color. Nice job executing in this tough environment, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Joe. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Two quick ones. Just wanted to flag \u2013 in auto OEM are you seeing any soft spots around the world? And secondly as you look at your share gains, do you see those as sustainable? Or is that a pro-cyclical phenomena that is as end markets improve your pace of share gains slows down? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. They are sustainable. If you think about it, you're going to look upon the facts we have now for three to four years outgrown the automotive production on a global base. So our growth is always more robust than the total output of cars produced. That is indicating that we penetrate and take more application per car. That is sustainable by definition, due to the fact that we provide solutions that is helping automotive industries with technology conversion. So don't view us as a commodity player that is coming in, he has to try to replace someone. For us, it's about technology conversion moving you to the next level on your specific retail in order for you to be able to compete in the marketplace. So that is sustainable by definition, and that's what 3M is all about. I will not say today that I see any differentiation where someone is becoming much, much stronger geographically, some other weaker geographically in terms of production of cars. That is where we play, right. We design-in, spec-in always at the headquarters of companies, if that's in Germany, Japan or United States. And then where the car is produced, that is where we have the teams to put the application in place, a type of development and deployment. And I don't feel there's any differentiation there on a geographical base. But our model is sustainable. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Matthew Ginter - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Lawrence. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for closing comments. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. To wrap up, 2015 was an important year for 3M as we made investments and took actions to propel ourselves for the future. As a result, we are well positioned to drive efficient growth and create greater value for our shareholders in 2016 and beyond. I thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you all here in St. Paul in March. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, July 26 and October 25. Also, take note of our next investor meeting scheduled for December 13. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 3 and I will hand it off to Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us again. We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our Investor Day, where we laid out 3M\u2019s new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than a full percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business, including opening a new world class laboratory in the United States while also returning cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share. Company-wide, organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter led by healthcare at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses. Our Consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M\u2019s most iconic brands also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. I am very pleased that our two domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continue to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strengths in commercial solutions and personal safety. Organic growth in our industrial business was down low single-digits, which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double-digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales, was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M and is an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we have returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend which marks 3M\u2019s 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All-in-all, we had a good start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations. Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our three key levers starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our Health Information Systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Health Care business, in research and development, health economics and commercialization capabilities to build strings on strings in both developed and developing markets. In February, we saw the Polyfoam business, which was a small non-core segment, within our industrial business group. Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile and more efficient. Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide with the majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success. And going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity. Investing in innovation is the second lever and in the first quarter, we invested nearly $0.5 billion in research and development. Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns. And as you recall, we continued to step up investments in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 off-scientists who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting-edge solutions for our customers. Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across West Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in the $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continue to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Inge and good morning everyone. I will start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate converting business in France. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted the growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia-Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of five business groups posted positive growth in the region again led by Health Care and Consumer. Soft end market demand and excess channel inventories in Consumer Electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics business, Japan and China/Hong Kong were both flat. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%, West Europe was up slightly, and the combination of Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa was up high single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter, with 10% organic growth and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%. Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvement. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins 10 basis points as we began to take actions on our manufacturing footprint and increased growth investments. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points. And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our Electronics and Industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness going forward. All-in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins and continued to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look of earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I will walk through in a moment. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share. Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30 of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards\u2019 update related to employee share based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock based compensation, from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance sheet. Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share, net of tax costs related to global cash optimization actions. For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last three quarters of the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $314 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Let\u2019s now review our first quarter performance on a business by business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our advanced materials business declined low double-digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single-digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million. Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. Personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our roofing granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of library systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad based, paced by a mid single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million and operating margins were a solid 24.5%. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company\u2019s organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up mid single-digits or greater year-on-year. Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter and our medical consumables and oral care businesses each delivered solid mid single-digit growth in Q1. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing very well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China-Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year\u2019s first quarter and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter\u2019s results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future. Next, let\u2019s cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors including soft end market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec-in wins to deliver organic growth as the industry improves. Our energy related businesses were down 1% organically, with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in Telcom as well as Renewable Energy. As a reminder, in last year\u2019s Q4, we took portfolio actions within the Renewable Energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth, but have improved profitability in this business. Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double-digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points largely volume-related. Looking towards the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low to mid single-digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success. I will finish with our consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in three of our four businesses led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market leading brands that are powering our consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command Damage Free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth as accelerated investments continue to payoff. ScotchBlue Painter\u2019s Tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and FUTURO braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, along with solid mid single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million, with operating margins of 22.7% both similar to last year\u2019s first quarter. On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% of sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5%, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Joe. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe let\u2019s \u2013 maybe just starting off on Electronics since that seemed to be like the biggest, I guess, surprise in the quarter at least from our perspective. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations and the cadence for the remainder of the year just particularly in light of some of the commentary regarding slower smartphone shipments? So, that\u2019s kind of the near-term question. And the longer term question is maybe we can talk about this in the context of your portfolio, Inge, you have done a lot to restructure your portfolio since you took over. I am just curious like whether this is a business that you are going to continue to reevaluate as we move forward? Inge Thulin : Well, good morning, Joe. Well, first of all, it was a little bit \u2013 the slowest business for us in the quarter, but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day when we talked about it in terms of what we expected for the first quarter. Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was I would say is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So, from that perspective not a surprise for us, but I think as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid to high single growth down. And I think for the year, low to mid single. So, I think that\u2019s how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us, because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace and we have worked on that business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years. And as you can see, here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So, I will say, first of all, all businesses, portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong is just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly and I think that\u2019s what we are doing here again, right. But for me and for us, it\u2019s more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And maybe my second question and turning it to the Health Care group where you saw accelerating organic growth, the margin is now approaching 33%. Maybe talk a little bit about the expectations for that business now. Have they been ratcheted up at all as we progress through the year and should we start thinking about this business as being a 32% to 33% type margin business moving forward? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all, you are correct relative to the performance of Health Care over many, many years, right. This is a very good business for us and very solid fundamentals. And I think it\u2019s very much based on the value creation for both the providers and the patient in that market. We will \u2013 you saw this quarter again very solid organic local currency growth, margin expansion, and is broad-based. It\u2019s both in developed and developing markets and you have seen all businesses. And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So, it\u2019s not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio investing is we will invest in all the businesses. And as I laid out, it is around research and development, it\u2019s about health economics, and it\u2019s about commercialization capabilities. Those three things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field starts to open up for us, because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products around the world. So, we have a very strong position there. And you can think about this in terms of our fastest growing business with the highest margin and we are pleased with the margins, but we are not \u2013 we will accelerate the investment there to get growth up even further. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks, Inge. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just a question firstly on Industrial and Safety and Graphics, if you have seen any change in demand trends as you went through the quarter in China and in developed markets? Nick Gangestad : Julian, good morning. For both China and in U.S. and in Europe, as the quarter went on, we saw no discernible change in the trends. It was a pretty consistent performance throughout the quarter. Julian Mitchell : Got it. Thank you very much. Inge Thulin : Yes, the comment on China, we saw again both Consumer and Health Care with very solid growth in China in this quarter. So, that\u2019s again a good indication relative to what is happening in those markets as they are type of expanding their businesses specifically in China. They are not shifting, but they are expanding into more domestic driven businesses. And we saw terrific growth, both in consumer and Health Care in China. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just my second moment beyond Electronics and Energy, if you are seeing any price pressure there or it\u2019s all just volume declines. And also you talked about some portfolio changes recently, should we expect therefore that the energy related business could grow this year, actually within that segment? Nick Gangestad : Julian, first on the price front, we haven\u2019t seen any change in the trajectory on pricing. It\u2019s been pretty flat as it was last year and into this year. No real changes on the pricing, selling price environment that we are seeing on the electronics side. In regards to portfolio movement actions, as I said on the energy side, we took a portfolio action within our renewable energy business in the fourth quarter, which is having a negative impact on our first quarter organic growth. That negative impact will continue throughout all four quarters of 2016 and it\u2019s incorporated into our guidance for the total business and the company. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Inge Thulin : Thanks Steven. Steven Winoker : Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing raw material dynamic in terms of how that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still huge even though it\u2019s diminishing, what are your expectations for that going forward and as part of that, how much of that pricing was currency related this quarter? Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. For the first quarter the combination of price raw material, that benefited our margin by 110 basis points. The vast majority of that coming from lower raw material prices. And on the raw materials side, we are continuing to expect our tailwinds, driven by lower commodity prices and with a heavier weighting to the first half of the year than the second half. Regarding selling prices, we have traditionally been able to achieve about 30 basis points of underlying price growth when we strip out FX. We continue to see that as our capability and we project that we will be at that type of core price growth in our company for the year. If I look at the price growth that we had in the first quarter of 90 basis points, all of that came in our international operations and the majority of that 90 basis points was in response to our pricing actions in response to FX movements, the majority of that 90 basis points coming from FX reaction. Steven Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the M&A that you have done Capital Safety, etcetera, what was the organic growth of those businesses, what were they achieving from an organic basis? Nick Gangestad : On an organic basis, well first of all, I will just level set the facts here that what they are adding to 3M\u2019s total growth, our total acquisitions before divestitures added 2.1% to 3M\u2019s growth and our divestitures reduced 3M\u2019s revenue by 50 basis points. So we had a net 160 basis points growth. Underlying that within our Capital Safety business organically, we continued to see strong revenue performance across the board for that business, with the exception of the oil and gas market that the Capital Safety market serves. In our Membrana business, that business continues to perform well. But from an organic basis, we typically start measuring the organic once we lapped ourselves 12 months after we acquired it, Steve. Steven Winoker : No, I know. I am just looking for what the actual \u2013 what they are running at organically so that when they do lap 12 months, which should be in the third quarter, how much it\u2019s going to add, that\u2019s we are going to trying get to? Nick Gangestad : Low single-digits would be our best estimate right now. Steven Winoker : Okay, fantastic. And if I could just one last, you guys holding the 1% to 3%, what are you actually taking up since Electronics and Energy are down? Inge Thulin : We are not changing our guidance at this point in time. Steven Winoker : Right, so there must be some other business that\u2019s higher, I guess? Inge Thulin : Yes, correct. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Steve, we continue to see our other four businesses solidly in the range that we laid out in December and they will help propel our company to the guidance we put out of 1% to 3%. Steven Winoker : Fantastic. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Can you give us a sense, I mean Inge you talked about China a little bit, but can you walk around the world and just talk about what\u2019s getting better or what\u2019s getting worse out there and geographically? Inge Thulin : I don\u2019t think since we met at Investor Day that there being any big changes in the marketplaces. With maybe one slight exception which is Europe, Middle East, Africa. I think that\u2019s, honestly was a little bit of surprise that we saw slightly better growth there than we had expected. I think that\u2019s the change that from a material perspective, if you like, that have changed. That on the positive side, because I think we have to look for positive sides within Latin America, we had \u2013 we continue very good growth in Mexico, but we were positive in Brazil as well. So I think Brazil then by definition is one country. I think that\u2019s something that we could see changing. But more than that, I don\u2019t see any change. Central Europe, East Europe is doing well. West Europe was actually, as I have said a slight surprise. Nothing changed in Asia, nothing changed for us in the United States either. So I think it was very solid and no absolute downs in terms of, I think specifically that was negative that came after as I see it, there were some slight positives, if you like. Scott Davis : Okay. I know this is hard to dial down to this kind of detail, but when you think about the 150 basis points full year guide on margins, how much of that are you guys thinking as price cost? Nick Gangestad : Price for raw materials Scott, we for the year, we have been expecting that to be 50 basis points and we still see ourselves lining up closely with that. Scott Davis : Okay. And just a quick one, is your price now fully caught up to currency dislocations in 3M? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Going forward, where the dollar is right now, I think the majority of our price increases due to FX are behind us especially as the dollar stays where it is. Scott Davis : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, guys. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning John. Nick Gangestad : Good morning John. John Inch : Good morning guys. Hi Inge, your history of being able to raise pricing 30 basis points a year may not help you much if these raw costs, metals, gas, oil keep climbing the way they do, you put up very impressive margins, I am just \u2013 what\u2019s your play book for offsetting a potential margin squeeze if you could draw on history and your own thoughts towards being able to raise pricing more than you have in your history to offset some of these cost increases that seem to be about to hit us all? Nick Gangestad : Yes. John, I will take that one. The 30 basis points is when we look over a long period of time of what our capability has been. And it\u2019s been fairly sustainable. In times of commodity price increases that tends to go up slightly, in times of commodity price declines that tends to go down. But it\u2019s fairly constant within 3M. To answer your question John, I would like to take you back to our Investor Day. As we look to the next few years of where we will be driving our efficient growth and potential for margin expansion, we are really driving many of our initiatives to be able to do that. Our initiatives around business transformation, one of our key levers, actions we are taking with our footprint to better optimize our efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing supply chain. That I see is the heart of what we will be doing in the coming years to continue our ability to grow efficiently and part of that involves margin expansion. John Inch : Okay. So you basically, Nick, are saying that it\u2019s highly probable you are going to get behind on raw costs versus price increases, but there is just ample productivity within 3M and you are taking more restructuring obviously in E&E that you feel good about just being able to offset it. Is that kind of it? Nick Gangestad : Yes, I am not \u2013 I think I am not ready to say and I don\u2019t think it would be accurate to say that we see ourselves flipping over to the negative on the price raws, but it has been a noticeable benefit to us for the last 2 plus years. We are not planning for it to be as positive for us as it has been and we are relying more on other productivity initiatives to fuel our efficiency and our growth. John Inch : That\u2019s fair. I am just trying to get ahead of this. Second question is really on your own guidance had, if I am not mistaken, assume that the economy generally, loosely defined I guess the industrial economy was going to meaningfully pick up in the second half? Your industrial and E&E numbers are not \u2013 is showing that. Parker\u2019s numbers are actually, their orders are worse. There is a very mixed reporting season in terms of the economy cadence, right. China is good, but I am talking kind of North America and other points. Inge, are you still holding to the fact that you think numbers can get better in the second half? I realize you got a lot of margin embedded, so that\u2019s I am not so worried about your numbers. I just want your commentary around your thoughts for the U.S. industrial economy? Inge Thulin : Yes, we do. I think that we look upon our total portfolio, right. As I said earlier, this change we see is the weaker near-term demand in consumer electronics and maybe that it will persist a little bit longer than we thought. So, if you take that as a given that is the change, I would say, but we see in Industrial that, that model is still working for us and we are sticking to the plan as we go for the year. And three of that are businesses will compensate for what I will say a delay of the growth rate coming in the second part for electronics part of our business. So, there is no change down. I don\u2019t see that change coming either to be honest. I have not seen that as of yet. I see there is a slight strength, actually, coming both for Safety and Graphics, Consumer and Health Care and Industrial stay very much as we laid out as we met the last time and then it looked like that there will be a little bit longer persistent in the consumer electronic part as we thought just 2 months ago also. John Inch : That\u2019s right. So, in other words, Industrial are flat and other businesses are doing a little bit better. One last thing, Nick, this accounting change, you say you are basically going to offset it with I am assuming cash repatriation on which you pay taxes. How does that \u2013 does that like you give a sense of how that\u2019s going to breakout over the next three quarters? And if you don\u2019t do that, have you actually given yourselves somewhat favorably a $0.10 tailwind? Well, I guess it\u2019s the accounting change, but does this accounting change create a $0.10 tailwind heading into \u201817 because you may not repatriate for whatever next year, so that\u2019s just how the math works? Nick Gangestad : John, a couple of points on that. As far as the actions we are taking to optimize our global cash position, I don\u2019t want you to think of it as a one-time event. This is a continuation of ongoing efforts we do in our company to efficiently and effectively manage our cash positions. And as you look at our balance sheet, our amount of our global cash has been declining. And we are always looking for how we can move cash to improve our efficiency and effectiveness as well as reduce the risk in holding that cash. It\u2019s been an ongoing effort. We are going to continue to do it. It did give us an opportunity to take some actions and repatriation, John, as part of that. In terms of setting up another $0.10 tailwind into 2017, I think that would be going too far. I think it continues to position us well for \u201817, but I wouldn\u2019t think of it all as a tailwind going into \u201817. John Inch : But is the $0.10 equally spread I know for the next three quarters in your tax line, Nick? Nick Gangestad : Yes, John, it is. Over the next three quarters, we expect to average approximately a 31% tax rate. But as you know and as you look at our results, there is fluctuation. Some quarters will be higher and some lower, but over the next three quarters, averaging around 31%. John Inch : Okay, got it. Thanks very much. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : So, if you look at your breakdown of price you look at the U.S. pricing, you didn\u2019t get any price in the U.S. this quarter. You got 0.6 last quarter and really you have averaged that usual 30 to 50 basis points over the last year in the U.S. Are you seeing any more competition in the U.S.? Is there any more of an issue in any particular segment in the U.S.? Did something change that it might get tougher to get your usual 30 to 50 basis points in the U.S.? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andy, I will take that one. We are not seeing a big change. There are certain parts of our business in the U.S. where we continue to face good competition and we react with price, but I would call those pockets, not widespread. Sometimes with pricing, in particular in the U.S., we saw actions to capture more market share and adjust pricing. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s leading to that 0% that we posted in price in the U.S. for the first quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : Nick, do you think you could still average that 30 to 50 as you go over the next year or? Nick Gangestad : Of underlying price capability... Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, in the U.S. Nick Gangestad : We still see that 30 basis points as a good reflection of our underlying capability there. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And Inge, if I could ask you again about Safety and Graphics, I mean, it picked up nicely in 1Q in terms of growth versus 4Q, but we know you had a very difficult comp in 4Q. So, did you actually see a pickup in personal safety or was it mostly just easier comps working their magic and how do we look at this business going forward? Inge Thulin : Yes. No, we saw a pickup in personal safety. So, I think you have to look upon it in a couple of ways. First of all, if you think about your position in the market, when you add an acquisition like Capital Safety, you will strengthen your position big time in that whole personal safety space. So, I will say that in my view this is only the beginning of something big that will come for us, because our relevance in that whole personal safety segmentation has increased very, very much. And so I will say there is clear evidence for us that we moved our positions forward and that \u2013 so it\u2019s not based on easier comp only. That was an easier comp. But we can also see we start to take better positions both for respirators and now for protection. Andrew Kaplowitz : Inge, maybe its better market share even than better market, is that fair? Inge Thulin : Sorry. Andrew Kaplowitz : Is it better market than improved market, is that fair? Inge Thulin : Market share, yes, market share, but you have also to look upon it in terms of segmentation that you expand with Capital Safety and as you expand for 3M, expand with Capital Safety, some \u2013 of course, all of our other product portfolios is going with that. So, we are becoming much stronger in that position totally. That business there in Safety and Graphics that is doing very, very well for us is Commercial Solutions that again showed 4% organic local currency growth and have now for many, many quarters, really, really performed well for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : For Nick, it seemed that the dollar is now beginning to be less of a headwind for you guys. Would you consider changing or ramping back your hedging plans? If I recall you had moved from a 12-month to a 24-month hedging maybe that\u2019s not as required at this stage, have you given that some thought? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Dean, thanks for the question. The short answer is no, but a little longer answer is our hedging philosophy is meant to help us reduce some of our volatility and allow time for the businesses to adjust to a sustained change in currencies. It\u2019s not to eliminate all the risk. And our objective there, we use oftentimes natural hedges and when we can\u2019t do that then we use financial hedges to offset some of that risk. Our strategy of using hedging and we hedge approximately 50% of that exposure, most currencies out 1 year and then a few selected currencies out second year and third year. That philosophy isn\u2019t changing. We are going to continue to do that. And it really lines up with our philosophy of how we think about hedging over time to help take some of that risk and give our businesses time to react. Deane Dray : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Nick were there be divestiture gains in the quarter? Nick Gangestad : Yes, there were. There we \u2013 we divested of our Polyfoam business during the first quarter and of the $0.07 related to M&A, approximately one half of that $0.07 was coming from gains on divestitures. Deane Dray : Got it. And then for the charge expected in the second quarter, that\u2019s all headcount related, the payback on that, what\u2019s the expected payback on that charge? Nick Gangestad : We expect that charge to pay for itself by the end of this year. Deane Dray : And do you contemplate other actions in electronics over the near-term? Inge Thulin : No, not at this point in time, Deane. Deane Dray : Okay. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up on the sort of $0.03 Nick from gains, where did that land, was that in the segment? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, the Polyfoam business is in our Industrial business. And that resulted in about half, approximately approaching half of that $0.07 benefit that we saw for the total company. By the way, it was also part of the overall guidance when we guided for the year, that we expected $0.10 of benefits from M&A. The sale of our Polyfoam business was included in that estimate. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks. And then it seems that showed us to pick on margins just given the overall strength in margins, but they were down 20 bps and you have given the tailwinds from pension and growth, it does look and I see there is higher upsides in there, but is there mix there, is there the pricing, can you maybe add a bit more color on Consumer margins this quarter? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, the primary thing you are seeing there is that we continue to see good opportunities in our consumer business. And we are investing for continued growth. So it\u2019s some key investments that we are choosing to make now that we think will propel this into even stronger position in the future. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then I know in the business you are giving quarterly guidance, but your comments around 1Q back in January were very helpful and getting our models balanced, so I am just wondering if maybe you could add some color on 2Q, how you see organic sales developing into 2Q? Nick Gangestad : Yes. For the second quarter, we do see organic growth being slightly better than what we saw in Q1 for the total company. And we are also continuing to estimate that the second half is going to be stronger than the first half. In particular, in Electronics and Energy, we are expecting that second quarter organic growth is going to be a decline in the mid to high single-digits. So it will go from approximately 12% decline in the first quarter to a mid to high single-digit decline in the second quarter. And then for the year we are expecting Electronics and Energy to be down low to mid single-digits. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning Jeff. Nick Gangestad : Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Just a couple of really quick ones, just on tax planning, Nick, obviously you have had an aspiration to drive your tax rate down, my sense is a lot of that\u2019s been the hubs and [indiscernible] and other thing. But is there anything on what the Treasury recently pronounced that kind of thwarts your ambitions to bring the tax rate down over the next couple of years? Nick Gangestad : Jeff no, the recent actions being taken there do not thwart our efforts to bring us to a 27% tax rate by 2020. We are continuing to evaluate those proposals and the impact they could have on 3M, but we don\u2019t contemplate that they would have a material impact on us at this time. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just a quick one on Health Care, was R&D actually up in the quarter, I ask that in that R&D was actually down overall for the company, so the comments about increased investment, is that more about ambition and outlook for the rest of the year or does R&D actually moving up in Health Care in the first quarter? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all, when we say we will accelerate our investments in terms of both R&D, hence economics and commercialization. That is when we move forward. Our intent on the company level in order to accelerate investment in R&D is happening, right. The 5.5% we are close to 6% at this point in time. So we are moving forward. And we are moving forward in all groups we say. So the answer is yes and acceleration will happen in Health Care specifically. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey, Inge, Health Care and consumer, two businesses you have been trying to grow more in developing market from their historic position, you highlighted both the growth in developing market for both in this quarter, I am just wondering if you feel like you are reaching some kind of a tipping point there or maybe just a little bit of what you are seeing going on there? Inge Thulin : Tipping point in terms of more growth coming? Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: In terms of more developing market traction for consumer and Healthcare? Inge Thulin : Yes. I think both are strengthening their positions. And the way we should think about this is in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition will go faster in Health Care than in consumer. And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity in consumer take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the two of them, we will see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus consumer. But both of them are growing very, very well. And I would not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time. And it\u2019s often realization of change of brand equity position for consumer. And then it\u2019s a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced and is very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide. So that\u2019s what we believe, that both Health Care and consumer has great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look upon our mix, those are also two of our businesses that mix in the portfolio, that we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those two businesses. So the future look good, it\u2019s up to us now to execute and do that as fast as possible. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. And just maybe some comments on what the M&A pipeline looks like until we lacked anything of size this year? Inge Thulin : It looks good. All business groups have a good pipeline. We are constantly looking into that. I would say that when you think about what we have done the last year that you saw we did fewer, but more sizable versus the past and very strategically relative to our portfolio, that is what you should expect from 3M going forward. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, thanks. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : So thanks for the revenue color on the second quarter there. I guess the moving parts kind of sequentially with tax going up obviously and then you have the charge I guess which is going to flow through Electronics and Energy, so a normal seasonality would get you to something in kind of a 2.10 to 2.15 range, I would assume that these items bring you perhaps a little bit lower than that given what you pulled into the first quarter, is that kind of the right way to think about it. And then just the margin, year-over-year margin, I guess another way to ask the question would be what are the major differences in the year-over-year margin bridge given that the utilization and other should probably still be with you, you have the extra restructuring. Just maybe a little bit of color on the bottom line dynamics to help size us for the second quarter? Nick Gangestad : Okay. So, for the second quarter, Steve, I have shared much about the second quarter already. I would say about what we are expecting for total growth in Electronics and Energy, you noted the charge we are taking in our Electronics and Energy business. I think the only other thing on the margin I will point out is corporate and unallocated, I have guided that we expect that to be between $150 million and $200 million for the year first quarter right in line with that. As we look at the seasonality, we expect a corporate and unallocated for the year. We think that will stay right in that range. I do see Q2 as the highest quarter for our expense we will be incurring in corporate and unallocated and then moderating going into Q3 and Q4. In regards to margin for Q2, as it look Q2 and for the total year, Steve, FX and raw materials are a couple of things that are a little better than how we started the year thinking. And though I see those partially offsetting what we are seeing from lower utilization of our electronics and industrial assets in the first half of the year. Steve Tusa : Okay. So year-over-year, a little bit of a better lift on margins in the second quarter is what you are saying? Nick Gangestad : As I look at our total guidance for the year, we expect margins up about 150 basis points. We were at $130 million in the first quarter. As I look across the whole year, fourth quarter is, Steve, where we expect the most margin expansion where we had the restructuring charge in fourth quarter of last year. The second and third quarter I would put below the mean for the year for margin expansion. Steve Tusa : Below the mean for the year. Okay, got it. So, can you get this, I mean, I think I am kind of walking these moving parts down. I mean, it seems like there is something roughly around $2. Is that kind of the right area for you guys? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Steve, we give guidance for the year, $8.10 to $8.45 is the right guidance for the year. I am not going to try to guide the EPS for the quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay, I had to try. Thanks a lot. Inge Thulin : Thank you, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I guess two longer term questions on the Electronics and Energy segment. Are you happy with the prospects for accelerating growth through better R&D the same way as you expressed on Health Care? And then related to that as you look at the longer term strategic options for those businesses, are your options constrained by the degree to which our R&D backbone across the business is integrated, so that you don\u2019t want to source an IP to exit the company that might affect the other segments? Inge Thulin : Well, let\u2019s start with the first question. In a way, they are maybe related, right. So, you are talking about research and development, investment into that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is if you think about the Electronics, very much of that is spec-ins right. So, we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That\u2019s actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So, we have two processes in the company, one called Idea 2 Innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables and then you have customer inspired innovation, which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So, if that is in aerospace, that is in automotive, if that\u2019s consumer electronics or wherever that it is right into one specific customer. The strengths of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don\u2019t work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer inspired innovation. And if you don\u2019t come to a solution, you kill it very early. So, I am very confident in that model and that is why that is a very good business from 3M, because we can provide through our technology platforms multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. So, the answer to that is very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust of course based on what they are requiring. So, that\u2019s an important element on the Electronic side. On the Energy side, it\u2019s a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, etcetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and when you get the input from customer panels, etcetera. So, the business is always built on research and development and that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able to generate very good returns to our investors, because we are not commoditized. We don\u2019t work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it. Laurence Alexander : Okay, thank you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge Thulin : To wrap up, we had a strong start to the year highlighted by good earnings, margins and cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to execute the 3M playbook to drive efficient growth and create even greater value for customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you very soon. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, July 26, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2016 Business Review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 25 and January 24. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, scheduled for December 13. More details will be available as we get closer to that date. Today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide three and I'll hand it off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year over year. Organic sales were down slightly, at minus 20 basis points. Our two domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth, with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas. And Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete, and Post-it products. Safety & Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight, low-single digits. Organic growth in Electronics & Energy declined in the high-single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics market. Acquisitions net of divestitures added more than 1 percentage point to our sales, while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amount. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter. In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year over year. Four of our five business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety & Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength. Our ability to generate premium returns along with strong free cash flow enables us to consistently invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on Business Transformation, which is one of our three key levers. At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about Customer First, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including Business Transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To-date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our Business Transformation, in a dozen countries as well as in four of our largest European distribution centers. Most recently, in the second quarter we had two successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our three Global Service Centers located in Costa Rica, Poland, and Philippines. Through these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future. Business Transformation is strengthening our company; it starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result at $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments on slide four with a summary of our Q2 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter, with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of three small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015. Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4%, with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely, Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety & Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business. In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy as we continued to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China/Hong Kong down 2%. Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 4.8%, with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%. Please turn to slide five for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year on year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points. Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in Electronics and, to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points, as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year. Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. Let's now turn to slide six for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $40 million, or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year on year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS. Please turn to slide seven for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation. Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year on year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on slide eight. Our Industrial business group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Looking across our Industrial business group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds. We also posted mid-single digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year on year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objectives since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with two life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%. Please turn to slide nine. Safety & Graphics delivered a solid quarter, with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter, with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of two small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged two of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable self-rescue fall protection device. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined year on year. Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions along with solid productivity efforts. Please turn to slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up year on year. By geography, Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific each posted high-single digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high-single digit organic growth in developing countries, with strong contributions from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems, and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year over year and margins remain strong, at 32.7%. Next I will cover Electronics & Energy on slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the Electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronics applications. At the same time, channel inventories continue to adjust and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year. Our Energy-related businesses declined 2% organically, with growth in Telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia-Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics. Second quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $229 million, with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2 we took actions within Electronics & Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics & Energy to decline by high-single digits. Please turn to slide 12, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painter's tape continue to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter. In our Consumer Health Care business, we're driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces, and supports. The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-it and Command solutions. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million, with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter. That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. Six months into the year, four of our five business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics & Energy is growing below those expectations. As a result, today we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year on year. We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2% versus the prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus the previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. Finally, there is no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Andrew. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So your price versus raw materials actually went up in 2Q to 1.3% from 1.1% in 1Q. We know you've talked about your benefit from price versus raw materials actually being front-half loaded this year, but pricing's been trending a little higher than you thought. Raw materials, have they still been a little lower than you thought? You did get positive pricing in the U.S. after nothing last quarter and really after you spoke about increased competitive environment in the U.S. So did you see an improvement in the pricing environment in the U.S. in particular? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Andy, there's several things you're asking there. For the second quarter and then I'll expand it to talk about the total year for price raw materials, we, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130 basis points, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 basis points is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement. Our total price growth that we posted this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business and we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 basis points and 50 basis points. So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. Six months ago I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points, but we're seeing some improvement in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's helpful, Nick. And, Inge, when you look at the goals that you set out at the Analyst Day, the 2% to 5% organic growth over the next several years, $500 million to $700 million in business transformation, $125 million to $175 million of factory optimization, then you think about the current environment where you may record pretty marginal organic growth this year, does it change your urgency at all around your cost-out initiatives? Can you accelerate these initiatives at all or find more cost out if we're in a lower for longer growth environment? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we are focusing on that the whole time, as you know. And answer to it, yes, of course, we have to do it if that is what will be demanded. Now, we are very early, as you know, into that five-year plan. Basically two quarters. But I think we have to look upon it as we roll out if there's something that needs to be done in specific segments or pockets. And if you look upon it today, four of our five business groups are, at this point in time, just in line with the expectation we had for this year. The one that have a challenge based on end markets is Electronics & Energy. And we have done a lot in that business group the last couple of years. So it's like \u2013 it's not a surprise for us that there are changes in that market. We have addressed it the whole time. And we will do that everywhere as we go ahead. But when I look upon it in terms of how solid the four business groups are executing the plan at this point in time, I hope that we don't need to take drastic action in those businesses. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Inge. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Joe. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Inge, maybe just touch on China for a second. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong was down 2% this quarter. So it seems like you're seeing some weakness across some of your other businesses. So maybe talk a little bit about that. And also across the portfolio, if you can just touch on touch on trends, whether trends got better or worse as the quarter progressed. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think, first of all, in total China, in our portfolio there based on how that has been built over the years based on the China market, which was, I would say, very much related initially to export for them, we have a bigger portion there which is Electronics and Industrial. And for reasons that we know relative to that market have been slower, maybe the last two years now when we start to look upon it, nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in Electronics. Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth, and Health Care, 11% growth. So if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead. China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, for six quarters we have focused a lot on productivity improvements. So underlining results in China is good for us. We need to get more growth as that market turns around. The encouraging thing is that domestic businesses is going very, very well for us at this point in time. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the underlying trends, did things get better or worse as the quarter progressed? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't know about the quarter specifically. But in my view, we will see, based on comp as well, we will see China do slightly better as we move ahead. But think about China for the year flat as we end up the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then maybe, Nick, one follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes, especially as we get into 4Q on the margin side. It looks like your margins can be up at least 250 basis points, 300 basis points because you did all those restructuring actions in 4Q of last year. So maybe step us through the puts and takes for 4Q. I just want to make sure I have them straight. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Oh, for just fourth quarter? Yeah. The biggest put and take in the fourth quarter will be the comparison to fourth quarter last year, which had a restructuring. Other puts and takes will continue to be getting benefits from price raw materials. Strategic investments, as I've mentioned earlier, will be larger in the second half than it was in the first half, so that'll be part of the puts and takes. But the biggest driver that's going to change is going to be the year-on-year impact of not repeating the restructuring that we had in fourth quarter of 2015. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And we can go through the color offline. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Rob. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Rob. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, a couple questions specifically on your European exposure. Obviously, you had very strong results, particularly led by Western Europe in the quarter. But given recent geopolitical events, Brexit, et cetera, could you speak as to what you've been seeing in your shorter cycle businesses there? And then the follow-up, and there won't be a follow-up from here so it will just be two parts and I will get off the phone, is just longer term, as you think about your ERP and other initiatives and potential SKU rationalization, do you have to rethink that in the context of an extended break-up of the eurozone? In other words, will you have to change your long-term strategy there? Because there is a strategy for further cost take-out, but I think the tacit assumption is continued economic integration of the eurozone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Inge. So, first of all, UK for us is less than 3% as an enterprise in terms of revenue. And we had a very good result this quarter in West Europe, as you saw, with 3% organic local currency growth with all business groups growing, which is very, very nice to see, to be honest. So we had Industrial at 3%, we had SGBG 2%, we had Health Care, 5%, we had EEBG 5%, and we had Consumer 2%. If you think about Europe and put that in perspective with what we have to do, there's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe. Our strategy has always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And, number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for long time in order to reduce the layers in organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over three years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the cost very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country. There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well. And as I said before, when some of you have asked around which business group can add more margin expansion to you as we move forward, the answer has always been all of them, because all of them are part of West Europe. And West Europe's margins are now starting to increase in a nice way. So we're very pleased with the performance there. There is issues in Europe. But you know what? There's issues everywhere around the world. And you have just to stay the course and adjust if you need. But the Brexit short-term for us doesn't mean anything, to be honest, based on our operation. And I don't see a reason at this point in time to change the laid-out plan we have for Europe. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Just on the buyback, as you said, I think you spent around $2 billion in the first half. I see you're running at sort of the low end of the full year placeholder. Is there anything interesting in that? Or is it the fact that the share price obviously bounced a decent amount from where you were buying in Q1? Should we read anything into your M&A appetite? And maybe just touch on how you're thinking about M&A right now, because it's been a while since things like Capital Safety were enacted. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Julian, I don't think you should over-read it. We started the year and we continue to have a range of $4 billion to $6 billion. And with $2.1 billion through the first half of the year, we're currently tracking to the low end of the range. The pace and the amount of the repurchases is dependent on demands of capital, such as for M&A, and it's also dependent on the relative value we see in the stock price. Our model is sensitive to share price. And the range that we put out allows flexibility with our capital allocation decisions. So in short, I'd say, Julian, don't over-read anything in our $4 billion to $6 billion range. We're just holding to that right now partly because there's a lot of uncertainties that can happen in the second half of the year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the margin guide for the year. Apologies if I missed it. But are you still guiding for about 150 bps of increase for the year? And then just a quick corollary of that would be should we think that Q2's increase of 50 bps year-on-year is the low point in terms of margin increase and Q3 should see a bigger increase year-on-year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Julian, for the year, we're in the range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin expansion. Some puts and takes in there. The price raw materials we're seeing is slightly better than we did at the beginning of the year. And the lower volume and related lower utilization of assets is the negative impacting that margin. So 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year. We consider the first and the fourth quarter to be the quarters with the most margin expansion and second and third quarter to be the two lower quarters of margin expansion. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. So obviously the biggest delta on full year guidance at the top line is due to E&E. I think I understand that. I think, Inge, you mentioned that all of the four segments are tracking in line with plan. Obviously, Industrial's tracking a bit lower than the 0% to 3% year-to-date. Do you still see a credible path back to positive growth in Industrial in the back half of the year? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yes, I do. And part of that is, of course, how we will be compared to last year. But we see us performing better in the second half of the year in Industrial versus we have done in the first part of the year. We had a challenge this quarter specifically in United States for Industrial, and that will come back as we move forward into Q3 and Q4. When you look upon the guidance in total, we see Health Care and Consumer continue to perform very well. The same with Safety & Graphics, which I've talked about earlier, is the business that will be the next breakout business. And I think we saw it this quarter that it's now coming full speed. And then Electronics & Energy, as we have talked about, will be, as Nick said and I said as well, we will see decline for the year in that business to high single digits. And then Industrial, I think due to the comparison, will do slightly better for us. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, the comp will get easier in 4Q for sure. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But we have put the guidance now 0% to 1% for the company. It's very much related to Electric & Energy (sic) [Electronics & Energy] (41:12). Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And then for Nick, UTX just sort of softly cautioned on pension for next year based on where those current rates are today. You're obviously very pension sensitive as well. I'm just wondering if you snap a line today on discount rates, what sort of pension headwind could we be looking at next year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, for our pension expense, if we snapped the rates right now, it would become a headwind for us in 2017. It's really too early with five and a half more months to go before that gets set, so I'm not going to comment on the magnitude of it. But if we stopped right now, it would be a headwind for us in 2017. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, all. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Steven. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just to put a finer point on the answer to Nigel's question. I guess this is the third quarter of negative organic growth. Do you actually \u2013 if you think about next quarter versus the fourth quarter, are you expecting growth to at least \u2013 organic local currency growth to go positive in the third quarter still? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, Steven, let me take that one. As we progress through the year, third quarter, we could be similar to what we saw in the second quarter for organic growth to slightly better. We'll see, as Inge mentioned, improving trends in Industrial more driven by comps. But we will continue to see declines in our Electronics & Energy business. The fourth quarter, based in our view right now, is where we'll see the most significant year-on-year comp benefits for our organic growth, which will propel us into the 0% to 1% range. But the third quarter I wouldn't be looking for a dramatic turnaround from the growth rates that we've seen in the second quarter. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just one detail point. How much did you actually end up spending then on restructuring compared to that $20 million placeholder you had talked about? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, three months ago I said that we expected that expense to be approximately $20 million. As we progressed through the quarter, we executed on all the actions we planned, the price tag for that came in closer to $10 million than to $20 million. We found some ways to do it more efficiently so it ended up being a slight benefit from what we were thinking. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But with the same payback dollars? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Exact same payback that we're expecting. This will pay for itself this year. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just remind us where you guys stand on the foreign exchange hedging. I know that there's a bit of a carryover some years. If you just held the line at $1.10, would you have any kind of carryover from hedging next year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : As we go into next year, Steve, if things just stayed where they were, the biggest impact we'd have on our earnings in 2017 would be the diminishment of our hedging gains. So we're experiencing hedging gains this year of approximately $100 million. If FX did not move, that $100 million would drop substantially. There'd still be slight gains in 2017, but minimal. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just on the pension, just remind us what the sensitivity is. You don't have to give us a number for next year. But just every 25 bps, what's the expense headwind? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : This is a little dated, Steve. But at one time, the sensitivity was about $1 million for every basis point. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. On the Safety & Graphics margins, a lot going your way this quarter. Capital Safety, looked like roofing granules had a good quarter. But you talked about it as the next breakout business, too, Inge. So I'm just trying to figure out with margins up here 27% plus, is this a particularly favorable quarter mix-wise in other things? Or is this a ramp that we expect to continue? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, first of all, we have done a lot in that business relative to the portfolio. And it's an ongoing process. And I think that is now what we see the benefit on. When we started that process quite some years back when we start really to look upon what we call underperforming businesses, which is the standard is very high, as you know, inside of 3M when you're running at those type of margins. I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group. And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plates that was not strategically important. And, by the way, we are not a converter in that industry. So I think that when you start to add things together with building out the strength in position with addition of Capital Safety to our Personal Safety business and then you look upon the whole Graphics side and the Transportation side in terms of the work they have done in order to work on the mix, that is the outcome of the result. We expect this business to continue to grow and accelerate growth, in fact. And we should be able to run the margins around this area at this point in time as we move forward. And, please \u2013 our leader there, Frank Little, he had told me that he's very confident that he can do that. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on Electronics. So the weak volumes and the excess inventory has been going on for a long time. Looks like they're going to continue. And when do you expect Electronics to return to growth? And are you still comfortable with the strategic positioning there beyond the near-term volume challenges? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, to start with your last question, the answer is yes. And the Electronic business is a good business for us to be in. We're a material science company and the strengths of our capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me. And when you look upon the four fundamentals that we have in the company in terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us. And as we all know, in terms of Electronics, it's growing generally speaking. And we are all touched by it every day in what we do. So that is what 3M should be. So the answer to that question is, yes, it is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also has an upside and we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we will see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait until some time in 2017 before we will see growth, specifically in consumer electronic taking place. Now, there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis points in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter. So despite pressure on volume, the structure is done now to be able to deliver around 20% of operating income for the company. For me, that's good. So I compliment their team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation. And they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it 2016. But 2017 will soon be here anyhow. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. If I look at your margin walk, organic volume was a big drag. And as I look historically, I think it's the biggest one I have in a while. Can you just talk about the fact that given the organic growth was close to zero, why the volume drag was so big? I would imagine it relates to the consumer electronics business in Asia. But is that what we should expect going forward, the disproportionate impact? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Andrew. I'll take that. As you look at our margin walk for Q2, what we're calling that is organic volume and utilization. And that's a little different from how it was last quarter where we had those two separated out. So what's driving the utilization negative impact? First of all, having the organic growth down 20 basis points. That's part of that. We also saw \u2013 we reduced our inventories in the second quarter, which has little lower throughput through our manufacturing facilities. And then the third and probably most significant of these is lower asset utilization in our Electronics business and, to a lesser extent, in our Industrial business. Those are the main things going on. During the second half, we expect the asset utilization to improve, but not necessarily to be positive impact on the margin. It will improve, and that's aligned with our expectation full year operating margin expansion for the year being between 100 basis points and 150 basis points. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just a follow-up question on Health Care. You're posting 5% organic growth. Can you just talk about your internal efforts to dedicate more resources internally to Health Care? How sustainable is this growth? If there is a structural change in the rate of growth now that you dedicate more assets internally? And is there ability to dedicate even more resources to accelerate this growth? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Inge. We had made a commitment many years back to accelerate the investment in Health Care. And that is what is paying off. And when I look across every geographical area in every sense we are growing \u2013 when I look up on the sheet that I have in front of me for Health Care, we are growing every place around the world except for in Brazil. And it's very remarkable in a way that the way we're able to take market share and grow in most of the segments. And, again, food safety led the growth with 12% in the quarter and it's broad based. And the same is going for the oral care business, it's growing very well. So there's a broad base for us in terms of growth. And we are, as you'll recall, we decided to not only keep Health Information Systems, but also accelerate investment into that business. So it's a very high priority for us. And we are making investment in most, if not all, of the divisions there as we move ahead. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Deane. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Nick. Can we start with you on the tax expectation that you've lowered it slightly? Last quarter, we talked about tax would be actually higher in the back half of the year. You were going to do some repatriating of cash. Are you still doing that? Is this a net effect? And where does the cash repatriation stand today? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Deane, when I guided last quarter, our expectation for tax rate for the remaining quarters of the year and for the total year, it was also at a time that we had adopted the new accounting standard on the way tax benefits are treated on the income statement related to employee stock-based compensation. Our view at that time was the majority of that benefit would be coming in the first quarter and that with our cash repatriation plans we'd be seeing a higher tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarter. As far as the cash movement, that continues according to our plan. The difference that we saw during the second quarter is due to the strong 3M stock performance, we saw increased benefit coming from that adoption of the accounting standards through increased employee stock option exercises. And that brought our tax rate down lower than what we were expecting for the second quarter. And that's the driver for why we lowered our tax rate guidance for the entire year. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. I'd call that a high-quality problem. And then for Inge. Maybe you can give us an update with a bit more specifics on Membrana. The slide called out you're exceeding financial expectations. Maybe a sense about how many businesses is Membrana expected to touch? You made a reference that Capital Safety is being rolled out to \u2013 there's 46 different product areas. I would imagine Membrana has probably higher potential to touch more 3M businesses. So maybe an update on Membrana, both from the financial standpoint and new products. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, first of all, the integration is going very well and we have, as you know, first of all, it's relative to the purification business where we tried it integrate that as fast as we can. And I think first things first, make sure we integrate it into 3M, make sure we can capitalize on what we can do together with purification business and then build it out as we go. I will not give you an exact number relative to how many businesses because I think it's more relative to platforms where you can use it. And I think about specifically going into Health Care and all that area where I think is big opportunity. So you think about that, you should be able to use it in Industrial applications, but you should also be able to use it in application that is specifically into Health Care. In terms of the growth rate, we grew that 5% in this quarter and we think it's like 8% plus for the year. And I think you will see the benefits in terms of all the synergy that we can drive. So I cannot give you exactly a number on divisions. But think about it as bigger platforms, both in Industrial and in Health Care specifically. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I got on a little late, Inge, so I apologize if you covered this. But I just wanted to touch on what's going on in auto. Can you give a little more color on your performance in the quarter? And can you scale for us the magnitude of the outgrowth that you're seeing in the business relative to production builds? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, first of all, automotive again did very well for us. And we had 7% growth versus auto car builds of 3%. So again, we outperformed. And when I look upon it on a geographical base, we were strong everywhere. We were strong everywhere around the world. I think maybe a little bit versus comparison earlier, maybe down a little bit in Mexico versus what we have seen before. But more than that, we saw good growth everywhere, including Germany. Generally speaking, we had a very good quarter in Germany, and that's very encouraging. We grew 5% in Germany in the quarter as a total enterprise, and automotive was part of that as well. So to answer your question, 7% up for automotive OEM versus car builds of 3%. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then if you look forward, Inge, based on production plans and content that you know you have in hand, would you expect that 4% type of differential to hold into the next year or two? Do you have visibility on that? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I expect that to hold as we move ahead. The advantage for us is that we can expand the application on the car. So we don't sell four tires. There's only four tires on a car and then maybe one spare tire. So if that's your model, you have a limitation. Our limitation is not there. So we can expand applications on the car. So I will say the penetration level that that group is driving for us is very impressive in the way I look upon it. And I expect good results from them as we move ahead. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Hey, Nick. So I want to go back to the ASU 2016-09. So you guys adopted this and it gave you a $0.10 benefit in the first quarter. And then you said you were going to repatriate cash to offset it. But then it looks like the lower tax rate's going to benefit you by $0.09 to $0.10. So I'm just trying to understand, what's the net of this? Is this basically the year? Is it that you're not repatriating any cash? Or you're repatriating less? Because obviously there's moving parts with respect to your stock price and other things. I'm just curious. Like what was the net benefit of these two impacts in the second quarter? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, John, I'll first talk about the total year and then I'll try to bring it into the quarter for you. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure. Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So for the year, at the time what I said three months ago is, yes, we're getting that benefit in the first quarter. But with our cash repatriation, it will end up being neutral for the year. We now for the year see a total benefit of approximately $0.10 net all-in, if we net the ASU, we net the cash repatriation. And the third piece that I'll remind you of is it also has impact on our share count. It increases our number of diluted shares outstanding, so the net impact we now see is approximately $0.10 for the total year. For the second quarter, the roughly 150 basis points lower that we saw in our tax rate from what I had originally guided, all of that is coming from the increased employee stock options that we saw in the second quarter. Nothing has changed on our plans that we communicated for cash repatriation and cash movements around the world. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So if it was $0.10 positive in the first quarter and it's going to be neutral for the year, and it sounds like with the lower tax rate, it was still a positive in the second quarter, is this a drag in the back half? Except that your tax rate's coming down, so I guess you would expect (1:03:36). Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so in the second half of the year we're anticipating that we'll have lower employee stock options and there hence lower tax benefit from that in the second half of the year. That's built into our current guidance for the tax rate. But we'll continuing to be seeing the headwinds from our cash repatriation and cash movement actions that we're taking. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then you guys lowered the annual guide \u2013 I mean, there's obviously \u2013 you roll all this up, there's a lot of below-the-line moving parts, various levels of tax rate movement and swings and options and so forth. Is the implication that because you lowered your annual EPS guidance by $0.05 that there wasn't an ability to find some below-the-line items to provide that offset? Because the $0.05 isn't really that much. So I'm trying to understand if there's an implication that you're sort of saying, we've already underspent on our restructuring, we've already sort of maxed out this stock option, what was going to be a headwind turned into a bit of a tailwind or whatever versus expectations. Is that kind of the signaling here? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : John, the signaling I'd take from that is we continue to see very good investment opportunities for the company. Opportunities that we've talked about for strategic investments, investments in accelerating growth in Health Care as I think Jeff just asked about that. So I see it as commitment that we see opportunities and we want to keep investing in those, not we're running out of options of what we can do to deliver current quarter or year's earnings. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then just lastly, what's the biggest driver of the delta for foreign currency? Is it the euro, or was there some other expectation baked in? I realize you say you don't have a lot of pound exposure. Was there some other fine-tuning of this? Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The yen is part of that movement. That's probably the most significant deviation. The euro, I'd put very similar to what we've been expecting throughout the year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe if I could squeeze one more in. You did really well in Canada. Companies like Granger and others have done poorly in Canada. Is there any other color you could add to that market? Because that economy's sort of \u2013 it's kind of very mixed, I think is the best way to put it. How did you guys do such a good job, so to your credit? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the team up there, yes, executed very well on the plan. And other thing that I think is important in that business for us up there, we have been there for long time. We have very good relation into the marketplace and our service level is very good. And one thing, Business Transformation starts and ends with the customer. Starts and end with the customer. Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than two years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer going into all your ERP system, result is coming. So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion. And I just think that team should be complimented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe. So, yeah, it's a very, very nice result. Is it surprise? No, it's not. It is not. It is based on very good relation with customers, total dedication through what we call Customer First and then the ERP system help the customer and us in order to lay out the demand plans and then for us is to deliver on it. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, and to your credit, you also cast a spotlight on companies that don't seem to know what they're doing there. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : In the vein of the business redesign, as you've been in a slow growth environment for a while, do you think returns on R&D and innovation are deteriorating or improving? That is, is innovation more differentiated in this kind of environment? Or are you seeing it get more challenging to get adequate returns? Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's an imperative for you in order to be successful. It's not either/or. It's based on 3M's model where research and development is the heartbeat of the company and where we add value on very attractive price point and value point for our customers. That is helping them improve productivity and/or adding value to their end products. So for me, it's an imperative in order for you to be able to run a business like we are doing with very good return to our shareholders. It's becoming more and more important in my mind, if you would like to be successful long term, that you have a very robust research and development organization with good platforms that they can use. So you need technology platforms. And you need the brains and you need, equally important of course, input from your customers when you build those platforms. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Okay. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. To wrap up, our team delivered another good performance in the second quarter as it relates to both financial results and building for long-term success. Going forward, we will remain focused on executing the 3M playbook, delivering efficient growth and continuing to create greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you soon again. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading, quarterly earnings. Before we begin, I would like to address our upcoming investor events, highlighted on slide number two. First, we have set the dates for our 2017 quarterly earnings calls. They are January 24, April 25, July 25, and October 24. Second, we'll be hosting our 2017 outlook meeting on the morning of Tuesday, December 13 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there. Finally, next June we will be hosting a European Investor Day at our Germany headquarters in Neuss. A welcome reception will be held the evening of June 6, followed by management presentations and a plant tour on June 7. Please hold the dates. Additional information will be provided closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide three. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide four and I'll hand off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow, and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio, and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100th straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years. With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while the combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by a similar amount. Looking closer at our organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from three business groups : Consumer, Safety & Graphics, and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety & Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. healthcare market. Industrial's organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. Finally, Electronics & Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call. Even in a challenging macro environment, the strength of our business model is enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow. Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%. Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also continue to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. Please move to slide five. You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes three levels that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. Two of the levers, investing in innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives. In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth through acquisitions which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships which combine our strengths with those of other organizations. Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established one partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records. To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month we announced a collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet Company. This is a partnership between two highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in healthcare coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of healthcare, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life. Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent actions to prepare 3M for the future. Three weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a non-core protective films business that will further enhance and focus our Industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation, with two recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in four of our largest European distribution centers. In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide six for a recap of our Q3 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter, with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana net of three small divestitures added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year. Looking at organic growth by geography, the United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety & Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics & Energy. In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety & Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy. Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1% and China/Hong Kong grew more than 4%. Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden, and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety & Graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5% and Brazil rose 2% while Canada declined 3%. Please turn to slide seven for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring, expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3. Looking at headwinds, first year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continued to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. And finally, organic volume declines along with related utilization impacts reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses. Let's now turn to slide eight for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedge gains, reduced pre-tax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent of $0.02 a share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments on international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS. Please turn to slide nine for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions. Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full-year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year to date. We now expect our full- year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion. Let's now review each of our business groups starting on slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter, with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our Automotive Aftermarket business. Advanced Materials declined double-digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. Looking by geography, Industrial's positive organic growth in Asia-Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S. Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016, and we expect to see further improvement in Q4. The Membrana acquisition, net of one small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3, and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%. Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were $1.4 billion, with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America/Canada which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5%, led by a double-digit increase in food safety along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care, and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. Latin America/ Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth while the U.S. was flat. Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remain strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business. Next, I'll cover Electronics & Energy on slide 13. Third quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth. Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-ing wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs. Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical markets declined high single digits, and Renewable Energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our Renewable Energy backsheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter. Our third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. Please turn to slide 14 where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single digit increase in our home improvement business. Within home improvement, our Command mounting projects, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters once again posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands. Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million, with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. Please turn to slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates. We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. Full-year organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat, at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus a prior range of down 1% to 2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full-year sales growth. The full-year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions. Operator : Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So my first question I guess is going to be on healthcare. It's been such a great business for you guys for such a long period of time. And the growth we saw this quarter was about the slowest growth we've seen, I think, since 2009. And so to your comments from earlier that you expect the soft market conditions to persist, I'm just curious. What specifically slowed down this quarter in that business? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well I think first of all, geographically, U.S. slowed down. And it slowed down basically in the last months of the quarter. And then I think there's two other elements out there in the world that happened to that business. Some, it's in developing economy where Brazil had a little bit of slowdown that was more than we expected. And then as you know, things are going on in Central East Europe, specifically in Turkey, that tempered it, generally speaking. So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States which we did, that would go over all businesses. The U.S. I think tried to move some purchases forward maybe one to two quarter. That's what we're talking about, like mid-term or short-term tempering. So I would say all businesses except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat, so still showed growth but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, the last couple of years. So there's no concern. Was just that it slowed down and it was basically in the last months of the quarter. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful color. And I guess the \u2013 just following on, on the kind of soft market conditions to persist comment. Does that mean we should be expecting 1% to 2% type growth in this business moving forward? Or how are you guys thinking about that? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, no. We don't \u2013 no, we don't change the guidance relative to that business moving forward at all. I think you should think about it, for the fourth quarter this year will maybe be very similar to the third quarter and then it will come back in the first quarter. I cannot tell you here and now \u2013 we cannot tell you here and now when in the first quarter that will come. It come early, mid or late in the quarter but it will come. So we don't change the guidance at all for this business moving forward into 2017. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe my follow-on question is on the buyback. I saw that you guys reduced the buyback guidance for the year. I think when we last spoke, we talked about if perhaps M&A was not going to come through that maybe we'd see a little bit more aggressive share repurchases in the second half of the year. And so I'm just curious, maybe talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline and just the reasons for the reduced buyback items. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well relative to the pipeline, it's still very good in terms of what we are looking upon in all businesses. And as I've said earlier, there's some prime target in terms of business groups there when \u2013 and if you think about it, with Industrial, one-third of the company, of course we have interest in that business. Health Care and Safety & Graphics continue also to be prime objectives for us, but the pipeline is very solid for all of the five business groups. So solid. As always we have a look upon it from a strategic perspective and then make sure that the valuation is acceptable for us. And Nick will make some comments here relative to buyback. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Joe. Yeah. As you've seen year to date, we've repurchased $2.8 billion of our stock. And in Q3, the market was trading at near all-time highs and you've heard me say this before, that one of the factors that influences our repurchase activity is relative value and price. And as you know, that's why we stepped up our activity earlier in the year in the first quarter. So over time, the pace of our repurchases is dependent on other demands on capital such as M&A along with the relative value of the stock. And those things are what's impacting us, now putting a guidance at $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Nick, you've said publicly that you're cautiously optimistic that you can grow margin in 2017, but obviously your overall markets have been a bit weaker than you expected. As we get closer to 2017, do you still have confidence that you can grow margin? And how should we think about the contributions of the drivers of the margin expansion? Business transformation should be a more meaningful driver than this year. Price costs still help. Maybe mix helps, but obviously we know pension and FX is offset. So maybe any more color that you can give us as we're getting closer to 2017 here. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Sure, Andy. As you can imagine, we're still working on our 2017 outlook. And on December 13, we'll provide more details on that at our outlook meeting. At a high level, Andy, we expect an external growth market to continue moving sideways in 2017. That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016. And then to part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017, probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have a increased positive impact on our earnings per share and net margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path. That said, we are as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about a $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in a month and a half. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, Nick. That's very helpful. Inge, maybe I can ask you about Industrial. You said the U.S. looked a little better, but overall it seems like Industrial, it didn't get as good as the comps got easier. Abrasives turned down again it looks like sequentially. You do have easier comps as you mentioned in 4Q and you expect growth. In advanced materials, I mean it should shift, especially as you've got this defense contract from last quarter. So should we resume low single-digit growth moving forward? And how confident are you of that in that business? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, as you said, so it being U.S. that hold back Industrial during the last couple of quarters, it was better in Q3. So that's positive, and we will see positive growth for Industrial in Q4. And that will be driven exactly as you said relative to we start to deliver now on the body armor. And we see some uptick in some of the other businesses. But it's very much the comp that will be a driver for us in Q4 and as we go into Q1. I'm very confident in our Industrial business group relative to growth going forward. And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that be relevant for us in order to serve our customers. We have seen during the last couple of years some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronics & Energy but in Safety & Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion, meaning also driving better margin for us. So in fact, we have fired some of our portfolios over the years. So and it takes some time as you go through that process. It's not like you start to shift your portfolio and you start to shift your infrastructure in the company and everything will come immediately. But I'm very positive that we, now we start to see Industrial turning the corner as we move forward. And we will see the first quarter happen here in Q4. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line with Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Want to get a sense, when I look at Electronics & Energy, you're going to anniversary the renewable energy exit that's 300 basis points. So pound for pound that means you're down 4.5%, not 7.5%. I mean do you have a sense of after that you start to get double easy comps, I guess, if you will. Is this a business that can turn actually positive in 2017 or just less negative? And I know your comment earlier is they would get better, but can we count on it not hurting us any more I guess is my question. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. I think first of all, you have to look upon that business in terms of the overall portfolio. So for this quarter, just to make a couple of comments, we did better in electronic than we thought, and it was slightly tough with energy. In the energy piece was some big project that was delayed, specifically in telecom and in utilities. So I think that's again coming back to uncertainty in the market. It was not much of a shift, but it was a little bit of a shift. All in, we were down 8%, exactly as we told you at the last earnings call. So I feel good about that piece. Going forward, as we have shift the portfolio there as well, we will as we go start to see some positive evolution relative to growth rate because we are moving to segments that are growing faster and where we are more relevant. So if you look upon it, it will be around automotive electrification, data centers, sustainability, chemistry and green automation. That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon \u2013 it's very much design and assembly. So we have a range in the five-year plan as you know of zero to 4. We are in the first year of that plan which is then down. So it will be still the low end of that range, but as we roll in here for the future we should start to see some more positive movements forward for us in terms of growth rate. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very good. And then as a follow-up on M&A \u2013 and I know... Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: And the other thing though, Scott. You look upon the margins now in that business. That business is now running at almost \u2013 they're 24%. So if you think about that where we started. We started at 15% 16%. That's work not only of cost out and structure out; it's also the portfolio work that had been going on. So for me when I look upon that business \u2013 and I think for all businesses, we should be positioned to win in places where we are relevant and can capitalize on technologies that we drive productivity and efficiency for our customers and also margins for us. So I think 8% down, you would like to grow. But we're able now to as I've said earlier, even where we are tempered on top line, we are able to deliver based on our new model. And we couldn't have done that for you five, six years ago. If we were down 8%, it would be terrible on the margins, so I feel confident now with our model there. And now as we move forward, now we will start to see some positive growth. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I remember those days well. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick follow-up, guys. When you're looking at transactions \u2013 and I think in the past you've said you'd like to start to look at some things that are a little bit bigger. I mean what are the probabilities we see in a deals larger than Capital Safety over the next 12 months? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: That's a very good question. It's a very good question. I don't know. I cannot get a probability of that. But as I've said the portfolio is rich in terms of candidates. I'd rather do slightly bigger than smaller. As I said earlier, we have during the last couple of years stepped up our probability \u2013 or the output on what we have done. And by definition, in order for us to move the needle forward, they should more sizable than we did in the past. So I think I hold it for then. Then when the news are coming out, we'll look upon the size of them. But we are ready. I mean we are ready. We are ready. I think we're on a good position to do what we need to do in order to bolster growth with or without acquisition. Also organically, we're doing okay. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good. Thank you for the answer. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Just wondered first of all if you could give a little bit more color on the slowdown you saw in the EMEA region in recent months relative to Q2. I know you talked a little bit about Turkey had slowed. But did you see anything broader, anything in Western Europe, for example? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, yeah. So if you start first of all, of Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. So yeah, of course, we saw, due to the situation, we saw Turkey slow specifically. And I think there was some slowdown also in Saudi Arabia. But I think if you look upon that region in total, yes, it's a tough situation. It's a tough situation there, and I think we have just to wait out for the euro-political situation to be settled before you start to see some big growth coming back there. Impact on West Europe. We had a very good quarter last quarter in West Europe and pleased with the quarter this quarter as well. Slightly slower growth, but still Germany had 3% growth in the quarter coming on a quarter last quarter that was 6%. So you add them together because the \u2013 a quarter or year doesn't start and end with a date. So if you look upon that. You take the biggest economy in West Europe, Germany, 6% for 3%. Let's say they are growing now around 4% and the business transformation is helping them. So I think the biggest concern generally speaking will then be Central East Europe and Middle East Africa in terms of growth rate at this point in time. I visited \u2013 Nick as well Europe just a couple of weeks ago and there's good momentum in the market, very much driven by automotive, by the way. So if automotive is doing well, we are doing well as well. So \u2013 but you saw this time, good growth in Sweden; good growth in Spain; Germany 3%. It's better growth than United States. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up question would be around electronics and within that on the OLED transition, specifically. I just wondered how you thought about your cost base on brightness enhancing film in light of that transition. And also I guess you've already started to see some impact from the OLED transition this year. Do you think that impact is significantly larger next year or pretty much steady in terms of transition rates? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think when you think about the cost, think about 3M as a company that are using multiple technology platforms. We have 46 technology platforms that is owned by the company, not one specific division or country. And then number two that we have manufacturing assets that can be used in multiple businesses. So \u2013 and as you can see now, the margin in that business, EEBG, as a business group, is on a very respectable level. So I would not be concerned on the cost side of the assets. On the technology transition, as I've said before, always when there is a technology transition, you can short term lose a little bit and then come back. I think it's important to know both in LED and OLED, we are providing solutions to those devices also that have OLED. It's slightly less but \u2013 than versus LED but we are still in that business and it's expanding in a way. I will say going into next year, I will look upon it may be similar to 2016 as we roll into the year. But we have worked on that for a long time. This is not a surprise for us. So that means that technologies is in the pipeline. And as I said, technology transition is always giving you either short-term up-tick immediately or you have to have a little bit of drag. But it will not be very, very long. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, good morning. This is Peter on for Steve. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Peter. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I was hoping maybe we could talk through some of the core pricing dynamics a little bit. So sort of parsing out between how much pricing was to offset FX headwinds and how much was core sort of pricing increases. Because it looks like price in the U.S. was negative but in many regions with positive price, that those are the regions that had negative FX. If you could talk to that a little bit. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Of course, Peter. Yes. For the third quarter in total, we reported 60 basis points of price growth. And 30 basis points of that was related to pricing adjustments we make in relation to FX. So you can split that right down the middle. 30 of it is core underlying price growth and another 30 related to FX. And many of you have probably heard me say over time that stripping out FX that our core ability to price ranges between 30 and 50 basis points. So we saw third quarter as another consistent quarter in that trend. In regards to the U.S., we were down slightly in price. That's really consistent with where we've been for the total year in the U.S. with prices more or less flat. And there's selected businesses at any given time where we're choosing to raise price, some where we're choosing to lower price based on competition. And in the case of the U.S., there's been selected cases where we've adjusted our pricing in our strategies to gain market share. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And maybe actually just sticking on the price or price raws. Earlier, I think it was Q3 you said you were expecting 100 basis points of benefit for this year. I know you've addressed next year. Is that still the range you're looking at? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes. We're still expecting price raws to be adding approximately 100 basis points to our margin for total 2016. Very similar to what we saw in Q3 which was also 100 basis margin benefit. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's great. And then just maybe last one on that, on the same point. How much \u2013 what was the split between price and raws in the quarter? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Of the 100 basis points of price raw materials, 70 basis points is coming from lower raw material prices. And that's really a combination of both. Some benefits we're seeing in commodity prices but increasingly reliance on our own sourcing teams' negotiations and productivity efforts. So that's 70 basis points. And the other 30 basis points from the price I talked about earlier. Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Shannon. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. On the Electronics & Energy margins being up at 24%, even on the down volumes, how should we think about that segment now? I mean you've got all the other segments sort of 22% or better. Comps are easing there. I mean should we now expect that, that kind of joins the rest of the group here at 22% or above on an annual basis? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: 22% for the EEBG? Is that what you ask or what? Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah. Electronics & Energy, I mean seasonally it's a little stronger here at 24%. But you've gotten every other segment up 22% and now you've changed the business model there. The volumes are easing. I mean is that kind of a reasonable entitlement view of where that segment should go? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Shannon, we expect E&E's margin for the total year of 2016 to be about 20% operating income margin. And it remains one of the businesses that we continue to see overweight margin expansion capacity in the coming years. So we're certainly striving to get it up to the company average, and I think you'll see it overweight for margin expansion in the next couple years. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just on this sort of temporary healthcare slowdown that you're seeing, just a little more color on what's driving that. I understand you think it's temporary and it's going to \u2013 you're confident in the future. But is it more channel inventories? Are there specific uncertainties that are driving a pullback? I mean it seemed like it was kind of broad-based. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : In the U.S... Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think the reality of business is that it will be both. But it start by people holding back a little bit and then they work down the inventory. But it's not an inventory correction in any sort or shape or form. I think it is yes, that people have a little bit of uncertainty here in the quarter of how this will shake out and then they're ready to go again. So I think it's a normal reaction for anyone around the world when you're going into a period of uncertainty relative to, will there be any changes or policies as you move forward, et cetera. So I'm not too, honestly, I'm not concerned at all \u2013 as I said, and you like to see more growth there of course with the margins we have. But it's not overall concern at all. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey \u2013 morning \u2013 Inge, I realize you have various industrial initiatives you're working on and you do have easier compares in the fourth quarter and obviously into next year. What about the markets, the broader U.S. industrial markets in which you serve? What do you see happening today in terms of the sequential trend? Is it getting better? Is it flat? Does the end of the quarter get a little softer as some companies experience? What did you see? Again, not your initiatives. I realize you've got initiatives that you're outperforming. But what are your markets industrially doing? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well as you saw, the U.S. IPI was negative 80 basis point in the quarter for Q4. So you think about that in terms of there's some negative thing there. But we see indications of positive movement in the industrial space relative to manufacturing. So we are not immune to the overall industry. And when you \u2013 at least what is projected now for the IPI in this was actually in Q3 was down 80 basis point in IPI output. For us, as we move ahead, we will see positive growth in Q4. And if you look into the year as we move ahead, Industrial is going for us over many, many segments if you like. Even into Safety & Graphics, in some pieces also in energy. And we see slightly, slightly positive movements in that total market segment as you move into next year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I'm sorry, Inge. What indications are you looking at where you say there's positive movement relative to manufacturing? You were talking about the macro. Is that sort of a customer commentary or is it about inventory? Or what exactly are these indications? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think it's both. It's like when you work with the customers, you get the indication of they start to see an uptick in order. I cannot comment on inventory. I don't think we have seen any change in inventory, to be honest. And I think it's a okay level at this point in time. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Switching to Electronics & Energy, could you size for us how big your businesses are that would have some sort of a \u2013 would touch in some manner LED or OLED? Like I mean just how big are these businesses? It's like $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, our electronics business is $3 billion out of the Electronics & Energy business. The display material solutions division within electronics is about 60% of that total, $3 billion, so about $1.8 billion. So, and much of that is connected with LCD but not all of it. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Nick, and what do you believe is the mix today of LED in these applications versus O-L-E-D or OLED? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Well it depends, John, on device. Right now, mobile phones is the most significant device impacted between LCD and OLED. And we see that as approximately 30% OLED today in 2016 and about 70% still LCD. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the rest are lower in the mix? Is that? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Right. For instance, television, still vast, vast majority LCD or LED. And tablets is a pretty small number there as well. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then just lastly, is the collapse of the British pound actually helping you in terms of your position in Britain and Europe or is it a headwind? Because relative to, I realize that FX, like the hedging gains issue, I'm sort of excluding that just in the context of the pound's collapsed, euro's down. It's not down that much. So all else equal, is this a net positive or a negative for 3M? And maybe you could put it in a context for us. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, it's about as close to a net neutral as you can imagine outside of FX. But from a standpoint we make some things in UK that we export, we also import things to UK. So it's very close to net neutral. Just having the pound devalue, that of course has a negative impact, but I think you're asking more the underlying and we're not a gainer or a loser in that. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So you're fairly agnostic to the pound, like if the pound goes to parity, you're going to be really agnostic to that scenario. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: So from a pound perspective, if for a 5% move in the pound, that would be about a $0.015 negative impact on us, just taking the FX impact of our UK. It's about 3% of our total global business. So just to size it up, how the pound movement impacts our total earnings per share. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, we ask that you please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First of all, Nick, helpful color on the 2017 puts and takes. I'm going to ask you to maybe comment on top line a little bit, because quite a few of your peer group companies are sort of starting to opine on 2017. And I'm wondering, you mentioned the macro sort of sideways which I think is probably in line with expectations. What sort of growth rates do you think 3M can generate in another flat year? And I'm asking in the context of a 3% organic consensus expectation for next year. Is 3% even in play here? Or any comments there would be helpful. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Nigel, I'll have to ask you to wait until December 13 for more specific numbers on that. But directionally, my comments about the external economy continuing to go sideways, I think that's a fair representation about how we're planning right now. And then incrementally that we see better improved growth in both Industrial and Electronics & Energy. But the actual numbers, let's wait until December 13 to talk about those. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. No, it's worth a try I guess. And then on pricing, I was quite surprised to see Latin America/Canada still above 5% given that the currency movements are starting to level off year-over-year. So I'm wondering, is that more of an inflationary type of impact that we're seeing with our pricing? And therefore, would that be stickier going forward? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Nigel, when I look at Latin America and our price growth there, yes. As we saw the real strengthen quite a bit in recent months, but we're still seeing high inflation in the economy in Brazil which is giving us the opportunity to be having price growth that's matching what's going on in the economy. So yes, it's much more around inflation than it is around FX right now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So plus 5% you think is sustainable going forward? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Sustainable going forward, I probably wouldn't go that far to call that sustainable. A lot depends on what the inflation rate continues to be, and I think that will be influenced by what happens with FX rates in the coming quarters. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I guess the first question I would have is, given the prospect for sideways growth, which isn't particularly surprising given the macro backdrop we've seen over the past couple of years, does that allow you to do anything differently in terms of your execution of global excellence or SKU rationalization in terms of picking up the pace anywhere? Or do you think it's just kind of steady-state? I mean, does the environment that's presented to you create more opportunities in general on structural restructuring, business transformation or cost take-out to accelerate some actions that you otherwise wouldn't take given the demand environment? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, I think first of all, it's \u2013 I don't think we're in a situation that we were in 2008 or 2009 where really everyone was pushed to do extraordinary things in order to improve the operations because there was no choice. I think we are in a situation now where we can work a model of do it when we can versus when we must, and I think that's an important differentiation to think about it. And everything we are doing now with the type of centralization, if you like, even if it's on a regional base, will help us a lot. And we are, yes, marching forward on that, marching forward in order to make sure that we build an organization for the future for 3M that both can grow and is becoming even more effective relative to operational excellence in the company. So we will go as fast as we can, but we are not taking any risks relative to be able to serve our customers. I think that's the important element. We are here to deliver to you what you expect, but we're also here of course to deliver to our customers. So I think you have this balance always when you implement new initiatives that you would like to go fast, but you have to make sure that you really understand the implication with the customers. So I think that's the answer to your question, that I and the team here, we are pushing as hard as we can to come as fast as possible to the most effective model, but you have always to think about customer first when you make those changes. But by definition, when you think about what we do in West Europe now, in terms of our inventories and so forth, yeah, of course it will be less SKUs because you consolidate inventories at fewer places et cetera. And that will roll out, and I'm sure that you have heard, and I know you have relative to our footprint initiatives that is, both in terms of manufacturing sites and in terms of distribution centers. So the answer is we are going as fast as we can, but we are not jeopardizing our service level to the customers. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that, and just one brief follow-up. I guess in terms of the growth for sideways for 2017, it is what it is and we're going to get more color on that on the December 13 Analyst Day. However, are there \u2013 going in terms of the setup for your portfolio right now and kind of dovetailing the comments you made in your prepared remarks, are there certain segments that you think you can significantly outgrow the end markets that present themselves through product introductions? Is there a set of cards that you like with respect to your portfolio, specifically to 2017 or 2018 where you think you have capability for significant outgrowth? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, you know, if you think about our business model, we have a proven model that we are able to outgrow IPI and/or GDP by 1.5x IPI or GDP. That is of course not happening every year, so but if you look upon it for 10 years, we have been able to do that. With all initiatives that we have taken in the company relative to the portfolio, relative to improved commercialization processes, et cetera, we should be able to do slightly better than that as we move ahead. I don't make a distinction in between certain segments that some will outperform more than others. We should be able to outperform at least 1.5x, maybe 1.7x as we move ahead in every segment we compete in because that is the expectation. That's why we are there. If we don't do that, we are not relevant in that segment to our customers, and then we have to do something different. So the other comment I would like to make is we cannot predict when a turnaround is coming in the economy. We cannot predict that. I don't think anyone can. One thing I would like you to know, we are ready. We are ready with everything we have done the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio, terms of the structure, in terms of stepping up the investment in research and development from 5.5% closer to 6% and the supply chain model, enabled by business transformation that all start and end with the customers. We are ready. So when it comes, we are ready in the forefront to capitalize on that. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey just a quick question from me \u2013 and Nick regarding the lower tax rate this quarter you mentioned a favorable audit. But did you also repatriate as much cash as you had talked about last quarter? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Deane, we've \u2013 as you know, we typically set a repatriation plan at the beginning of the year. We sometimes modify that if anything \u2013 well, it's gone up slightly of what we're repatriating from what our plans were at the beginning of the year. So it's eked up a little but not significantly, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just to clarify, and I might have missed this, on the strategic investments in the quarter, the manufacturing restructuring. What segments were those addressing and do you plan to do more there? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. The strategic investments that we had in the third quarter, some of them touch multiple businesses including Health Care and Industrial in the third quarter. And in total, we're still expecting that we're going to accelerate that pace throughout the year in 2016. It's been ramping up each quarter. I'm highly confident the fourth quarter will be the highest quarter for strategic investments for 3M for 2016 and pretty close to being in line to what I originally guided last December. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Just a quick one. Can you peel back a little bit what you're seeing in China in terms of end markets or your business lines which are getting better versus worse and how you're thinking about competitive pressure in the wake of ongoing SOE reform? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Laurence. Yeah. Well first of all, if you take our operation in China, we, ex-Electronic, we have 4% organic local currency growth in the quarter. If you take in Electronics into it which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the five business groups for us in China, SGBG grew 18%, Consumer 12%, Health Care 8%, and Industrial 2%. And then Electronic & Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had four or five business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer healthcare, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM, and personal safety. So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about, so it's not really a shift to try to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming but on the other hand it's a little bit slower we think versus the original plan. But if you think about that whole business; if you take the electronic part which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12% but it's 4%, and it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China. Now, that theme is driving productivity big-time. The model there today versus five years ago is different. Everything was about growth. We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%, so now productivity is a key element for us and I think that's important. We have good margins and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And just competitive pressure in any areas where you're seeing any real shift that matters? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, I think you have over year seen more domestic businesses or companies type of stepping up and I would say in all honesty, some segments which is maybe more commoditized, it could be a challenge. And for us, as you know, we work very much with technology conversion and with brand equity, so it's less impact for us. But of course there is this competition and I would say I would more relate that maybe to local companies that try to build coming into the market. Mostly, I would say in commodity-related businesses, meaning it's a price game, it's not a performance game and you have to ask yourself at the end of the day if you are 3M would you like to play in that area? Because as I said, in EEBG I'd rather fire some SKUs if I don't make money and have lower growth but better margin. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi. Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. So I didn't quite get the answer on electronics for next year, you said it's going to be better but does that mean growth? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, I'm going to leave it just as we expect it to be better. We'll talk more in December 13 of what we see for the total growth range for Electronics & Energy in 2017. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's fair. What's going on in Health Care? 1.5% comp was a little bit lighter than I expected. Anything particular than tough comp to last year? Is it the Health Information Systems business that's maybe seeing a bit of hiccup after the strategic evaluation? What \u2013 would you point to anything in Health Care we should be watching over the next couple quarters? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No. As I said earlier on the call, it's basically United States the type of temper itself for the quarter, so I wouldn't be overly concerned about that. As I said earlier, you had some developing market, like Brazil, I think we saw a slowdown as well, but more than that, it's I wouldn't be overly concerned about it and I am not. And I think that's maybe the best piece for me to be in it, that I'm not overly concerned. But as I said, maybe in Q4 we will see equal quarter to Q3 until some uncertainty is in place. But as you see, we continue to invest. I told you about we did one acquisition in Switzerland for Health Information System, and then we also signed a partnership with Verily, both Verily and 3M, two very creative dynamic companies that are building out platforms. So we look very, very positively to not only Health Information System but all businesses in that business group. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : One last quick one just on Q4. Nick, I think the implied price cost margin tailwind is about 40 basis points if I back into the 100 basis points you're guiding to for the year given you've been above that so far for the year. Is that about the right number for the fourth quarter? Is that just conservatism or is that kind of a new solid run rate to expect going forward, just trying to split the goalpost there a little bit? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, we have been seeing the benefits from raw materials slipping as we move from quarter to quarter. The 40 basis points where you're doing the math of coming out with 100 basis points, I'd call that more just a function of rounding where the actual math might come out a little higher than that and we're just rounding it to approximately 100 basis points. I wouldn't over read that Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That makes sense. That's sort of our job to over read everything, sorry. Thanks. Talk to you soon. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing the 3M playbook and preparing our company for the future. As you know, we have done a lot of work over the last several years to adjust our portfolio, improve our cost structure, enhance our technology capabilities and make us even more relevant to customers. So while the macro environment is challenging at the moment, we are positioned well for when global growth conditions improve. This is true both for developed and developing markets where we have the experience, the market position and depth of capabilities to capitalize on the win as their economies recover. With that, I think you for joining us this morning, and we're looking forward to see you in New York on December 13. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 24, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading, quarterly earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our investor events in 2017, as highlighted on Slide 2. First, starting with earnings, this year\u2019s conference calls will be held on April 25, July 25, and October 24. Second, we will be hosting a European Investor meeting on June 6 and 7 at our Headquarters in Neuss, Germany. Please hold the dates, additional information will be provided closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll handoff to Inge. Inge? Inge Thulin : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin my remarks with a recap of the fourth quarter and later in the call, I will provide some comments on our full-year performance. Our team had a good finish to 2016 as we delivered double-digits growth in earnings per share along with strong margins and a robust cash flow. We also continued to position 3M for the future through our three key levers while returning significant cash to our shareholders. With respect to EPS, we posted earnings of $1.88 per share, an increase of more than 13% year-over-year. Total sales across our enterprise was $7.3 billion, up slightly versus last year's Q4. Organic growth companywide was 2% with three of our five business groups delivering positive organic growth. As I indicated in our October earnings call, organic growth in Industrial turned positive in the fourth quarter. This business had a strong finish to the year with 5% organic growth, which was broad-based across the portfolio. Safety and Graphics posted 2% organic growth with a good performance from personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses, as well as from roofing granules. As we expected, organic growth in Health Care was similar to the third quarter at 1.3%. We expect Health Care to regain its momentum as we move further into 2017 and as our additional growth investments begin to pay off. Organic growth in Consumer was down 1%, while this business experienced positive point of sales across its retail customers, it was negatively impacted by inventory reductions throughout the retail industry. Electronics and Energy closed out the year with another quarter of sequential improvement posting organic growth that was down just slightly, while once again expanding its operating margins. Looking at margins across our entire Company, we delivered another strong broad-based performance. Margins were up more than 200 basis points to nearly 23% ranging from 30% in Health Care to 21% in Safety and Graphics. At the same time, we generated healthy cash flow with the free cash flow conversion rate of 154%. Our strong and consistent cash flow enables us to invest in the business, while also return significant cash to our shareholders. And in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we had a good finish to 2016 and I would now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with Slide 5, where I will breakdown the fourth quarter change in sales. Organic local currency sales grew 1.6% in the quarter with organic volume up 1.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points. This impact relates to the divestitures of non-strategic businesses further evidence of our ongoing portfolio prioritization and focus on our best opportunities. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percentage points. Considering all factors, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 0.4% versus last year. On a geographic basis, U.S. organic growth increased 1.2% led by a mid single-digit performance in Industrial. Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses also grew organically in Q4. Turning to Asia-Pacific, organic growth was up 2.4% with Health Care and Consumer leading the way. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics and Energy during the quarter. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 6% in China/Hong Kong and 3% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China/Hong Kong was up 11%, and Japan grew 2% organically. EMEA organic growth declined 2.4%. West Europe was down 1% as growth in Safety and Graphics and Industrial was more than offset by declines in our other business groups. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa declined mid-single digits year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which we expect to persist in the near-term. Finally, Latin America/Canada was our fastest growing area with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. We saw solid growth in four of our five businesses led by high single-digit growth in Health Care. At a country level, Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth, while Canada was up 3%, and Brazil increased 1%. Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion and we generated earnings of $1.88 per share, a Q4 record. GAAP operating margins were 22.7%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, which we delivered while making incremental strategic investments of $50 million to drive future sales and profit growth. On the right hand side of this slide, you\u2019ll see the components of our margin performance. Starting with the benefits, price in raw materials combined increased margins 50 basis points versus Q4 of 2015. Market prices for many raw materials were once again favorable year-on-year and our global sourcing team continues to deliver savings above market. Core price growth was down slightly in the quarter as we took targeted actions to drive organic volume growth. Moving to restructuring, you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced a restructuring plan to enhance our competitiveness and productivity. The associated benefit from this action boosted fourth quarter 2016 operating margins by 40 basis points year-on-year in addition to the positive comp related to the Q4 2015 charge itself. Pension and OPEB expense declined year-on-year, as has been the case throughout 2016. This increased Q4 margins by 90 basis points. Organic volume and utilization was neutral to margins in the quarter, a marked improvement versus the headwinds we experienced through the first three quarters of 2016. Improved organic volume growth was a factor in this improvement, particularly in our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses. Turning now to headwinds, foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 20 basis points in Q4. Legal and other reduced margins by 30 basis points in the quarter primarily due to higher year-on-year costs from legal settlement. Incremental strategic investments lowered margins by 70 basis points in the quarter. As we indicated during our December outlook meeting, we are increasing investments in a number of core platforms to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond. At the same time, we continue to take actions in Q4 to better optimize our global manufacturing footprint, improve service to our customers and drive ongoing productivity. Finally, well, you don't see it on this chart. Q4 corporate and unallocated costs were higher than anticipated, largely due to the aforementioned legal costs. For the full-year 2017, we anticipate corporate and unallocated costs will be in the range of $225 million to $275 million. Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings increased 13.3% to $1.88 per share. As you see a number of factors impacted our earnings, growth and margin expansion added $0.16 to per share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.04 per share, driven by gains on the divestiture of the Polymask business within Industrial, along with the sale of non-core intellectual property in Electronics and Energy. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $18 million or the equivalent of $0.02 per share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year reducing per share earnings by $0.02. Our fourth quarter and full-year tax rate came in lower than we had projected due to a combination of increased benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, along with improved geographic profit mix. The Fourth quarter tax rate was 28.2% versus 29% in last year's fourth quarter, which increased earnings by$0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-over-year, which added $0.04 to fourth quarter EPS. Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $2.2 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 154% in Q4 and 104% for the full-year. For the third consecutive year, free cash flow conversion exceeded 100%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $436 million in CapEx, bringing our full-year investment to $1.4 billion. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full-year 2016, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.7 billion and gross share repurchases of $3.7 billion. For 2017, we expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Let's now review our Business Group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 9. Industrial posted Q4 sales of $2.5 billion leading the Company with organic growth of 4.6%. Our automotive OEM business led Industrial delivering strong double-digit growth continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Advanced Materials, Automotive Aftermarket and our Separation and Purification business all posted solid mid single-digit growth year-on-year. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was broad-based across all regions with mid single-digit growth in Latin America/Canada, the U.S. and Asia Pacific while EMEA was up low single-digits. The Industrial business delivered strong operating income of $553 million in the quarter with margins up 260 basis points to 21.9%. The margin improvement was driven by the gain on sale of Polymask, past restructuring actions and ongoing productivity improvements. Please turn to Slide 10. Safety and Graphics delivered another good quarter with fourth quarter sales up 2.2% organically to $1.3 billion. Our Personal Safety business posted solid mid single-digit organic growth in Q4. This included double-digit growth in China/Hong Kong, where we continue to experience strong end market demand for our personal safety solutions. The Roofing Granules business delivered another solid quarter of high single-digit growth which capped off a consistently strong year. On a geographic basis Safety and Graphics growth was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada, which were up mid single-digits. You may recall in December, we announced the sale of our Identity Management business. We continue to expect the divestiture will be completed sometime during the first half of 2017. Safety and Graphics operating income was $270 million in the quarter and operating margins decreased 100 basis points to 20.8%. Adjusting for the divestiture gains and restructuring charges that occurred in Q4 of 2015, operating margins increased 120 basis points year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 11. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was up 1.3% in line with our expectations. Health Care growth was led by a double-digit increase in food safety, followed by solid growth in both drug delivery systems and medical consumables. Organic growth in oral care was down slightly as the business continued to be impacted by soft and market conditions and channel inventory adjustments. Health information systems also declined organically year-on-year due to a slower rate of software installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with the challenging comp against last year's record Q4. Looking ahead, our customer pipeline is strong. Therefore, we expect growth in health information systems to accelerate throughout 2017. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered high single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific with particular strength in China/Hong Kong, which was up double-digits. Latin America/Canada and the U.S. also posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Health Care\u2019s operating income was $410 million and margins remained strong at 29.8%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $30 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales for Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 0.6% organically. Organic sales growth was flat in our electronics related businesses an improvement over recent quarters as end market conditions and channel inventories became more stable. As we explained at our outlook meeting in December, we are gaining penetration with leading electronics OEMs in China and also investing to capitalize on the rapid growth in automotive electronics. Our Energy related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in our telecom business more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we exited our backsheet business in renewable energy, which reduced energy related organic sales by 3.5% in Q4 of 2016. On a geographic basis, sales in Latin America/Canada grew organically in the low single-digits, while Asia-Pacific and EMEA declined. Electronics and Energy delivered a strong operational quarter with operating income of $326 million and margins of 26.9%, up 10.3 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year improvement was driven by a few factors that impacted Q4 margins in both 2015 and 2016. First in Q4 of 2015, we incurred charges related to portfolio and restructuring actions, which reduced fourth quarter 2015 margins by 340 basis points. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the business realized a gain from divesting non-core intellectual property, which added 270 basis points to Q4 2016 margins. Adjusting for these items, Q4 margins increased year-on-year by approximately 400 basis points. Looking at the full-year operating margins were 22.3%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. And as Inge mentioned, growth was impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent West Europe. So from a pure selling perspective, our fourth quarter organic growth was down 0.7%. On the other hand from a point of sale or sellout perspective, our Q4 growth was positive in the in line with our historical trends. So we expect consumers organic growth will be back to more normal historical levels during the first quarter. Despite these channel adjustments, we posted positive worldwide organic growth in three of our four businesses, namely Home Improvement, Consumer, Health Care and Home Care. The Stationery and Office Supply business, which was most impacted by channel adjustments declined year-on-year. Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a mid single-digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while the U.S. was flat, and EMEA declined year-on-year. Consumers operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 20.9%. Margins were down year-on-year for two primary reasons. One, we rationalized one of our manufacturing sites during the quarter, and two, the business accelerated growth investments in the quarter. We continue to see good opportunities to invest and drive growth within the portfolio. In fact, we increased investments in Q4 in our category-leading Command and Filtrete product lines. Both posted double-digit organic growth in the U.S. this past holiday season. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll hand it back over to Inge for some final comments before Q&A. Inge? Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter kept a successful year for our enterprise, as we executed a playbook and delivered a strong operational performance. We increased our earnings per share by 8%. Margins were up more than 100 basis points to 24% with four of our five business groups posting margin expansion. In addition, we delivered free cash flow conversion of 104%, which is our third consecutive year above 100%. And for the fourth straight year, our return on invested capital was above 20% coming in at 23% this year and we achieved all of this in a year of flat growth. As you can see, we are executing well and controlling what we can control. 2016 was also a notable year with respect to our dividend, as we marked 3M\u2019s 100 consecutive year or paying dividends to our shareholders. For the full-year, when we combine dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of $6.4 billion to our shareholders. During financial results, we continue to build for the future through our three key levers, which are significant value creators for us. Let me start with portfolio management and ongoing process that is all about strengthening and focusing our portfolio, which improves our competitiveness and make us more relevant to all customers. This includes consolidations within 3M, along with divestiture of non-core businesses, and we were active in both fronts in 2016. Portfolio management is benefiting our customers and 3M as we now have greater scale and are able to better prioritize our resources. This includes growth investments and at our December outlook meeting, we highlighted incremental $100 million we are investing to accelerate growth in our core platforms. We will now move on to the second lever, investing in innovation. In 2016, we invested $1.7 billion or nearly 6% of sales in Research and Development, which is the heartbeat of our Company. This supports both our short and long-term growth objectives and along with our premium margins a return on invested capital. Last year, we also celebrated opening of a new laboratory in St. Paul, while earning more than 3,000 patents around the world. Business transformation is the third lever, which starts and ends with our customers. Last year, we will continue to make good progress with the rollout of our ERP system in West Europe, which is nearly complete. Within West Europe, we have now deployed in 11 countries our four largest distribution centers and our supply chain center of expertise. Globally, we now have a total of 16 countries live and a new ERP system and our three global service centers are also up and running. We are already beginning to realize productivity gains from business transformation, which will increase in 2017 and beyond. By 2020, it will result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. Looking upon our performance in 2016, the 3M playbook is working. From an operational perspective, we are executing well and delivering premium returns. At the same time, we continue to make investment that would enable us to capitalize as growth conditions improve. As a result, we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another strong performance in 2017. Please turn to Slide 15. Here you see our planning estimates for the year, which are unchanged from December outlook meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.80 and increase of 4% to 8%. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3% and we anticipate another good cash flow performance with a conversion rate of 95% to 105%. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Scott. Nicholas Gangestad : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : When I look at my list of companies at least, you guys tend to be, obviously, about as global as anybody gets and have a pretty broad supply chain. And my question is how do you plan spending on even 2017? I mean how do you plan spending when you don't have a real great sense of tariffs and trade and how all that could be disrupted in the next couple of years? Does that play into the planning at all or do you just continue on? Inge Thulin : Hi, good morning by the way. Scott Davis : Good morning. Inge Thulin : As you know, we are laying out very much localization strategy in terms of our business well all subsidiaries around the world. So at this point in time, we continue to lay out the plan as we have talked about. We are making investment in what we see the most important businesses for us to grow both in the United States and overseas based on that strategy, right. So by definition, even if we have both the global customers and local customers, we need to make the investment based on what they are and what they are going. And I would say that when I look upon this quarter specifically, there is some very interesting movements, I think coming back a little bit to historic performance relative to growth, which we had that 1% growth in developed markets, but we are 3% in developing markets. So there is type of a movement going also coming back in the developing economies, which is interesting. And as you heard Nick said, if you take China, China was 6% organic local currency growth all in excluding electronics was 11 and when look upon our five businesses in China specifically it was fantastic growth all of them. We have Safety and Graphics grew almost 20%, Consumer 17%, Health Care 15% and Industrial 12%. So we need to continue to invest based on the growth in those segments. So we don't make a change at this point in time relative to the planning for the year and as we said in December, we are adding another $100 million this year in order to accelerate commercialization of products. But I would say generally speaking, it's early in the year as we know, but I saw some trends here that our positive relative to growth coming. You saw Industrial business group almost 5% growth and it was broad-based all over the world. They grew in every geographical area around the world. So very encouraging as I look upon it. For Germany, they have positive growth for the third consecutive quarter for us. So I feel more positive as we move into 2017 even if it's early. Scott Davis : Just a quick follow-up when you guys think about - I\u2019ve never asked this question before, I don't know why I haven't, but is there such a thing is book-to-bill in Electronics and Energy or is it too short cycle for that? Inge Thulin : Once again, can you repeat the question? Scott Davis : Sure, is there such a thing is like a book-to-bill or something like that Electronics and Energy where you can get a sense of which quarter of this year coming up, you turn into positive territory? I don\u2019t know again why I\u2019ve never asked that question before, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever referenced it. Just trying to get a sense of which quarter you might see positive growth and that would\u2026? Nicholas Gangestad : Scott, let me take that one. We don't have a formal metric that we're measuring on a book-to-bill ratio in our Electronics business. It is a fairly short cycle, we're working with all of our customers there to be projecting, what the demands are in the future, but unlike some other industries, this is not one where we have a book-to-bill ratio. Scott Davis : Okay. That's what I thought, but I have to ask. Thank you guys, and good luck to you. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just a question firstly on the Consumer business, I don't recall you talking about the slowdown much at the mid-December meeting. So I wondered if it was something, the inventory reduction was something that became apparent sort of very late on? Is there any color you could give around days or weeks of excess inventory in those channels today? Inge Thulin : Julian as far as the consumer business in the trends we saw throughout the fourth quarter much of this differential we saw between sell in and sell out occurred in December and in particular in the last half of December. In regards to inventory, we don't really see the channel is having excess inventory now. We considered a fairly normal inventory channel level in our consumer channels. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then if we look at the margin bridge, it was curious a little bit that the utilization piece and organic volume was not a contributor. It was flat even though the sales growth performance was actually pretty good. Was there anything unusual in Q4 that weighed on that specific line in margins that meant the operating leverage was not as high as it could or should have been? Inge Thulin : Yes, Julian that's and I'll just put it in perspective, we've had that particular item being noticeably negative on our margin for the first three quarters of this year and getting that to be neutral for us for the fourth quarter with our 1.5% volume that's the main thing that happened for us in the fourth quarter. There isn't some particular headwind buried in there, but it was for us a notable trend change from where we've been the first three quarters. Julian Mitchell : And do you still feel good about $0.10 to $0.20 of EPS accretion in 2017 from utilization. Inge Thulin : Yes, we do Julian. That component of our EPS lock as well as every other line, we're still feeling very confident in right now Julian. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Andrew. Nicholas Gangestad : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So just a follow-up on Industrial, we know you have significant short-cycle exposure within Industrial and you did have easier comparisons in the quarter. But I think that growth jumped pretty meaningfully. Maybe you could give us some more color on how much of the improvement was maybe the energy component within advanced materials looking less bad or we know you had the big defense contract ramping up within advanced materials versus the rest of the Industrial business improving. And then how do you feel about your 1% to 3% growth forecast now for 2017, given you put up over 4% in 4Q? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all it was broad-based growth in Industrial, both in terms of the businesses and in terms of the geographical area. So that was not one specific business that type stood out of in terms of growth, even if you saw a Nick comment on - again the fantastic performance for the automotive OEM business, but it was broad-based and it's coming back, I would say a little bit as we have talked about earlier in terms of evolution of economies. And I think you've seen now as becoming more output from manufacturing around the world, we are very early in that process. And if you look upon PMI, the United States had a PMI of 54.7% in the quarter, China 51.4%, and Germany 55.6%. If you think about that in terms of big economies that will help us as we move forward, and as I said, it was broad-based. Now to your second question, how we feel about 1% to 3% for the year as we came out of 5%? Feel good, feel good. Too early to change that as we sit here today, but generally speaking, I would say, feel good about Industrial businesses. And if you think about in terms of size, this is one-third of 3M and when we start to get good momentum in that business, that's helping us, a lot, right. You saw they had good growth and we talked about that on the last earnings call that they will grow in Q4 and they did and it's very good. But yes, I said that\u2019s too early to change anything as we move into the year, right, so let's see after first quarter how we position it. Nicholas Gangestad : Hey, Andy just one more detail on that I'll share. We've been talking about this for a quarter or two that we have some defense contracts we were awarded and those shipments were going on in the fourth quarter. Our body armor shipments added about 150 basis points to the total Industrial organic growth in Q4, so stripping that out the core underline is right around 300 basis points of growth. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Nick, that's helpful. And then, Nick, you've talked about 3M's ability to achieve 30 to 50 basis points [of pressures] across in 2017. You obviously did 50 basis points in 4Q. But pricing in the U.S. continues to look competitive. It was a bit worse in 4Q than it was in 3Q. You mentioned sort of going after some additional organic growth. Can you talk about 3M's ability to offset a pretty competitive U.S. pricing environment? With the better sourcing and with the help of business transformation that you talked about are you still confident in positive price versus cost contributing to that $0.20 to $0.50 of organic global currency growth that you have? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Andy there is a lot of subjects you hit there in one question. As far as the underlying price growth in the U.S., what we see in our view is our fundamental pricing power is not changing. It's still very strong. We did in the case of the U.S. take some targeted actions to help drive organic volume growth for us. Also for the total Company and this isn't going outside the U.S. This is a quarter where we saw less pricing actions related to FX movements and you see that with our - and that's down noticeably from where we've been in the first three quarters of this year. So all in for 2017, we're still expecting the positive core price growth in the U.S. and globally. Now to the other parts of it, our ability to use sourcing to continue to add to our earnings into our margin. I laid out a month ago that we expect between $0.10 and $0.15 of EPS accretion through our sourcing effort and everything we're seeing now, we see that on track, much of that is being driven not by just pure market prices, but it's now being driven by our own efforts to be substituting raw materials and taking advantage of our negotiation power. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nicholas Gangestad : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Congrats on the 100 years of paying a consecutive dividend; not a lot of companies can claim that. The first question I have is on Health Care. You talked a little bit about regaining momentum, and I recognize that you had some product introductions in the quarter, but you also still have some headwinds on Oral Care. And I'm just curious, given the headwinds also potentially from the ACA, I'm just wondering like what gives you kind of the confidence that you could really see the momentum pick up as we progress through 2017? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all most of our businesses are doing very well, right. So food safety is still growing very well, drug delivery system did well as well and then consumables in medical space did well. So if you take that together, right, there is underlying momentum in the business. We have invested quite a bit in this business for some time and we stepped that up and they have had a big investment starting already second half of 2016 and that now we'll start to generate growth coming into Q2 and Q3 for the year. And the pipeline as Nick comment on, the pipeline for health information system is very strong, so yes, it\u2019ll slow down a little bit in terms of execution and deployment of that software into the hospitals, but the pipeline is very, very strong. So I would say that when you think about it generally speaking, we know that with investment in the areas we invest in Health Care, which around coverage, is around health economics and that's about some research and development, specifically the coverage will pay off rather sooner or than later. And again we see that the developing economies are starting to pick up for us. So the confidence is high that we will see the growth coming as we move into 2017. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And then maybe my follow-up question and getting back to price cost for a second. Nick, maybe talk a little bit about the fact - it looks like you got about 10 basis points or so on pricing this quarter. We're moving into more of a kind of a commodity reflating environment. So how is that dynamic going to work as we progress through 2017 on your ability to continue to get price? Nicholas Gangestad : Joe the total posted 10 basis points if we strip out the FX portion of that and then we're looking at flat to down very slightly of core underlying there. As I look at how this progresses throughout the year, we actually have a pretty steady view throughout the year Joe, if it changing much of just much of just having our core underlying price growth often in that 30 basis points to 50 basis points. I think the wild card on there is FX, the dollar been moving a lot and that as far as what we post for price growth in the quarters will be volatile in the coming quarters with some volatility based on what happens with the U.S. dollar primarily in developing markets. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got you. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Steve. Nicholas Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker : Just back to the pricing questions, specifically, you mentioned targeted actions that you took in the U.S. to drive some volume? Can you give us a little more color on what segments you were talking about, what areas? Inge Thulin : Yes, Steve, it\u2019s in particularly isolated places, there is some places in our consumer business, where we took actions like that also in our Industrial business. Those are the most common places where we took those types of targeted actions Steve. Steven Winoker : Okay. And with the trigger for that kind of thing, competitive actions was it particular projects I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of the implications for the broader pricing power in those businesses? Inge Thulin : Steve, we take those actions when we see an opportunity either in the competitive landscape to take share that we otherwise want to have or in some cases it's a reaction to where we see pricing pressure from competitors and we price accordingly to maintain some other shares, so it's some of those Steve. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just a more specific question on E&E. Can you just give a little more sense in display materials systems, how much was OLED impact to this quarter and what the other kind of impact besides OLED was? Inge Thulin : The OLED impact or just to put it in perspective, last December when Jim Bauman was laying out the OLED impact that we felt that would have on 2017 sales, we put a range between $50 million and $150 million of impact. We saw a number impact for total year 2016 right in the middle of that range and for the fourth quarter I would call it very similar to that of $20 million to $30 million range of impact on our total revenue. Steve that's the OLED impact on what we're seeing in the Electronics and Energy business. Steven Winoker : Okay. And any major offsets to that? Inge Thulin : Yes. As I mentioned, we are targeting to be increasing our penetration in some of the OEMs in China, electronics OEMs in China and we're seeing some success there. We're also targeting growth in automotive electronics and we're also seeing some successes there as well. Steven Winoker : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thanks everyone. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Hey, John. John Inch : Hey Nick, hi Inge. How did the Dental business do sequentially? I don't remember you talking about that when you were describing the puts and takes in the Health Care performance. And it was under pressure, right in the third quarter? Did you see a similar trend in the fourth quarter? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. John, we saw our Oral Care down slightly, partly from softening end user demand and also what we see is continue channel contractions in the Oral Care business. John Inch : Do you have any sense of the underlying - it's one thing if it's one quarter, because sometimes dental, it seems is a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, right, for the economy. But now the economy, based on your own commentary and what other companies are saying, seem to be picking up. So what do you attribute then, I suppose the continuation of the soft dental? Is there a way you could frame what you've seen and maybe provide some historical context? Inge Thulin : Yes. I think what you saw in the last quarter of the year, basically the two things is inventory reduction in the channel, because it's very much distribution-oriented and that's based on lower demand in the end market. And I think that was based-based relative to United States and West Europe. Now, if you think about both in consumer and you think about the business like Oral Care, the supply chain there is very sophisticated. So what we have to look upon is sell-in and sell-out, and I think in those cases, what you will see as demand will by definition should go up and I think the facts are telling us that in that industry in Oral Care then they would build up inventory, again, as you go into the year. But for us, we look upon those businesses, they are very good partners of ours and they are very professional very, very professional in the supply chain, so they do the right thing in terms of adjusting their level of inventory if they see a softness. What they are telling us now is they see demand coming back as you roll into 2017. If you move from Oral Care and go back and I was not sure that came across. If you take our consumer business that was down 1% in terms of sell-in from us, sell-out on our top customers in U.S. was 3%. So in 3% that's the historical base for consumer for the last couple of years. So from that perspective, I think the retail channel stay, so maybe some softness for them, generally speaking in the end of the holiday season they did the right, they just managed through their inventory and for me that's a very professional way of doing business. Our sell-out was the same indicating for me as we move into 2017 that inventories will be filled back because the demand will steady in the end market, but I think they did the right thing in terms of the retail channels. John Inch : Well, I certainly give away your products as Christmas gifts, so don\u2019t let me\u2026 Inge Thulin : We can do more. John Inch : Yes, bigger gift bags. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned divesting non-core IP in the Electronics and Energy business. Nick or Inge, could you expand on this? What exactly is this and do you have like this reserve of IP that in theory, you could keep divesting to take gains? Or was this a one-off event or just a little more context on what ultimately happened in that segment please? Nicholas Gangestad : John, I think this is much more of a one-off. There was a particular set of IP that we had developed and we're using years ago, we reached a point where we felt we no longer needed it for our own business and we were licensing that IP, we chose in the fourth quarter to sell that IP and our relationship with that that particular IP we had in Electronics and Energy. To your question, is it a broad thing that we have a stable of these we\u2019re ready to go with? The short answer is no. John Inch : Okay. And then when you say it wasn't core, is there anything you'd say about the IP you sold? What was it for or is it pertaining to anything you downsized or something? Nicholas Gangestad : No, it's something related to our electronic materials solutions division and that's about as deep as I'll go with that, but it really is not related to anything we divested. John Inch : Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy : Good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning. Robert McCarthy : I guess the first question is in terms of just thinking about your overall explicit exposure to energy and kind of the wider implications and [knock down] effects of your portfolio to energy, given what we've seen in the downturn, have you seen any encouraging trends across your businesses that you would cite to say with the stabilization in energy prices, you could start to see incremental growth in the back half of this year? Could you just comment about what you're seeing across your portfolio with respect to that? Inge Thulin : Yes. I think first of all the answer is yes, we should see an uptick in the end of 2017 in the energy space and we have a very strong solid business in two utilities, right. That's a core 3M business and in fact this is a Heartland division. That division will do well. What they have is they have an element of some project-based businesses and we had talked earlier about ACCR and there is some pipe coating as well that had a type of a negative effect in terms of comparison for 2016 and should benefit that business as you move into 2017. The other business that we had a good quarter here is actually communication, what you will call telecommunication, but communication had a good quarter for us with 10% growth. It\u2019s a smaller business for us, but we did well. So I think the energy space for us should improve as we move into 2017. Robert McCarthy : How do we think about the offsets in association with just kind of price cost and raws in the context of that though? Nicholas Gangestad : Rob, as we contemplate where we see our raw material pricing going in 2017, we took a view of oil in the range of somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel and that's why we're seeing diminished impact from market prices on our commodities benefiting us in 2017 versus what we've seen in 2015 and 2016. So we\u2019re anticipating that in taking that into account. Most of our raw material or commodity benefits we\u2019re seeing are going to be the result of 3M efforts we're doing to take cost or substituting lower commodities. So there is an offset there and we think we\u2019ve pretty accurately taken the offset on both the revenue side and the cost side into account. Robert McCarthy : One final one, obviously, I don't think you provide or disclose where your CapEx is spent explicitly, although, obviously, anecdotally you do. But just looking at kind of the typical Note 17 in your 10-Ks, you can kind of see a flavor of where your PP&E is. It's disproportionate in the U.S. unsurprisingly, and obviously, the PP&E has been growing reasonably well in the U.S. while it's been relatively flat, I would say, across the balance of the portfolio. But could you comment on explicitly your CapEx kind of strategy for the U.S., any kind of metrics you could use? And really the spirit of the question is obviously with the prospect of a change in the tax law in association with the deduction of capital expenditures in the U.S. potentially, that's the nature of what I'm asking about. Nicholas Gangestad : Rob, as you look at our total CapEx, we spent $1.4 billion on CapEx in 2016, a little more than half of that was spent in the United States, and it goes into a number of things, Rob. It goes into some of our business transformation investments; it goes into maintaining our capital base. Of all the areas of the world, the U.S. we have a very well developed capital base of manufacturing sites and investing in CapEx to maintain that, also some expansion in the United States that we've been investing in, so a little over half of it. It's around the world though Rob, we are investing in capital as Inge as started out this morning and talking about we're investing in capital to align with where our customers are and aligning demand. So where we've been in the last few years, we've seen a little less international demand and a little higher U.S. demand and that has impacted our capital allocation. And going forward, we still anticipate a significant amount of our capital, for the next year or two; I won\u2019t be surprised that it's going to maintain being over 50% in the U.S. Robert McCarthy : Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. Just of the investment spending picked up this quarter relative to 3Q, so just wondering if you can be a bit more granular in terms of where you're spending. And in particular, you referred to some price actions to drive volumes particularly in the U.S. Would that fall under investment spending? Nicholas Gangestad : I'll take the last part of that first Nigel that the changes in pricing that I talked about that would not be part of investment spending. What is included in our strategic investment spending that we called out that's impacting our margin by 70 basis points this quarter, theirs is two components. One is us taking actions on addressing our manufacturing supply chain footprint that we laid out last March at our five-year outlook meeting. We\u2019ve been taking actions and that is part of what occurred in the fourth quarter, but also what's in that is investments we're making in growth in core platforms within 3M and that was part of what we\u2019ll also laid out in December. In 2017, we are accelerating our investments of approximately $100 million in these core growth platforms. We started that investment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that makes up a little over half of the total of that strategic investment that we laid out for fourth quarter in our margin. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Nick. And then a follow-on question on FX. We have seen a fair amount of divergence in the [indiscernible], RMB weaker, the real stronger. How is that impacting the translation impact? How is that impacting your margins? And the spirit of the question is, my understanding is that your EMs are generally higher margin than DMs. Is that still the case and is there any significant margin impact from translation of the currency movements? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Nigel, what I've seen over time and what I'm seeing this quarter and into the futures it's less impacted by that particular mix, how it impacts our margin more dramatically is actually our hedging and sometimes it becomes counter intuitive Nigel that when the dollar - when we start to have the dollar stronger and negative impacts on our earnings per share from a stronger dollar. We can add for a period of time to see higher margins as our hedging gains step in and boost that margin. We have lower sales dollars from the translation, but higher margins. That's been a more impactful factor on overall margins we post and the mix of where the currencies are strengthening or weakening against the U.S. dollar. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay, I'll follow up offline. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey. So at 1.6% I mean you're already kind of getting close to the mid-point of the organic guide for the year and you've got Health Care clearly way below what you would normally expect to be at and Consumer is negative. It seems like you feel pretty good about Industrial continuing to be strong. So are there any other offsets here? Because it would seem that you'd be tracking closer to the higher end of that organic guide, all else equal, unless there's something you expect to slow. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. For 2017 Shannon, the 1% to 3% we\u2019re still right there. Yes, we like the fact where we ended in Q4 from an organic growth. But it's also in line with what we were anticipating in total, and it's in line with where we felt we needed to be for the 1% to 3% that we guided for 2017. Inge Thulin : We would like to go ahead of our self right. So I think it's important just to make important as we roll into the year and see more evidence of the positive movement, we saw here in the end. But as you said, investment we are doing the initiative we have around growth right because you look upon 3M as you see it now the efficiency in this organization is incredible and you see what we do in terms of EPS growth, free cash flow conversion, return on invested capital. We can get growth up even more that will get very good return for all of us. So that\u2019s why we focus in and make sure that we will execute on that, but we will not over promise anything to you at this point in time. Shannon O'Callaghan: Thanks. And then just on Mexico, I mean you talked about - I think you said double-digit growth there again this quarter. 3M has always been good at monitoring and managing through different global risk areas. I mean what's your current view there? Are you seeing any change in activity and do you do any kind of scenario planning around your position there in particular? Inge Thulin : No, we don't, we have had very have strong growth in Mexico for quite sometime and it is an important local market for us, right. We have been there for many, many years. In Latin America, we have a very good growth rate for this quarter and we have been in that part of the world with our domestic business since 1946, right that we start operation in Brazil 1946. We have huge operations and it's very much locally driven and that is our strategy. So 10% growth in Mexico growth in the quarter is a good result, Brazil had 1%, so look like they're coming back a little bit, but we are not changing anything as I said - as I start the call here. Our strategies around localization and if you go back to what we have talk about, we never left United States. We expanded international based on the local market opportunity, right. So I think that's how you should view 3M in the business model that we are using? Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks. Inge Thulin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge Thulin : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple things, a lot of ground covered here. First, Nick, I was just wondering, back on the December guide, although the broad strokes have not changed, are you within the range of all those individual kind of bucket items that you gave us, [down through] pension, tax, et cetera, et cetera? Inge Thulin : Jeff, yes. The short answer is, yes. A couple I\u2019ll just put on the - I'll explain. Pension I'd originally guided $0.00 to $0.10 headwind now that we have that all locked in that will be an 8% headwind for the year. And then tax rate since it ended a little lower, we\u2019re still seeing at a 28% to 29% tax rate in 2017. Back in December, I was saying I expected to be a little bit of a tailwind probably would be more neutral on for us for 2017 right now. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, and also this is for Nick, could you just update us on your stranded cash, probably all your cash is outside the U.S. or some 90%. But do you cap the break near-term on share repurchase? Waiting to see if we get some kind of repatriation or something, or do you kind of proceed as normal on the borrowing and repurchase tempo you've been on?? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, our total cash Jeff is we have just a little over $2 billion of cash outside the United States. It's not a large number. I'm sure you're aware of this Jeff. We've been going to a number of efforts to be optimizing our global optimizing our global cash position and we've been managing that global cash balance down especially our international cash balance down. So our current capital allocation plan, we can execute that without any kind of tax reform or any kind of action. And it's really too early for me to comment on if something were to happen of what we do. We're obviously prepping and preparing and will act accordingly to take advantage of whatever kind of legislation occurs, but I think it's too early for me to comment on how that would change our capital allocation right now. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks, and just finally, if you wouldn't mind, any color that you could share on January? Has there been any kind of change in behavior as we slip into the New Year, particularly in shorter cycle Industrial markets in particular would be of interest? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, just as far as the year is starting, we're not seen any kind of change in the trajectory that we were anticipating. It's consistent with what we were expecting when we guided 1% to 3% and nothing really changing out of the norm for us, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Nicholas Gangestad : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : I will ask Jeff's question in a slightly different way about what you're seeing. Inge, I think you said that there are reasons to get excited, and I was wondering if you could share any anecdotes, obviously, without changing the guidance, that makes you more excited. Inge Thulin : Yes. As I said earlier, when you look upon it in terms of our performance for this quarter and the momentum you have seen after some time where there has been slower growth right, but if you start to look upon elements that look positive for you. For me that will be like we had a good quarter in United States, right. United States grew 5% in the quarter. Japan grew 2% and China grew 11% excluding electronic. Electronic was 6% and we have had three consecutive quarters in Germany with growth. If I look upon that and I think about big economies in the world United States, Germany, Japan and China on a positive movement forward I feel better about it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overly excited because overall you also have some tempering in Central East Europe and Middle East/Africa and that will hold for some time. But I would say that that's what I see. I saw our Industrial business have a good growth and then I take those geographical pieces together. Safety and Graphics continue to have a solid performance. Health Care, I'm convinced it will come back for us. And then as I said earlier Consumer when you look upon sale in and sail out, it's not the concern. But I think if you take for all of us, the bigger picture of growth coming in the two biggest economies in the world and then you add Germany and Japan to that, if you are 3M, which is about technology conversion and demographic shift. They look slightly better today than it is six to nine months ago. Andrew Obin : Let me just ask a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted that they're seeing a meaningful, positive impact from the change in one child policy in China. What are you guys seeing in Health Care and Consumer in China? Can you identify it and does it provide any potential upside to your thinking for the second half of the year? Inge Thulin : It should by definition and if you look upon those two businesses for us in China specifically, we had 17% growth for Consumer in the quarter; we have 15% growth in Health Care for the quarter and that's a positive outcome and those business even if they are small for us, if you look upon our portfolio in China, the two biggest in size for us is Electronics and Energy, and Industrial right because of the evolution of that economy. But what will come is Consumer and Health Care. So when you\u2019re running them at 15% to 17% that's a good signal for us. We have a huge penetration opportunity there and they are both local domestic markets right, so no export by definition. Andrew Obin : And you have the capacity to meet this demand? Inge Thulin : Absolutely. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi guys, thanks for going over the hour to fit some of us in. I appreciate it. Inge Thulin : Hi, good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Lots of questions asked just on the forward look here into the early part of the year. The Street has you guys APS kind of flat year-over-year, but normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, if we adjust some of these gains et cetera out, gets you to something that's a little bit higher than that in the 210-ish range. Is there anything unusual about the year-over-year comp that we should be keeping in mind for the first quarter? Maybe just a little bit of color, I know that the Street basically has you guys flat, but they have you growing for the year. So do the trends out of the fourth quarter change that view to make you feel a little bit better about being able to grow earnings here in the first quarter? Inge Thulin : Steve for the quarters of 2017, I would call this remarkably stable year of nothing particular to call out quarter-by-quarter to be thinking about the only thing on the margin - on the hedge that I'd say is strategic investments that I talked about earlier that we started in Q4. Those will be more heavily weighted in the first part of the year. In fact I expect strategic investments in first quarter to be very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Stephen Tusa : Okay, so you expect to grow earnings in every quarter essentially? Inge Thulin : I think Steve you're trying to turn me into a quarterly guided here, for the year we\u2019re\u2026 Stephen Tusa : It\u2019s pretty vague question. Inge Thulin : Yes, I'll just leave it. We don't see a lot differentiation of the core underline business quarter-to-quarter. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So when you guys talk about strategic investment that's I would assume outside of R&D because R&D as a percentage of sales was I think down a little bit in the quarter that stuff that is not considered just R&D I would assume? Inge Thulin : A very little of our strategic investments if any is R&D. This is really about commercialized for the growth side of it. It's really about investments we're making and commercializing what we already have. Stephen Tusa : Okay, super. Thanks a lot. Inge Thulin : And Steve, just one more point, I\u2019m going to repeat a point from December. Growth we expect to be largely aligned for the year across most of our business the one exception is Health Care. I just want to remind you, we expect Health Care growth to accelerate growth to accelerate as the year goes on. Stephen Tusa : Great, thank you. Inge Thulin : Okay. Thanks Steve, Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge Thulin : Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter completed a successful year for our enterprise. In 2016 we executed our playbook and post strong financial results in terms of EPS and margins along with free cash flow and return on invested capital. At the same, we continue to simplify organization and improve our cost structure while making investments for the future. As a result, we are positioned for a strong 2017 and we'll capitalize as growth conditions improve. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentleman that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for this year's investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q2 and Q3 conference calls will be held on July 25 and October 24 respectively. Next, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars. On slide 3 are details for our upcoming European investor meeting, which will be held on June 6 and 7 at our headquarters in Neuss, Germany. We will be posting the presentation materials on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com for those that are not able to attend the meeting in person. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 4. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 5, and I'll hand the call off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team delivered a strong start to 2017. We posted good growth that was positive across all geographic areas while expanding our profitability. At the same time, we increased investments across the enterprise to accelerate organic growth and improve productivity. I will take you through the first quarter highlights. Companywide, organic local currency sales growth was 5%. Growth was led by Electronics & Energy, which grew 12% in the quarter. We have done a lot of work in this business to improve our relevance to customers and the marketplace, and those efforts are paying off. Industrial, our largest business group, had another good quarter with 6% growth, as did Safety & Graphics, which grew 5%. Health Care grew 3% organically, and we continue to expect growth in this business to accelerate further into the year. Our Consumer business declined 1% due to ongoing channel adjustments, specifically in the office and retail space. Companywide, we posted total sales of $7.7 billion along with earnings of $2.16 per share, up 5% year over year. Operating margins were 23%, which includes $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter. Excluding those investments, our core operating margins were nearly 25%, so we are executing extremely well. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 6% increase in the dividend, which marks 3M's 59th consecutive year of increases. And over the last five years, we have doubled our per share dividend. Beyond financial results, we continue to execute our three key levers, which are big value creators both today and into the future. The first if portfolio management. And in March, we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety for $2 billion. This will further strengthen our position on the fast-growing personal safety market. The second lever is investing in innovation, and in Q1 we invested $470 million in research and development, or 6.1% of sales. This includes adding more resources in the field to bring our scientists and application engineers even closer to our customers. These investments support organic growth along with our ability to constantly deliver premium margins. We also continue to move forward with a third lever, business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. It is making it easier for our customers to do business with us while creating an even more ideal and efficient 3M. The backbone of business transformation is our new ERP system, and the rollout in West Europe is nearly complete. You will hear more about this at our Investor Day in Germany on June 7. Please turn to slide 6. In addition to the three key levers, we took also other actions to prepare our enterprise for success in both the short and long term. Earlier, I mentioned the incremental $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter, which include $36 million to accelerate growth in the core platforms. These growth investments will continue throughout the year, and we expect them to contribute 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2017, which we began to see in Q1. We also took actions to strengthen the portfolio and optimize our manufacturing footprint. These actions will increase productivity and intensify our focus on larger, faster growing opportunities in the future. In summary, the first quarter was strong for 3M. We delivered good financial results while investing for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap of our first quarter sales performance. As Inge mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic businesses reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7% versus last year. As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%, led by mid-single-digit increases in both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Electronics & Energy and Health Care businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The Consumer business declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market, as Inge mentioned. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%. All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in Electronics & Energy. We also had strong growth in Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer. Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China/Hong Kong and Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China/Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically, with sales growth led by Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa grew nearly 2%. Finally, organic growth in Latin America/Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit growth in Health Care, along with solid growth in Consumer and Safety & Graphics. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong growth, at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%. Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAAP operating margins were 23.1%, down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1. Earlier, you heard Inge mention the additional $136 million of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins. Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points. Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered savings in excess of market price changes. We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive for the full year. Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year on year. Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter GAAP earnings increased 5.4%, to $2.16 per share. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings. Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts. The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments were a $0.16 impact. The first quarter tax rate was 23.7%, versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share. The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year on year, which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share. Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders. First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year on year, largely due to the timing of pension contributions. Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 million to $500 million, similar to 2016. Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year, we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%. Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Let's now review our performance by business group, staring with Industrial on slide 11. Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4, delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based, across all businesses and geographic areas. Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial, increasing double digits organically. Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points. Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits. Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million, with operating margins of 23.1%. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year on year, or up 40 basis points adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain. As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017. For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5% versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%. Please turn to slide 12. First quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were up 4.8% organically to $1.5 billion. Personal safety, another Heartland business, delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits, with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. The roofing granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter, posting double-digit organic growth, as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically in all areas, led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. Operating income for the business group was $399 million, and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last, operating margins were up 80 basis points. As with Industrial, Safety & Graphics is off to a strong start, and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year. We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5% versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%. Please turn to slide 13. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 3.1% year on year, in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%. Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety. Our medical consumables businesses, which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted good growth in Q1. Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter, a marked improvement from the second half of 2016. Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically. We expect the business to improve throughout the year. Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was positive in all areas, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America/Canada and Asia-Pacific. We saw notable strength in China/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $434 million, and margins remained strong at 30.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $21 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business. Please turn to slide 14. Electronics & Energy led our company with organic growth of 11.5% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.2 billion. The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team successfully drove increased penetration on a number of OEM platforms. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics, which also boosted our growth rate, and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps. Our Energy-related businesses were up 1% organically, with low single-digit growth in electrical markets, while telecom was flat. On a geographic basis, organic growth was up double digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $225 million, with margins of 18.6%, up 70 basis points. Adjusting for first quarter portfolio actions, margins were nearly 24%, up 600 basis points year on year. As you can see, Q1 organic growth was very robust for Electronics & Energy. As a result, we are updating our full-year growth expectations for this business to a range of up 1% to 6% versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%. The first half of the year is expected to be stronger than the second half, largely driven by year-on-year comps. Please turn to slide 15. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, and organic growth declined 1.2% year on year. Three of our four businesses within Consumer grew organically, again led by home improvement followed by consumer health care and home care. Within the home improvement business, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth, as accelerated investments continue to pay off. Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. More than offsetting this growth was a year-on-year decline in our stationery and office supplies business, which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America/Canada, which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S. Operating income was $222 million, with operating margins of 21.3%. Looking at the full year, we expect organic growth for Consumer to be in the range of 1% to 3% versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%. We also expect to see growth improve as the year progresses. Please turn to slide 16. Before I turn it back to Inge, let me address a few items that we anticipate will happen over the remainder of 2017. The net impact of these items is factored into our EPS guidance today. First, as you may recall, in December we announced the divestiture of our Identity Management business within Safety & Graphics. The sale of this business, which has annual sales of approximately $205 million, is expected to close during the second quarter. Upon completion, we expect to record a gain on sale of approximately $0.55 per share, partially offset by the profit that will go with the business in 2017 after the divestiture is closed. In addition, recall at our Investor Meeting in March 2016, we introduced a plan to better optimize our portfolio and supply chain footprint. We expect to make significant progress on that plan in 2017, with associated costs in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share over the remainder of the year. We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share will incur in Q2. In total, the net impact of these items is expected to add between $0.05 and $0.10 to 2017 earnings per share. Again, this impacted is reflected in our full-year updated guidance, which Inge will now cover on slide 17. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As you have seen, our team delivered a very strong start to the year. As a result, today we are raising our full-year expectations for both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth in 2017 of 2% to 5% versus a prior range of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we expect earnings of $8.70 to $9.05, up 7% to 11% versus a prior range of $8.45 to $8.80. Finally, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion in 2017. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you talk about the uptick in strategic investments that you're making a little more? You said that you were going to do $0.05 to $0.10 of investments in 2017, but you did $0.16 in the quarter. A lot of that seems to be in E&E and Health Care. You mentioned the increased growth, where you expect the 50 to 100 basis points. How much did you see in the first quarter? And can you classify these moves as a lot more offensive to gain share, or maybe more defensive, in E&E especially, given that you've had some share impact from OLED for instance? So how do you characterize it all? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Andy, thanks for the question. You covered quite a few things there. Just from an overall theme standpoint, Andy, we're always looking for opportunities to enhance the value of the enterprise, and that's really part of our business model. What you see in the first quarter for incremental investments, some of that was investments we were taking to accelerate growth. And that was really lined up with what we had shared last December of the incremental $100 million over the course of 2017 to deliver accelerated growth throughout the year. The other context I'd share with you in thinking about this step up in strategic investments, if you think back to last March at our investor meeting when we laid out our five-year plan, we shared plans for optimizing our portfolio and supply chain footprint with at that time what we described a total of between $500 million and $600 million of investments, and ultimately that we expected that by 2020 to be creating $125 million to $175 million of annualized benefit, operating income benefit. What you're seeing in this step up of accelerated strategic investments both for the quarter and for the year is us taking more action related to what we laid out last year for the optimized actions on our supply chain footprint. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. That's helpful, Nick. And then shifting gears, your guidance of 2% to 5% expected growth in Industrial, you did 5.7% in the first quarter. Comparisons do get a little harder, especially in 4Q, we know that. But your Industrial business also seems to have momentum entering the second quarter. So what do you think could slow down as the year goes on? How much of the new guidance is conservatism versus concerns around things like auto OE? Or is anything else in the investor portfolio slowing? Or is this just it's early in the year and you've seen a nice uptick in the businesses and you do expect momentum here as you go into 2Q? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hi. Good morning, Andrew. This is Inge. What I think you should look, first of all, we see good momentum globally for the Industrial business, and you can see that also then going over to our Safety & Graphics business. So both of them are doing slightly better than we thought when we started the year. And you can see, we changed the range not only for the company but for those two businesses specifically, from 1% to 3% to 2% to 5%. It is early in the year, so we don't see at this point in time anything specifically that will slow. But I think a range of 2% to 5% is more realistic at this point in time. And when you look upon Industrial, there was in the United States very good growth for us, and the same in West Europe. And I just came back from China two weeks ago, and you can see a slight momentum upwards there as well. So we are raising it now to 2% to 5%, and we will maybe, of course, talk more about it as we have maybe one more, two more quarters under our belts here. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So maybe staying on the growth point for a second, so clearly really strong organic growth quarter. I'm just curious. As the quarter progressed, did the things \u2013 did momentum continue to get better? Was there any particular month that was better than others? I'm just trying to understand, I guess, really in the context of the full-year guidance. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Joe, as the quarter went on, it was consistent strength across the quarter, all three months of the quarter. And I'd further add, we're seeing April, the start of April, tracking very much in line with what we've been seeing for the first quarter, so really no intra-quarter trend changes to note. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then I guess, maybe taking two of those businesses and talking for a second about Electronics, which had a great quarter at plus 11% and change, and the guidance for the rest of the year, and the expectation for what you expect will be the shift to OLED over the next couple quarters, and then contrasting that maybe with the Consumer business, which has been a really stable business for you guys for quite some time, and whether you think that there are maybe some structural versus cyclical pressures that you're seeing there. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, if we start with Electronics & Energy, as I said earlier, we have done a lot of work in that business during the last couple of years, in order to make sure that we have the right structure in place. And I think those are the things that you see, in terms of action we are making on the portfolio, some right-sizing on manufacturing, et cetera. But what also had been going on for quite some time is our shifting of commercialization capabilities into faster-growing businesses in Electronics & Energy. And we will continue, of course, to look upon consumer electronics, utilities, construction, and semiconductor. But over time here, for the last couple of years, we have shifted more into data center, to automotive electrification, to energy grid, and communication infrastructure. So that's a move over time, and that starts to pay off. And your comment on OLED, there is no change to what we laid out earlier in the year. But one thing that you need to understand with our \u2013 we are global. So what we see in what you call consumer electronics, we are going on big platforms for the Chinese OEMs as we speak. So I think we have a tendency to over-rely on the United States enterprises, in terms of that platform. And as I said, came back from China two weeks ago, and the progress we are making on platforms out there on consumer electronics is just fantastic. So I will say, on that business, the things that you see in terms of actions, but there's also things that we have done, in terms of shifting our focus into faster-growing businesses. And I think we showed that at the last investor meeting, where we talked of (33:50) moving more capabilities into $12 billion market opportunity that is growing 10% to 15%. So that's the piece you see. So I'm very, very pleased, I would say, with the hard work that business had done in order to manage the cost and efficiency, and then type of shift to faster growing markets. In terms of Consumer, Consumer had basically, this quarter, three or four division was growing. One division was down, and it's basically into United States, and it's into the office channels. When we look upon that now, for the second quarter in a row, our sale-out is 2%, but our sale-in is down. So I think it would take us a couple of more quarters in order for the inventory levels to come right in that channel. It's not a 3M issue. It's maybe an issue relative to consolidation in that channel that is pretty robust, I will say, if you follow what is going on into that channel. And when we looked upon the growth for Consumer around the world, we had robust growth everywhere except in Central/East Europe, Middle/East Africa, we were down 2%. And then, as Nick said, in the United States we were down 5%, all into the office supply. But if you look upon the rest, it was very good growth. We had China/Hong Kong 40%, Canada 5%, Latin America 2%, and total international was actually 4% growth. So let's see how long time it will take for the channel to adjust. I cannot predict that as I sit here, but probably another two quarters or so. Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you for the color. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi, thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Good morning. I just wanted to start with the pricing side. I think core price in your EBIT margin bridge was flat in the first quarter. It was down slightly in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about price overall for the balance of the year, versus that figure in Q1? And I noticed your U.S. pricing, at least in your revenue commentary, is still negative. Do you think that will turn up in the balance of the year? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Julian, we're not fundamentally seeing any change in our pricing power. That remains strong. We do continue to look for targeted places where we can use price to help drive organic volume growth. If I look out over total 2017, we're expecting U.S. price growth to be approximately flat. If I expand it to the total globe, if I pull out the FX impact, we expect pricing to be up slightly. Our normal range is 30 to 50 basis points of core price growth. I think it will be somewhere between there and flat for total 2017. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thank you very much. And then my second question was just around the strategic investments. I was just trying to square some of the different numbers. Is the sense that the higher operating leverage you're getting from the better organic growth, you're redeploying most of that into growth-related strategic investments, and then the majority of the gain you're getting you're redeploying into cost or COGS-related reduction efforts? Is that a fair summary, or is there something going on in the end markets that's also driving some of this stepped-up spending? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, of the $136 million in strategic investments in the first quarter, Julian, a little less than half of that is investments that we see having a fairly short-term return in 2017 and into early 2018. And those are primarily growth-oriented investments, and those growth-oriented investments were factored into the guidance we set out for the year. The remainder of the strategic investments, those relate to our portfolio, supply chain footprint. And that's really laid out aligned closely with the plan that we put forward a year ago in March. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Understood. So in your initial EPS bridge from December, the $0.05 to $0.10 of strategic investment headwind, that correlates fairly closely with that $0.40 to $0.45 portfolio and footprint actions you called out in today's slide 16? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Not entirely, but it's a different line is it? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, so in December when we laid out our guidance, EPS guidance for the year, strategic investments we had incrementally in a $0.05 to $0.10 range. That was aligned primarily \u2013 or almost exclusively with our growth investments. Now what you're seeing, we're seeing the growth investments play out exactly as we guided, still in that $0.05 to $0.10 range for the total year. What we're layering on top of that is additional footprint actions and portfolio actions that we're taking throughout 2017. So on top of the growth investments, there's roughly an incremental $0.10 of supply chain and portfolio actions that we took in the first quarter of 2017. And then in terms of the guidance for the balance of this year, for Q2, Q3, and Q4, there's an extra $0.40 to $0.45 on top of that that was not part of our initial guidance. So all in, the growth investments, the incremental $0.10 that we took in the first quarter plus what we're expecting Q2 through Q4, it's now in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 for the total year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : That's really helpful. Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: At the risk of \u2013 yes, good morning, guys. At the risk of flogging that dead horse to death, so the timing of the accelerated investments in 1Q, is it because you saw you had a tax benefit and then therefore you decided to offset that? Does that explain the timing of the investments? And should we think of this as more of a pull forward from \u2013 you mentioned the $0.05 to $0.10 of growth investments. It sounds like all that's been made in 1Q, so this is a pull forward, Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Nigel, we're always, as I said earlier, we're always looking for opportunities. The level that we were investing in Q1 in strategic investments around growth, no pull forward there. That's coming exactly as we had planned. The increased strategic investments around portfolio actions and the supply chain footprint, that's aligned with our longer-term vision. The exact timing of when we were going to do that we did not have clarity on until we started pulling the trigger on some of those actions in the first quarter and some that we expect to have happen over the next three quarters. So I'm not sure I'd characterize it as a pull forward as much as it would be now is the time that it looked like the right time for us to pull the trigger on actions that we had laid out last March. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the revised guidance, does this bake in anything for Scott Safety, or is that still outside of the guidance? And I'm wondering if maybe the $0.40 to $0.45 of actions maybe includes the $0.10 of dilution from Scott. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, the $0.40 to $0.45 does not include anything for Scott Safety. At the time that closes, we will update guidance to take into account any impact that will have on our 2017 earnings. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and then just one quick one. Some companies have talked about the benefit from channel restock. I'm just wondering. What sort of intel do you have on sell-in versus sell-outs? Did you see any restocking? It looks like our checks (43:10) might have been, but any color there would be helpful. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, first of all, you heard Inge talked about some of the channel impacts in our office retail and wholesale channel. In addition, in our Industrial channel, we are seeing increased confidence in the channel, which we're seeing good sell-out of our product. We're seeing even stronger sell-in to the industrial channel, primarily in the U.S. So that is one place where we're attributing it to higher confidence amongst that channel and seeing what appears to be some restocking of depleted channel levels that we've seen in the past. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, I was hoping to circle back on Consumer and the stationery office commentary. This came up in the fourth quarter. And, Inge, you gave us some good color in terms of the sale-in and sale-out as the destocking going on. We can see and read about all the consolidation in this channel, but I was interested in hearing your commentary about e-commerce because that is a growing factor in these products. And how was this captured in your channel descriptions and categories? Are you calling the brick-and-mortar customers a part of your channel overall? Does that include their e-commerce? And so how does e-commerce factor into this? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, it does. So e-commerce is one channel of many for us. And if you think about the total enterprise, in a quarter like this, our e-channel sales is north of $200 million, and we are growing 6% in that channel generally as a total company. International actually grew 25% in e-business for the quarter. So it is an element. And so for us, we look upon our customers in terms of one channel. Then inside of them, they have omni-channel, et cetera, which they are utilizing. And as you have seen, when you \u2013 I cannot talk about them. We have to look upon their reports. But as you see, for many of them, the \"e\" part is growing very, very fast, and it's type of slower growth in the traditional business, if you like. And that's the same for us then when we look upon our \u2013 as our output in terms of growth. But as I said, for that channel, generally speaking it is the United States at this point in time that are consolidating as a total channel. The e-channel is growing I think for most of our customers, and we are part of that. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's real helpful. And then just over on Health Care and oral care specifically, one of your key competitors was seeing destocking in this business on the consumables side. It looked like you didn't suffer from that. Is it easier comps? Have you seen the destocking trend over? And maybe you can comment on the sell-in versus sell-through. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: We did not see what you're describing here. We saw maybe a little bit more confidence actually into the channel on our products. So we took market share on the consumable part into the oral care, and I think there's momentum there. So we had 5% growth, and I think the momentum and the confidence with the retailers is very high for our products as you move forward into the year. So I think it's a combination of us taking market share and also the retailer, as Nick said, for Industrial specifically, we have good confidence as we move into the year and maybe build a little bit of inventory, but it's not the majority of the growth. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful, thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : A couple loose ends here. First just on Electronics, you actually raised the range, particularly a wider range with one quarter in your pocket already. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on what the big swing factors are as you think about how the rest of the year plays out for you specifically. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: First of all, I think the positive is that we changed the guidance north. We extended the range a little bit, and that's based on, I would say, very positive outlook that we have as we move in on some of the platforms, specifically out in Asia. And as I said earlier, we have worked for quite some time relative to our commercialization capabilities into market segments that are growing faster. And I talked about data center. I talked about automotive electrification and energy grids and communication infrastructure. That is starting to pay off. So I will say that it looked positive, but it's still early. But as you see, we go rather 1% to 6% than 1% to 5%. This may be indicating the positive signs that we see in that business in terms of growth. And of course, margins have improved dramatically the last couple of years. And as you see again, this quarter we took some actions that we could do and still deliver very, very good margins for that business. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Are there some specific OEM wins that really drive how this plays out that you don't have visibility on yet, or is it just an end market demand question? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, there are also wins, and that will of course especially now and the sales will come later. But as I said earlier, I think we have a tendency to think about 3M as a U.S. company. We are a global company. So we work on platforms all over the world. And as you know, out in Asia there are very big movements coming from the Chinese OEMs relative to this space. And they're all spec'ing in our products as they move ahead. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just a couple quick cleanups for Nick, if I could. Nick, on tax, have you solved your 2017 tax rate down to what you think your ongoing sustainable tax rate is going to be, or do we have more downside as we look forward? And also just on the $136 million of spend, where was it precisely? I think $21 million in Health Care and maybe it was $70 million to $75 million in E&E. Is that right? Where was the rest of it? Thank you. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Jeff, to your first question on the tax rate for what we're now seeing for total 2017, there are a few dynamics going on. First of all, we are seeing a favorable geographic profit mix for us that is helping us in our tax rate. It's been a headwind for us the last couple years, and that's switching over to a tailwind for us this year. We're also seeing some of the benefits, as you'd expect, from some of our tax planning. But one of the more significant items just in the first quarter is the benefit we're getting from the accounting standard change that came into effect last year for the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. From a year-on-year basis, that's about a $0.04 benefit versus what we had a year ago. And, Jeff, I'd say that's the wildcard. Other things are going very much as we had planned, to get to the 27% tax rate by 2020. But with the added variability from what happens with this excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, there will be some quarters that's a benefit, and some quarters we won't see any benefit at all. All in, we're well on track for hitting the 27% in 2020, possibly even lower than that. But when we have better clarity on that, we'll give a revised number of, can that go even lower than the 27%. To the second point on the strategic investments, the $136 million, of the growth-related investments, you're correct. Health Care had the majority of that. There were small amounts, single digits of millions of dollars, low to mid-single digits in millions of dollars, in the other four business groups. And then, from a portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization, the vast majority of that is impacting the Electronics & Energy business, with a little of that hitting the consumer and office business, the Consumer business group. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you hear me? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. So this is more of a longer-term question. Obviously, listen, you're a global company, you've been making investments with the perspective of a multi-year view, which is obviously wise and prudent, but you are dealing with geopolitical headwinds, across-the-border volatility. How do you think about the investments you've made, particularly in global excellence, particularly in the Eurozone? If we see an increased risk of a breakup there, is there actions you're going to have to take? How are you going to react to some of these black swans with respect to perhaps increased nationalism? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: First of all, as you know, we have done business in international for many, many years, so we have a good understanding of the ins and outs relative to different parts of the world. And I will say that the way that 3M emerged and developed itself over years have been country by country, and starting with a sales office, then becoming a subsidiary, adding in technical capabilities and then manufacturing, et cetera. And I think, the last 10 years or so, we have start more to regionalize and be more efficient, specifically around supply chain and manufacturing, where we still have continued to execute commercially in every country because, as you know, this is \u2013 in most cases, different languages and in some cases, different currency. I don't think there will be much of a change as we move forward, to be honest, and if so, we have to adjust to that. So I think we have had experiences in the past where we need to change the business model geographically, based on what is happening in that specific area from time to time. And we can go back as early 1990s where the European Union was formed, and the way we changed the structure at that point in time, in order to serve the European market with free goods flowing, people able to move in-between countries, and there will be one currency for all countries in Europe. Now, that didn't really play out the way that that was laid out and that was figured out, not last year, not two years ago. That was figured out 10 years ago. And we adjusted again to that, and have been successful ever since in those geographical areas. So, it's difficult to talk about specifics here today, because we don't know what will happen, but I can guarantee you one thing, that we are diverse enough in our management, and we have experience enough, both in United States and overseas, in order to adjust our business model at any point in time in order to serve our customers. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just as a follow-up to that, I think one thing about the ERP investment, the global excellence investments, is ultimately looking at SKU rationalization around the company. But if you have this countercyclical trend of increased nationalism and perhaps higher trade barriers and less regionalization, doesn't that cap the upside from SKU rationalization? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Not necessarily. I think that the business transformation we put in place will serve us very well for the future, despite what will happen in terms of things in Asia and Europe, et cetera. I think we will see \u2013 people are rational relative to growth. So people will understand and see that fewer distribution centers are better because, by definition, you can serve the customers in a more efficient way, to a lower cost. So reality is, when everything is \u2013 all cards is putting down in place, people understand that is the most effective way to do business, and it will enhance growth of the economies around the world and Europe specifically, as you talk about it. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just a last follow-up. Has there been any change in your outlook, in terms of CapEx or investment, with respect to automation in your facilities for the last 18 to 24 months? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Rob, as far as the automation portion of our CapEx spending, a year ago at our investor meeting, we laid out that we expected that to be a noticeable part of our CapEx investments. What we're seeing is, that's playing out exactly as we laid out a year ago, that we're seeing continued opportunities for automation investments within our CapEx plans. And I wouldn't call it an uptick, but I'd say it's playing out exactly as we laid out. Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Inge, I can't remember a time where we had 5% core growth in Western Europe, and I'm trying to figure out whether this is just a weak euro and most of that is just export markets. Or is it really broad-based, both internal consumption plus export, given your experience in running Europe for so many years? Maybe you can give us a little bit of color around what you see in Europe, and what you think the outlook is for the rest of the year more specifically? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So first of all, it was broad-based, where we saw \u2013 if you first talk about business groups, all business groups, except one, had growth of \u2013 we had one that grew 5%, which was Industrial, so you have 5% in Industrial for the whole of West Europe. You have 6% for Safety & Graphics. You take those two businesses together, which is into the industrial sector very much, we'll say, you looked upon 5% to 6% there, and it was broad-based. Electronic was up to 7%, and then it was slow in Health Care and Consumer. In fact, Consumer, that is a very small business for us in Europe, was actually flat. So you look upon that, it was broad-based, with growth of I will say 4% to 6% in the most important business for us. There was no big change on the country side, but you can see countries that have been slow in the past like Spain \u2013 it will now be called Iberia \u2013 are coming up, but that's very much due to comparison for them. But I will say there's positive momentum, driven very much out from Germany, I will say, and that's broad-based and it's of course starting in Industrial and Safety & Graphics. So it was very good and it was not one-time shot as I see it. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, so there's some sustainability to it? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So I know there's been a half dozen questions on this, but I'm not sure I got the answer or the answer was clear. If core growth positively surprises \u2013 I think you're being reasonably conservative the rest of the year. Will your growth investments need to accelerate from these levels, or are these new levels that you've stated the new line in the sand for 2017? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Scott, the increase in the strategic investments from what we originally guided is really around supply chain and portfolio optimization and much less around growth. If we see growth even higher than what we're currently expecting, could our growth investments tick up some? I think the short answer is yes. It could tick up some, but I don't think on a material basis. I think we're now talking single digits of pennies at that point. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: As you remember, Scott, we laid out for the year, actually I think it was $100 million to $105 million in those investments that we call core surge, core platforms. And $36 million was there the first quarter, and we started already last year to load into those opportunities. And we see the result coming, so that's the positive thing. So the growth coming this quarter, I will say that there's been a lot of work there that is in my view both the microscope and a telescope. The microscope is to make the investment and get growth going. And then you saw some of that investment we did in strategic investment is a type of a telescope. This will create very good value for 3M and for the shareholders as we go ahead. So if you think about what we did here this quarter, I think if you look upon it as a playbook, this is right what you would like to do in order to build both short term that most of us are focused on, but also for the mid to long term for shareholders for 3M. So I think it was the right thing to do. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, good color. Thank you, guys, and good luck. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you just remind us what exactly when you talk about supply chain rationalization, what exactly that is? Is this just a fancy way to talk about restructuring? Or just remind us in I guess the most brief way, since we're coming to the end of the call, what exactly some of those actions are. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Steve, thanks for the question. Part of what we talked about a little over a year ago at our outlook meeting, for the five-year outlook meeting, is the number of manufacturing sites we have around the world and looking at the productivity in those sites and the opportunity we have through rationalizing the number of those sites, increasing capital into some of our more productive sites, the opportunity to reduce the total footprint of our manufacturing and supply chain sites over the course of the next four years. So that's what we mean when we talk about it when we laid out a $500 million to $600 million investment that we expect to take, the resulting productivity from that, that by the time we get to 2020 we think that will add another $125 million to $175 million of added operating income through that productivity we can get through rationalizing our supply chain footprint. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right, okay. That makes a ton of sense, and one last question just on price/cost. Outside of Electronics, was there anywhere where price was negative? I know it was 0.1% or whatever, so there probably \u2013 maybe outside of Electronics it wasn't. I'm not sure. Just maybe a little bit of color on where, if there is any, there was price pressure outside of Electronics. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: If I look at this globally, Steve, we had positive though very small price in all businesses except for Health Care, where we were flat. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys, just two very quick ones. First on the restructuring costs in Q2, any segments in particular where margins would be noticeably distorted? And secondly, as you think about the cadence from 2017 to 2018, do you now think your growth investments and restructuring costs will be flat year over year, or do you think they'll be a bit of a tailwind into 2018? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Laurence, to the first question on business, and I'll go further in geography, we expect that this action that we're taking in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarter will impact all businesses and all geographies, that it will be broad. As far as the specific details of each business, we're still working through those details. We're not ready to be sharing that yet, Laurence. And then as far as 2017 to 2018, some of these actions will have a tail into 2018, where there will be residual cost impacts hitting us in 2018, though I expect it will not \u2013 I very much expect it will be a decline from the level that we're projecting now for 2017. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. To wrap up, this was a very strong quarter for 3M in terms of healthy broad-based growth, increased earnings per share, and good execution across each of our business groups and functions. Equally important, we made additional investment to support growth and productivity for the remainder of 2017 and well into the future. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.",

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q3 earnings conference call will be held on October 24, the Q4 call will be next year on January 25. And lastly, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For 3M the second quarter was marked by strong organic growth of 4% with positive growth across all five business groups. At the same time, we took a number of actions to better position our enterprise for success in both the short and long-term. This includes accelerated strategic investments to support growth and strengthening our portfolio along with M&A. I will now take you through some of the numbers. As I mentioned, organic growth across the company was 4% led by Electronics and Energy at 8%. Industrial, and Safety and Graphics continued to grow well posting organic growth of 4% and 3% respectively. Health Care also grew 3% and it was good to see our Consumer business turn positive with 1% organic growth. Company-wide total sales in U.S. dollars were $7.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. We delivered earnings of $2.58 per share along with margins of 28%. Note that these results include impacts from both M&A and strategic investments, which Nick will cover in more detail. Excluding those impacts, core operating margins remained strong at more than 24%. Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 85% in the second quarter. Our healthy cash flow enabled us to invest in enterprise by also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening remarks and I will now turn the call over to Nick who will take us through more of the numbers. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5. As Inge mentioned, GAAP earnings for the quarter were $2.58 per share. Since we had several moving parts this quarter, I thought I would take a moment to cover each item to make our underlying second quarter performance as clear as possible. As Inge mentioned, we continue to execute our plans in Q2 to strengthen the company for the future. During the quarter, we made incremental strategic investments of $178 million; $39 million was growth related and $139 million related to portfolio and footprint actions. For the second half of the year, we anticipate another $0.20 to $0.25 per share impact from incremental strategic investments, largely footprint related. These actions drive greater productivity from our manufacturing and supply chain base and will improve our service to our customers. Looking ahead, we expect footprint actions to be, at a minimum, an expense of $0.10 per share in 2018. This expectation includes benefits from actions implemented in 2017. In addition, we had divestiture related activity in the quarter which added $0.57 to GAAP earnings per share, of which $0.54 relates to the identity management business. Taking into account these items, underlying earnings were $2.25 per share, up 8.2% year-on-year. Please turn to slide 6 for a recap of our quarterly sales performance. We posted good organic growth in the quarter of 3.5%, with volumes up a solid 3.8%. Selling prices were down 30 basis points year-on-year due to a couple of factors. Strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price, and we saw less price growth in Latin America as currencies were more stable versus the U.S. dollar. We continued to actively manage the portfolio in Q2 and divested some non-strategic businesses which reduced sales by 100 basis points. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 60 basis points. All in, second quarter sales, in U.S. dollars, increased 1.9% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 1.9%, led by a mid-single digit increase in Industrial. Our Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. The Consumer business was down 1% organically in the U.S. in Q2, impacted by continued channel adjustments in the office market. Asia Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10% in Q2. All business groups within APAC posted strong growth in the quarter, including a double-digit increase in Electronics and Energy and high single-digit growth in each of our other four business groups. Organic growth was 17% in China/Hong Kong and 8% in Japan. Excluding our electronics related businesses, China/Hong Kong grew 12% and Japan was up 4%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth declined 2% in Q2, with a similar result in West Europe. This area experienced fewer billing days versus last year due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Through the first half of the year, EMEA grew 1% organically, led by our Safety and Graphics and Industrial businesses. Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 4%, with all businesses posting positive growth. Health Care led the way, up high single-digits and Consumer grew mid-single digits. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong organic growth at 8%. Brazil was up 6% while Canada grew 3%. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in our full-year expectations, which Inge will discuss later. Please turn to slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.8 billion with net income of $1.6 billion, up 23%. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margins were 28%, or 24.3% year-over-year excluding the previously mentioned impact from incremental strategic investments and divestitures. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 60 basis points to operating margins. Lower raw material costs net of selling price changes added another 10 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down 50 basis points in the quarter, while higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points. Finally, incremental strategic investments reduced margins by 2.3 percentage points and divestiture related activity benefited margins by 6 percentage points. Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, including a net earnings benefit of $0.33 per share from the combined impact of gains on divestitures which were partially offset by incremental strategic investments and non-repeating lost operating earnings. Excluding these items, our operating EPS was $2.25, up 8.2% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.08 per share to Q2 earnings. Business transformation continues to have a positive impact on our productivity efforts. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.05 a share. Our Q2 tax rate was 26% versus 29.6% in the prior year, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, our supply chain centers of expertise, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. For the first half of the year, our tax rate was 25%. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% versus a prior range of 26% to 27.5%. Finally, lower shares outstanding and higher interest expense together had a net $0.02 positive impact to EPS. Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $378 million year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter. And for the full year, we now anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 100%, versus 95% to 105% previously. The adjustment to the high end of the range is primarily due to the gain on sale of identity management. Second quarter capital expenditures were $302 million, and for the full year we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $701 million in cash dividends to shareholders and also returned $494 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $1.2 billion in stock and now expect full-year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion versus $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion previously. Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth delivering second quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 3.8% organically. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and nearly all businesses. Advanced materials led the way with low double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive and aerospace solutions business grew mid-single digits in the quarter as we continue to grow the market. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, all posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits, and abrasives and automotive aftermarket, each grew low single digits. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $523 million with an operating margin of 19.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 21.5%, down nearly 200 basis points year-on-year. Half of the decline was due to foreign currency with the remainder from mix and select pricing actions to drive volume growth. Looking ahead, we expect operating leverage in the business to improve in the second half of the year. Please turn to slide 11. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.5 billion with organic growth of 3.2%. Organic growth was led by our personal safety business which again delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions across the world with particular strength in Asia Pacific, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in the U.S. In transportation safety, we continue to take actions to improve the portfolio. In Q2 we finalized the sale of the identity management and tolling businesses and announced the exit of electronic monitoring. For almost 80 years, 3M has pioneered industry-leading solutions to improve road safety and mobility. We continue to focus on the rapidly changing trends in transportation safety and mobility including the connected roadways of the future. Finally, Q2 organic growth in our commercial solutions business was flat while the roofing granules business declined, primarily due to tough year-on-year comps. Geographically, Safety and Graphics grew organically in all areas led by a 9% increase in Asia Pacific. Second quarter profits in Safety and Graphics more than doubled year-on-year to $852 million, boosted by divestiture gain. Adjusting for these items and strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 27.1%. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in drug delivery systems followed by food safety which was up high single-digits. Our medical consumables businesses which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted 3% organic growth in Q2. Health Information Systems was flat year-on-year and delivered sequential improvement. Looking ahead, we expect organic growth to improve in this business throughout the balance of the year as our contract pipeline continues to build. Oral care was flat in Q2 with the first half of the year up 2%. Geographically, Health Care was led by high single-digit organic growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada. The U.S. grew 3% and EMEA declined mid-single digits. We saw a notable strength in China/Hong Kong and Latin America which were both up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $412 million and operating margins were 28.6%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 30.6%. Please turn to slide 13. Electronics and Energy continued to lead our company with second quarter organic growth of 8.4%, resulting in sales of $1.2 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 15% organically, as our team continued to drive increased penetration on many OEM platforms. For example, our Novec specialty fluid grew high teens as we continue to see strong demand for its many applications. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics and we continue to benefit from favorable year-on-year comps. Our energy related businesses were down 3% organically with electrical flat while telecom declined. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in Asia Pacific which is where our electronics business is concentrated. Latin America/Canada grew slightly, U.S. was flat while EMEA declined. Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $301 million with operating margins of 24.8%. As you can see, Q2 was another strong quarter for our Electronics and Energy business. Please turn to slide 14. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 0.7% which was an improvement versus recent quarters. We continue to see positive organic growth in three of our four consumer businesses namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care. As expected, our stationery and office supplies business was again impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. office retail and wholesale channels, although these growth headwinds were lower in Q2 versus Q1. We expect to see these channel adjustments continue, but to have less of an impact in the back half of the year. We are seeing a good return on accelerated investments in some of our key category defining brands. For example, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth and we also delivered good growth in Scotch-Brite cleaning products. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada, both up high single-digits. This growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA. Finally, operating income was $195 million with an operating margin of 17.2%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 22.2%. Please turn to slide 15 and I will now turn the call back over Inge. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As I look upon the first six months of the year, I'm pleased with the performance from our global team. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook while delivering strong growth and premium returns. On the left hand side of this chart, you see the first half numbers. Robust earnings of $4.74 per share. Organic growth of 4%, margins of more than 25%, up 130 basis points year-on-year or up 40 basis points excluding the impact of M&A and strategic investments, and a free cash flow conversion rate of 70%. Equally important, we were active in taking action to strengthen 3M today and into the future. As you heard Nick discussed, we accelerated strategic investments in the first half which include an incremental $75 million to support growth in core platforms. This growth investments will continue throughout the year and they will contribute 50 basis points to 100 basis points of growth in 2017. We also invested another $239 million in the first half to optimize our portfolio and manufacturing footprint. This is part of the five-year plan we laid out in March of 2016 at our investor day in St. Paul, and we are making good progress executing that plan. These investments are important to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of our enterprise. Beyond strategic investment, we also continue to make good progress on our three key levers. The first is portfolio management and in March we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety which should close in the second half of this year. This acquisition will complement organic growth and further improve our position in the fast-growing personal safety market. In the first half, we also finalized three divestitures and announced another one. Ultimately, selling the businesses will allow us to focus on our biggest and best opportunities and create the greatest value for our shareholders. Investing in innovation is the second lever. In the first half, we invested $944 million in research and development or 6% of sales. These investments support organic growth while enabling us to deliver premium margins and return on invested capital. The third lever is business transformation which starts and ends with our customers. At our Investor Day last month in Neuss, Germany, many of you saw the good progress we are making with the rollout of the ERP system in West Europe. Our business transformation plan is on track and I remain confident going forward. In summary, our team delivered a strong first half performance. We're executing our strategies, building for the future and posting a good financial performance. As a result, today we are raising the bottom end of our full-year guidance for both earnings per share and organic growth which you will see on slide 16. With respect to EPS, we now anticipate earnings of $8.80 to $9.05 per share, up 8% to 11% versus last year, against the prior range of $8.70 to $9.05. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5%, up from the previous range of 2% to 5%. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong results in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion for the full year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andy. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Nick, can you give us more color on what's going on with your ability to price? You mentioned the electronics pricing impact in APAC, the U.S. pricing continues to drift down. You did preview price versus raw as getting less positive as the year went on and it did stay positive during the quarter, but could you talk about your confidence that it will stay positive as the year continues? And then the negative pricing, you're seeing more choice and a market share gain for you or is it simply more competition? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Andy, in the case of pricing both for the quarter and for the year, we're not \u2013 if I think about 3M's business model, where we take technology, use that to create value for the customers, that ultimately creates our fundamental pricing power. That hasn't changed. That remains strong. For the second quarter, we saw price down 30 basis points and as you mentioned we saw it down approximately 40 basis points in the U.S. On a global basis, what we're seeing, Andy, is two main things that have changed from first quarter are strong growth in electronics which was much more of a price down that the other businesses that we saw that strong volume growth there contributed to more negative price growth in Asia Pacific. And then in Latin America, where we often see price growth often driven by a weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, we saw much more stable currencies there versus the U.S. dollar, so some of the corresponding price growth we see didn't materialize. The core price growth and this gets into what we saw in the United States. Core price growth, we traditionally see somewhere between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of core price growth. In the U.S., we see ourselves now tracking to the low end of what we've been expecting for price growth. We expect it to be closer to flat for the total year in the U.S. And we are taking in some markets selected price adjustments to gain market share, to accelerate volume growth. Some examples are our Industrial business and our Consumer business. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, Nick. That's helpful. And then, Inge, can you give us a little more color on what's going on in your Health Care business? You've talked about seeing an acceleration in that business? Health Care also seems like the biggest target for your growth investments that are supposed to boost growth in that segment this year, yet you did see some deceleration in the quarter. Obviously, the deceleration looks oral care related, maybe that's shift Easter, but your growth investments, are they having their intended effect and could you still see some acceleration in that business in the second half here? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, we will see acceleration of that business in the second half. And it is a very strong business for us. And you're right, we have made investment now for quite some time and in fact in Q2 we peaked that investment moving forward. So we see a couple of things happening for us. The accelerated investment for growth is now in a way hitting the peak for us, and you will see some of the business is really picking up in the second part of the year. And we have some easier comparison as well. So you comment on oral care and, as you'll recall, all will recall, we had a very strong first quarter, almost 5% growth, second quarter was flat. And I think when you look upon that there is of course an impact, as we talked about billing days and selling days in West Europe due to Easter specifically. But I also think you saw in the United States end-user demand was down in the second quarter due to the reduction of restorative procedures. So I think, if you take those together, the growth for oral care after the first two quarter is 2%. So clearly, we are continuing to grow and we take market share. So I'm not overly concerned about that shift in between Q1 and Q2 for that business. And Health Care will do very well as we move ahead into the second part of the year. So we're on plan and it look good for us. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Inge. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. I'd like to pick up on the price theme just for a second. I think you have to go back to 2008 to see net price negative. And I guess I'm curious to know, are you guys \u2013 are you cutting price because your products are too expensive? Or because competitors have cut price? Or the underlying markets are changing out from under you? Maybe a little more color as to what's the context and nature of these adjustments? And in theory price cuts just don't happen on a one-time basis, there's a certain degree of perpetualness to it, right? Maybe you could help frame the durational context in your minds. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, John, you know as well as I do, it's a competitive world. We're constantly working to, how can we gain the market share that we think our products should be having? In this kind of competitive world, we keep looking for \u2013 where are there opportunities where price could have been a barrier for us taking market share? And in a couple of businesses I mentioned, Industrial and Consumer as well as Electronics in Asia, we look for where there are those opportunities. Partly how I think about this, John, we're also through our investments to accelerate growth as we're investing more dollars to commercialize many of our existing product lines. In some of those cases we looked at where are there opportunities where price \u2013 our current price position could be a barrier to us reaching the maximum market share potential that we felt we could attain. And we're making those selected adjustments. I do think we are at probably the peak of the price declines that we've taken to do that. I don't see much further downward pressure from the momentum we've had. And if anything, I see the second half of the year with some uptick in that pricing. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So if I read between what you're saying, it sounds like you're saying that as you're looking at sort of strategy in the future, you said, hey, certain product lines in these categories are going to face upward limits if we don't actually adjust prices lower. So in other words, competitors weren't putting pressure on you, although maybe that happened thoughtfully (34:22), but this is very much 3M driving the strategic pricing, is that fair? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, John, I think the fair way to characterize it is, these are 3M decisions we're making not responses we're making in the market. These are 3M driven actions. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And then next, just the decline in share repurchase for the year kind of at the midpoint, what exactly are you signaling if anything? And maybe you could remind us what exactly is your dividend policy? Your stock's done incredibly well, but now your yield is kind of \u2013 it's bordering on below-average. I mean, is it a payout formula? Or is it a yield function? Or maybe you could just remind us again please. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: I'll talk broadly on returning cash to shareholders and then go into specifically what you're asking on the dividend, and the share repurchases. So you know for us, John, returning cash to shareholders is a priority and we do it both through dividends and we do it through share repurchases. On the dividend front, we've reached a point where we think our dividend payout ratio is in the zone that we want it to be, and future increases in our dividend over time, we expect to be very similar to what we anticipate for earnings per share growth. So in the coming years, we expect our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. On the share repurchase front, that's more dynamic for us, and you've probably heard me say this before, we have a two-fold strategy there. We do maintain a consistent presence in the market with a base level of repurchases, and then we augment that with opportunistic buyback based on relative value. We continually assess the market valuation through our own analysis, comparing it to how the stock is trading, and over time, we've found that to be a good risk-adjusted basis to be creating value. Now, in the case of lower purchases, both for the quarter and for the year, we adjusted the full-year range down based on where we stand through the first half of the year. The market has been strong and we're exercising discipline. And we anticipate that there will continue to be opportunities in the future to effectively deploy capital to maximize those returns. I would also add that our allocation of capital to share buyback is also influenced by other demands on capital such as M&A. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So in other words, Nick, is the money you're going to save from share repo this year, is that sort of earmarked for something else? Or is it kind of a wait and see then? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: There's a bit of a wait and see on that, John, that we still plan to be putting significant capital into share repurchases. We have announced our planned acquisition of Scott Safety, which we anticipate to happen in the second half of the year. But as you know, this type of market, there can be dynamics, so we are keeping our options open for the second half of the year. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes, we'd like to have flexibility, John, as we move ahead. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, makes sense. Thank you very much. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the strategic investments, you have spoken a lot about it on the call and it's been consistent with kind of your contemplation through the first half of the year. Could you talk about specifically what kind of returns you're looking for on these investments, whether paybacks or ROI? And talk about are the nature of the investments truly growth investments or there's some restructuring involved as well in certain areas where perhaps demand is not what you're thinking it is? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Rob, you can think of our growth investments this year in two big components. One is our investments in growth, and that's the minority part of the investment and it's aligned with what we originally guided back in December about an incremental $100 million that we anticipate to be spending in growth investments. There's a number of core product platforms we have that we're investing in commercialization dollars in some cases that can be advertising, merchandising, in some cases it can be people involved in adding people in the actual selling process of our products. And we anticipate that that will add 50 basis points to 100 basis points to our growth for the total year, and that's factored into our guidance now. And through the first half of the year, Rob, we're seeing our growth and our expenditures on that front tracking very much in line. But that's the minority of our total strategic investments. The more significant thing on strategic investments for us in 2017 is the actions we're taking in optimizing our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And that aligns with what we shared in March of 2016 when we laid out our five-year plan. And in optimizing our footprint and our manufacturing base, we anticipated over a period of the next few years we'd be investing between $500 million and $600 million, in some cases closing manufacturing sites and shifting manufacturing and expanding manufacturing in our more efficient sites, ultimately to reduce our total manufacturing footprint, to improve efficiency and to improve our ability to service our customers. Most of what you're seeing under strategic investments fits under that strategy. We took a number of actions in the second quarter, and in terms of the return, the way we've quantified that there's a couple ways I can quantify that for you, Rob. One is, by 2020 we anticipate that this will increase our operating income annually between $125 million and $175 million. That's one way for you to think of it. Another way is that we anticipate that this will be greater than a 30% return on investment for the investment that we're taking on this footprint optimization. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very thorough. Thank you. I mean, I guess the other question in the context of some of these pricing discussions that John and Andy alluded to, you'll find that investors in the space generally have a lot of PTSD when it comes to Amazon with respect to the distribution disruption that's going on across the board, and we see price concessions or a pricing regime of sorts in consumer, industrial businesses. Can you talk about your \u2013 are you rethinking distribution and the sensitivity to price or going direct? Or anything along those lines that would kind of orient why you think this is a forward thinking 3M movement that you're kind of looking at things and saying maybe the business is changing, or maybe the environment is changing, we're going to get ahead of this and have more concessions on price or maybe do value engineering around new products to drive better growth. Could you just comment on that? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: This is Inge. Let us first of all talk about what is going on in the marketplace. And as you talked about initially, consumer if you like, what is going on in the retail and consumer space. When you lead a business in totality, it's not price that you initially think about, you think about structure. And if you take our Consumer business, in order to adjust our structure for the future we started that back in 2012. So 2012 was when we start to look upon our Consumer business in terms of how do we operate, and how do we think the future will look like, and how can we become more relevant to our customers? That was the question. At that time we had nine divisions in consumer, today we have four. So you think about that in terms of evolution of the portfolio. We started back very early to adjust for future that eventually could look different. And as you heard in the result today, there's slight difference in it in terms of consolidation for us as we have three or four business divisions growing. It's basically the office supply that still consolidation is going on. We have not seen any either in Consumer or in Industrial, any differences relative to the power for us to drive growth. We're often a price leader and we're executing those plans. So we don't see differences there. And if you think about 3M generally speaking as a business, 70% of our business is either design or specked in or regulated. So if you think about it from that perspective, it's a smaller portion of 3M that eventually could be impacted. And we will adjust relative to that. But we're not thinking of going on price because that's not our business model. Our business model is to introduce a product that is adding value either through different design or improved productivity, and then we're driving price based on that. But your question is on price, and I would say we are adjusting our business models as we move forward. And often that is for us the structure in commercialization and it's also footprint, right? So you saw the investment we are doing here and the first question relative to return on that $500 million to $600 million with an annual return by 2020 of in between $125 million to $175 million. Those are important things for us to improve our competitiveness as we move forward. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I hate to return to the same pricing, but I just don't think I've ever heard 3M trying to drive volumes or market share gains through price, so I'm wondering are you taking here a decision to invest some of the raw material goodness, the deflation in raw materials into price and hence market share? And just may be, Nick, thinks about that $0.10, $0.15 of raw material deflation benefit in the plan, how does that look on a net basis versus price at this point? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. For the raw materials, the $0.10 to $0.15 that we anticipated of benefits at the beginning of the year, there's been puts and takes as we go along on the raw material side, but so far we're still seeing ourselves in that range of $0.10 to $0.15. I'd say, the potential were, in the last couple of years were we could go past that number, I don't see that is a very high probability. I see this in this range, maybe $0.10 being a little towards the bottom end of that range based on what we're seeing in the raw material markets today. On the pricing front, I don't know what to repeat, but other than there have been these isolated places where we've taken action. In the second half of the year, we expect a more normal price growth for 3M as we've put in plan some actions to be bringing price back to a more normal level that we've historically experienced in 3M. So I don't see much changing on that front from our original guidance, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's fair. And just to clarify, when you say normal, do you mean the 30 bps to 50 bps ex-FX, will that be the second half of the year? Or is that more 2018? And then maybe just clarify as well the comment you made on the investment spending in 2018, you said $0.10. Now, is that $0.10 on top of the $0.05 to $0.10 run rate or $0.10 total? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: On the strategic investment around growth, when we started the year we said that we expected that to be an incremental $0.10 expense and we continue to expect it to be that incremental $0.10. We're not increasing that number any further. And then on the price growth, Well, I'd say it is a more normal range, I do think it'll still be to the lower end on price growth in the second half of the year, approaching in the positive zone, but not up to the whole 30 basis points to 50 basis points that we normally are getting for core price growth. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So when you think about the Industrial business and I guess you can kind of throw Safety and Graphics in there as well, how much of that business currently goes through kind of the proper industrial distributors? And then how has that kind of trended relative to online and the Amazons of the world over the last, call it, two years here, three years, in rough terms? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. This is Inge. If you think about \u2013 you combine the two businesses which is a good way to look upon it, I would say that think about it like a 50-50 model, if you think on it globally. Some countries will have more distribution than others. But if you think about the two businesses combined and how we go to market, I think it's 50-50 generally speaking. Again, if you take many businesses in both Industrial and in Safety and Graphics, they are spec in or designed in or also regulated in a way. So the push will maybe happen for some consumables that will go through e-business channels, if you like. But we have not seen a big trend in that space as of yet. Maybe it will come, but I think then you have to think about how will that impact you relative to what you do with your end customers. But we are prepared to move in that direction. And if you look upon our business in the second quarter, if you take the two businesses you're talking about, the increase relative to e-business was 9%, and they estimate it to be 14% for the second half of the way. But you have to think about it also, that piece today for us is 2% to 3% of our total business what we do e-business direct ourselves. Many, many of our customers are of course finding the platforms themselves but they will not impact us by definition as we see at this point in time on price levels. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So when we think about kind of what's going on in the world going back to Rob's question around the higher level strategic type of stuff, Grainger obviously came out and made some headlines talking about cutting price to drive growth. They have a great franchise historically. I mean, you guys obviously have one of the greatest franchises ever and you're talking about cutting price to drive growth. Is this just coincidence? Is this just kind of the macro environment that we're in? Or are these in some way linked to what's become a much more dynamic competitive environment in the Industrial or even Consumer channels if you want to throw Consumer in there as well. Any relationship there at all? Has Grainger at all called you and said, hey, let's take some of the pain because I know you guys go to them a bit. It's just \u2013 this deflationary environment is just something new for all of us, I think, over the last (51:44). Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: I cannot comment on Grainger, but of course in business, generally speaking, that would be more dynamic as you move ahead, right? I think we see that specifically in the retail area at this point in time. And then I think different company will have different impacts, right? If you think about what we're all about relative to our portfolio, as I said, a lot of it is spec in, design in and regulated. So by definition, to drive that in terms of price down, that's where you have to hold back to your technology platforms, to your brand equity, et cetera. So I don't see a direct correlation as you talk about this quarter to be honest. But I will agree to as we move ahead that in all businesses, in health care or electronics or consumer, industrial, dynamics will happen and we have to adjust to that and that's what we're doing by the way, right? When you see some of our investments in terms of strategic investment for the future is to make sure we are more competitive as we move ahead. And we take action on most things in terms of our infrastructure to make sure we drive out as much cost as we can, flatten the organization and make sure we have a more agile execution model as we move ahead. So you're prepared for whatever is coming at you, right. And as I always have said, when you take those actions, do it when you can not only must. So we are taking some of those \u2013 we do it now because we can and prepare ourselves for a much, much better, more competitive and more agile 3M as we move ahead. Will pricing be one part of those and be driven by the market? Well, let's see. But important thing that you have all your fundamentals in place so you can complete. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And, Nick, just very quickly, just in the second half, the comps get just a little bit tougher yet you're kind of into the high end of the range even though the first half growth is more at the midpoint of the new range. So should we just kind of ignore the comps and assume that things accelerate in the second half of the year despite that? Do you see the true economy getting better in the second half? It just would seem that your peak growth rate probably happened in the first quarter. Maybe I'm wrong about that from a timing perspective \u2013 or days sales or something. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, when it comes to the comps, there's a couple of different things going on. One, like for instance our Electronics and Industrial, both of those, I agree with you, we're going to have slightly tougher comps in the second half of the year. In the case of Consumer and in Health Care, both of those will be seeing easier comps. I wouldn't call it a big statement on our fact that we're seeing an improving economy. We're seeing a fairly stable economy outlook for the balance of the year. Our move in the organic growth range to now would be 3% to 5% and take us confidence in our ability to maintain the growth trajectory even with the tougher comp that we'll be facing, primarily in the fourth quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks for the detail. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just to start off in Consumer with the U.S. being down 1%, this is seasonally where we see a back-to-school impact in Consumer. How did that play out in the quarter? We've seen industry reports where spending has been higher year-over-year, and want to see how that rippled through for you guys? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So we're not through that, but I think the headline there is that this is the strongest we've seen in the past and maybe slightly stronger. I think, what you see is if you compare maybe the last couple of years versus five, six years ago, is that they wait longer to make the purchase today versus three, four, five years ago. So we will see more growth coming for that category specifically. If you look upon our performance for Consumer in United States, we can basically go right down to the office supply by definition. So there's nothing else going on there. And when you talk about back-to-school, it looks very solid for us. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good to hear. And then a follow-up question, Inge, there was some interesting announcements regarding succession planning at 3M this quarter, looks orderly, looks well signaled, especially compared to the past. Can you comment on these announcements? Maybe specifically on expectations regarding timing? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all the announcement was not about succession planning. The announcement was around we have a job to do. And if you saw the two announcements we did, we announced Mike Roman to take on the growth piece of the enterprise, right? So leading the five business group and the international piece. So that's around growth, and we need more growth, so that will be his focus. And then H.C. Shin was appointed Vice Chair, and he's taking on all the efficiencies, so everything going in relative to manufacturing and supply chain. And also R&D was put, and strategic planning was put under his plate. And as I said earlier, now succession planning started first day in office, right? So as a CEO you have to look upon it from the first day you walk into office. That's your obligation, and I have done that. And we have many very strong leaders in the company, Mike and H.C. are two of them, and they both have had tremendous successful record relative to leading businesses. H.C., the last six years led international, replaced me in that role before I became CEO. And before that, he in fact led the Industrial business group. Mike Roman has led the Industrial business group the last three years, before that was the Strategic Planner for the company, have lived both in Europe and Asia and have had good results. So we have two very solid individuals that have a job to do here. And so that's the whole point I would like to make with any comments around it. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Just a question on the EPS bridge. So in Q2 you had about $0.08 of tailwind from organic growth and productivity. In the first quarter that was about $0.22. And the price-volume dynamics, despite the questions so far, aren't grotesquely different in Q2 from Q1. So I wondered if there was something else going on that had weighed on the operating leverage in Q2? Maybe the timing of the business transformation or something like that? And how you thought about that $0.08 tailwind in Q2 in the context of what we should see in Q3 and Q4? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Julian, if I think about the different quarters, as you're talking about Q1, Q2, we did see core underlying margin expansion once we strip out the gains in the strategic investments in Q1. And in Q2, we're more or less flat. So that's mathematically much of what's describing what you're seeing there on that EPS differential between Q1 and Q2. As we dissect that a little deeper, Julian, where did we not see some of the margin expansion we had seen in the past, and what does that mean for the second half of the year? Our Industrial business is one of those businesses where we didn't see as much leverage as we have seen in the past. And as we look to the second half of the year, we're expecting for the total year that we're going to be seeing 50 basis points at a minimum, possibly higher, of year-on-year margin expansion, stripping out the gain and strategic investment impact, so if we get to the underlying 50 basis points or slightly higher. Some of the reasons that will drive added leverage in a business such as Industrial, we do see that improved pricing that I talked about earlier. We do see improved results from our productivity programs, and probably some added belt-tightening going on. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then just my second and last question would be around the growth outlook in the EMEA region. I think a lot of companies this earnings have talked about a disconnect of the good soft data not necessarily translating into hard orders or sales. Should we think about your first half overall organic growth in the region of 1%? That is a good placeholder of what you expect for the second half? And maybe just any update on how you're seeing business in Europe in recent months? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. I think, when we look upon the rest of the year, I think you can see slightly more growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. So we look maybe for 2% in the second part of the year. I would say the comment relative to West Europe specifically is more around, I think Germany is still doing well. And if you look upon our figures and the way we do business over there, if you take manufacturing PMI in Germany, the second quarter was 59%, if you compare that to like 50% and 51%, 52% for China. So Germany, by definition, which is the big engine in Europe are doing well on the manufacturing side. And our business in Europe, if you look upon the portfolio, our Industrial business is very strong. So from that perspective, it's okay if you look ahead. We have not seen much of an impact to us relative to Brexit. I think countries like Spain are improving, but very much based on a lower base and some trouble they've had in the past. So when I look upon it, I would say Germany is doing well, which is a key element for you to be successful in Europe, and Nordic is doing fine, and you start to see some uptick maybe from countries like Spain. France goes sideways as we speak, but with the outcome of the election, I think that will be more positive if they can execute what they have promised, and why not? So, I think, as an outcome for Europe, generally speaking, is more positive than negative in my view. Relative to 3M, we have been on this optimization of the organization for quite some time, and if you joined, or for those of you that joined in Neuss, Germany here, a little more than a month ago, our whole execution of the EPS and SAP system is going very, very well. And I was \u2013 last week, I visited both center of expertise that we have. We have one service center in Poland and we have one supply chain center in Switzerland. I visited both of them and things are going very, very well for us in that execution. So for me, Europe generally speaking, externally, look more positive than negative. And I'm not talking only here the next two quarters. I'm talking a little bit further out, and our structure in place in Europe start to really gain momentum and deliver for us. This quarter was a little bit tough on top line but, generally speaking, I'm pleased with the progress we have made and that will pay off as we move ahead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Joe. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, Nick, I want to kind of circle back to some of the comments you made earlier on the strategic investments, and just doing some of the back of the envelope math here, it seems like you're going to put forth about $400 million towards strategic investments this year, call it roughly $100 next year, and then we'll see in 2019. And then the payback in 2020 on an annualized basis is $125 million to $175 million. I'm just wondering like what is it about the investments that you're making? It just seems like it's taking a while for the payback to actually be seen in your margins. And so maybe if you can just provide some color on that? That would be helpful. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Joe, thanks for asking that question. There's different types of actions a company like us, like 3M can take. Sometimes an action where we enter into a restructuring where we're reducing the size of our workforce, that can be a much faster payback. And you've seen actions like that that we've done and see very fast payback. When it comes to optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, those paybacks take time to materialize. We don't start seeing benefits, Joe, until we actually have the manufacturing site closed that we've chosen to action, and have the new manufacturing going on in a new location. That takes time to happen. It takes time to work with work councils, with employee organizations, it takes time to, in some places re-qualify that product if we're moving. It can many times be several quarters before we \u2013 from the point we announce it until we've actually physically made the change and start realizing those benefits. So this is different, and this is why this one takes longer to get happen. Still a very important part of our strategy though to be by 2020 getting to those savings that we're projecting. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Nick, that's helpful color. I guess, just a clarifying question on that, so this year you have gains that are essentially offsetting all of the investments that you're making. Next year there's going to be additional investments that you're making. Is the right way to think about 2018 that there's going to be a net negative to your margin from these investments? Or are there going to be other offsetting items as well in 2018? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Well, I can't speculate on whether there will be more M&A activity that will happen because those we announce once we have clear line of sight that they'll actually happen. But in terms of the footprint side, we'll still be seeing the negative impact in absolute terms in 2018 on our margin and on our EPS. We expect in 2019 to become positive, and then by 2020 to be the full amount. As far as the M&A and what that might do in 2018, I think it's too early for me to speculate on that piece. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just talking about the growth investments that you're making, and just to make sure that I understand that well, so you mentioned about $100 million in growth investments this year. And so if I just kind of think about just the payback from those investments, you mentioned it was about a point of growth, so call it like $300 million or so in revenue, at your operating margin 25%, say, if you're talking about, call it, roughly $75 million in profit. The question, I guess, is regarding these growth investments, do you think that going forward this is going to be part of the status quo or you're going to have to continue to make these investments? Or are these investments going to drive like a longer cycle product growth across your portfolio? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, it's $104 million additional investment for commercialization this year. And we said it will drive 50 basis point to 100 basis point of growth. And six, seven months into the year, we see that coming exactly as we laid out. I think, it's important to think about it. This is products and categories where we already have a very good position in the marketplace. So this is more, sell more of the same, but penetrate different parts of the world. So this is not relative to total new products or anything, this is category of products into markets where we already have a very good return and a good position in some parts of the world, but not everywhere. So we selected those programs in August of last year in order to make those investments. So with success, I think they will get more investment as they go, but it will be part of the normal business model. So this was an acceleration for us and an additional push. And I would say pretty safe product lines for us to penetrate more and broader, and deeper around the world. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Inge. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Just a quick one. You flagged certain markets where in organic local currency terms you've been in decline on filtration, roofing granules, office supplies, European health care, European energy, European consumer. If you look at that cluster of businesses, I think I might have missed one or two, if you look at that cluster of businesses, do you see a line of sight to getting that cluster back to a growth track next year? Or do you need a change in the macro environment to get there? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, I think, generally speaking, you will have from time to time some businesses that are not growing as fast as the rest of them. I think, the important thing for us is to make sure that all businesses can capitalize and use our four fundamental strengths in order to be strong. So the four fundamental strengths we have talked about is our technology platforms, our manufacturing capabilities, our geographic reach, and our brand equity. If you follow those categories, you will grow over time, and you will perform very, very well. And there's none of the businesses you listed there that I would say will fall out of that frame specifically. So I'm not overly concerned relative to any of them that you talked about specifically. And I would say, all of us leading businesses, we would like all businesses to grow every quarter, the whole time, right? But that is not reality. So I would say, our competitive position based on the four fundamentals of the company is very strong, and we should be able to outperform the local market wherever we compete. And as you know, we have talked about 1.5 times IPI, industrial production index, as a target that we have done in the past. And I think we should do closer to 1.7. So I'm optimistic relative to the future. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : If I could just summarize \u2013 it's been a bit of a frustrating call \u2013 but just to summarize, your predecessor focused on driving top line, and there was this view that top line comes at the expense of margin that if you get growth you're not going to get margin. And this quarter I think seems to bring back those fears. On top of that of course you have the Amazon fear. If you look forward, do you think your new strategy for expanding some key products means that margin is now capped for a while as we're pursuing this growth strategy? Or do you think 3M still has levers to drive margin up both near-term and long-term? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Andrew, no fear. Don't be overly concerned relative to that strategy. And I think you have to think about it in a way that a certain element at a certain time you need to do with the business. And I think what we have done, we have worked very hard on the portfolio in order to make sure that we stay in businesses where we can use our four fundamental strengths. And if there's some businesses that have been underperforming, in every single case have been \u2013 the reason have been that they have not been able to use the four fundamental strengths. I think that's the basis for it. We have also said that by shifting and moving in the portfolio, our performance will be much better over time. And I think we have proven that in Electronics and Energy. I think we have proven that in Safety and Graphics. I think we have proven that in Consumer, if I go back to the 2012 starting point. And in Health Care we didn't need to do much because that portfolio was very strong by definition with high margins. Now we are focusing more in on the Industrial, and we are taking action there. And one \u2013 that's one-third of the company, so we need to get Industrial up and growing at a faster rate. And we have now had three good quarters of growth as we speak. And we are now taking action and more focus as we move forward relative to productivity, organizational structure, et cetera. So for me, it's not a question of one quarter, it's a question of how will it look as we go forward. I'm totally confident with all the work we have done, the way we have worked on the portfolio, the way we are improving the way we go to market, that we will continue to lever very well and deliver good result as we move forward. If not, I wouldn't execute the plan at all. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. That's a great answer. And just a question in terms of what would it take to get high-end of your guidance on top line in terms of key regions and businesses, if you could outline the bull case scenario? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, we upgraded the range from 3% to 5%, as you saw, right? And I think to be in the middle of that is very doable. We have 4% growth in the first part of the year. I think, we're not talking about businesses, but I would say from a geographical perspective, if we can capitalize more on our strengths in the United States, even more on that will help us. And I think the same for West Europe. So I think, it's \u2013 the United States, where we are \u2013 we are doing fine, but I think we are so strong here that we should be able to take even more of the opportunities in the United States. And as I said earlier, West Europe looks slightly better in my mind than I thought maybe two, three quarters ago. Let's see if that can come through during the rest of the year. If that's happened, then maybe can push us up to the higher end. But let's see? So let's hold for the \u2013 let's hold the range for 3% to 5% for now, and then we can talk next quarter to see how it look like if we can give you some more color to it. But 3% to 5% is very, very realistic for us. And as I said earlier, I'm very pleased with where we are after two quarters in terms of the result. 4% growth after two quarter is respectable for us I think and pretty good. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to reiterate, because I am getting these e-mails, you outlined a margin growth strategy in Europe, you're sort of positive on margin opportunity in Safety and Graphics. None of that has changed? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No. Nothing of that has changed. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: No, nothing has changed on that front. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: No, no, no. Not at all. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Absolutely not. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Not at all. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. As I said earlier, I'm pleased with the performance through the first six months of the year. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook and positioned to deliver a strong 2017. As you saw today in our updated guidance, this includes good progress relative to our four primary financial objectives : earnings per share, organic local currency sales growth, return on invested capital, and free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we are making investments to accelerate growth and strengthen our portfolio, which will build on an even more competitive 3M for 2018 and beyond. Thank you very much for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 25. And second, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place in New York City on December 12 from 8 a.m. to noon. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there. Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 4. And I'll hand the call off to Inge. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Coming off a strong first half, our team delivered an even more robust performance in the third quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 7% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and record earnings and did so while continuing to invest for the future. Let me take you through the highlights. Total sales were $8.2 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise. As I mentioned, we delivered strong broad-based organic growth of 7% led by Electronics & Energy at 13%. Health Care grew 7% organically, followed by 6% growth for both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Consumer business posted organic growth of 2%, its second consecutive quarter of positive growth. It was also good to see broad-based growth across all geographic areas. This was true in both developed and developing markets, where our long-standing presence, market position, and depth of capabilities enable us to win. Growth in developed market was 4% with 14% growth in developing markets. With respect to EPS, we increased earnings more than 8% to $2.33 per share, which is a Q3 record. Company-wide we expanded margins to 25% with all business groups above 22%. Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 100%. We continue to invest and grow the business while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter we returned $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to slide 5. Beyond financial results, we are continuing to build an enterprise that is positioned for success both today and into the future. This includes executing our three key levers, which are significant value creators. The first is portfolio management. And earlier this month we finalized our acquisition of Scott Safety. This will complement organic growth and further enhance our position in the fast-growing global personal safety market. At the same time, we completed the sales of the electronic monitoring business, which no longer aligned with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management, a process we have intensified over the last several years, is strengthening our competitiveness and making us more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. Investing in innovation is the second lever. Research and development is the heartbeat of 3M. It's how we deliver premium value to our customers and premium returns to our shareholders. This is why we continue to invest 6% of sales into research and development, which total $463 million in the quarter. The third lever is business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. The deployment of our ERP system remains on track with West Europe nearly complete. We have also started initial deployments in the United States, which you will hear more about at our outlook meeting on December 12. That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance. We posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 6.6%, as we continue to outgrow the markets we serve. Selling prices improved sequentially versus second quarter and were flat year on year. Excluding Electronics, price was up 20 basis points, which marks our strongest quarterly pricing performance this year. The divestiture of nonstrategic businesses over the last 12 months reduced sales in the quarter by 120 basis points. Conversely, foreign currency translation increased sales by 60 basis points. All-in, third quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 3.6%, led by a high single digit increase in Health Care and a mid-single-digit increase in Industrial. Our Safety & Graphics and Consumer businesses also delivered positive growth in the quarter. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 13% in Q3. All business groups within Asia-Pacific continued to post strong growth in the quarter, including double digit increases in our Electronics & Energy business and in our Safety & Graphics business. Organic growth was 23% in China/Hong Kong and 5% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong grew in the mid-teens and Japan was up 3%. Moving to EMEA, organic growth was 4% in Q3 with West Europe up 3%. Both the Safety & Graphics and Industrial businesses led the growth in EMEA. Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 5%. All businesses posted positive growth with Health Care leading the way, up high single digits. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 14%. Mexico was up 5%, while Brazil was flat. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in raising our full year expectations, which Inge will discuss later. Please turn to slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with net income of $1.4 billion, up 7.5%. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margins were 25%, which includes a 60 basis point impact from incremental strategic investments. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the third quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 90 basis points to operating margins. Our continued focus on portfolio management is strengthening our enterprise in many ways, including margins, which improved by 40 basis points due to the exit of nonstrategic businesses. The combination of lower raw material costs and selling price changes added another 30 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. And higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share, up 8.4% year over year. This result includes a $0.06 impact from incremental strategic investments. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.23 per share to Q3 earnings. Organic growth was the predominant driver along with raw material benefits and the continued positive impact business transformation is having on our productivity efforts. Acquisitions and divestitures added a penny to earnings year over year. Foreign currency net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.03 a share. And the slightly lower tax rate was a $0.01 benefit. Finally, lower shares outstanding net of higher interest expense was a $0.02 benefit to EPS. Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 100%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 100%. Turning to CapEx, we continue to be encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in both growth and disruptive technologies. Third quarter capital expenditures were $325 million. And we expect these investments to be approximately $1.4 billion for the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $701 million in dividends, up $31 million. We also returned $380 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases, or $1.6 billion year to date. We now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion to $3.5 billion previously. Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth, up 6.1% organically in the third quarter. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and all businesses. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial \u2013 namely industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket \u2013 all delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. Our auto OEM business was up 6%, outpacing global car and light truck builds by approximately 400 basis points, as we continue to drive increased penetration on the automotive OEM platforms across the globe. Finally, advanced materials led the way with mid-teens growth in the quarter with strong performance across its portfolio, while also benefiting from favorable year-on-year comps. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while all other areas grew mid-single digits. Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $614 million with an operating margin of 22.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 22.6%, a 110 basis point improvement from Q2 levels. Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter Safety & Graphics sales grew 6% organically. Growth was led by our personal safety business, which accelerated to double digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions and look to build on this strength with the integration of Scott Safety starting here in the fourth quarter. Our roofing granules business grew solidly, up mid-single digits on top of a tough year-on-year comp. Lastly, transportation safety posted positive organic growth in Q3, as we continue to evolve its portfolio with the sale of the electronic monitoring business earlier this month. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas, led by an 11% increase in Asia-Pacific and an 8% increase in EMEA. Third quarter profits in Safety & Graphics were up 11% year on year to $410 million with operating margins of nearly 27%. Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business in the third quarter grew 6.9% organically. Health Care delivered broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies. Our medical consumables business, which is our largest segment within Health Care, posted high single digit growth, as worldwide demand for 3M's products and solutions remains strong. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, as we continued to deliver strong international growth, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and West Europe. Organic growth in Health Care was led by a double digit increase in our drug delivery business. Geographically, organic growth was led by high single digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America/Canada, and the U.S. We saw notable strength in Health Care across developing markets, particularly in China/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $471 million and operating margins were 31.9%. Please turn to slide 13. Electronics & Energy third quarter organic sales growth was up 13% and is up 11% year to date. We are on track to deliver 10% organic growth for the year. This business continues to benefit from our portfolio management efforts over the past few years to streamline the business, enhance customer relevance, and drive improved efficiencies. The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally, including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, data centers, and automotive electrification. Our Energy related businesses were up 2% organically with electrical markets up mid-single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 20% increase in Asia-Pacific, while Latin America/Canada and EMEA also delivered positive growth. Third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $394 million with operating margins of 27.9%. Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer grew organically 1.9%, which was a continued improvement versus recent quarters. We saw positive organic growth in three of our four Consumer businesses, namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care, while stationery and office declined. Category defining brands in Consumer continue to be a strength for 3M. We delivered strong double digit growth in both Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painters tape. Filtrete home filtration products grew mid-single digits globally. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while Latin America/Canada and the U.S. also delivered positive growth. Finally, operating income was $307 million with an operating margin of 24.8%. Adjusting for strategic investments year on year, operating margins were nearly 26%. Please turn to slide 15. Before turning the call back over to Inge, I want to cover a few items that will impact the fourth quarter. First, the completed divestiture of the electronic monitoring business is expected to have a net positive impact of $0.12 to earnings in Q4. Second, the Scott Safety income, net of acquisition and integration costs, is expected to reduce earnings per share by $0.08. Third, we recently closed a debt tender offer to retire some of our higher coupon debt. This will result in a nonoperating charge estimated to be an $0.11 impact to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Lastly, as we have discussed throughout the year, we plan to continue to take actions in Q4 to strengthen our portfolio and better optimize our footprint. We estimate that these incremental investments will negatively impact fourth quarter per share earnings by approximately $0.06 to $0.10. Please turn to slide 16. And I will now turn the call back over to Inge. Inge? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and throughout the year. As a result, today we are increasing our expectation for 2017 in terms of both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth of 4% to 5% versus a prior range of 3% to 5%. With respect to EPS, we expect earnings of $9 to $9.10 per share, versus a prior range of $8.80 to $9.05. This is a 10% to 12% increase year on year. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. With that I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Please limit your participation to one question and one follow up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Andrew. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question, sort of a top-down question. Top-line growth 6.6%. As you think, this economic environment, right, and as you overlay it over your longer term framework, would you describe current economic environment as average relative to your five-year framework? Above average? And from that perspective, I'm just trying to think, if 6.6% is something we can expect to achieve in this environment? Or is that a one off? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, first of all, good morning. I think to talk about the five-year plan is maybe difficult, and that's the frame you put it into. But I will say that it's maybe on the high end versus what we thought when we lay out the plan originally as we stand. You can also see that we have a range now that we move from. We've gone from 2% to 5%, then 3% to 5%. Now we are 4% to 5% for the year. And we have very high confidence as we move into 2018, which we will talk more about on December 12 in New York. But I will say that generally speaking, the execution of our commercialization programs are going very well for us. And it's broad-based, which is very, very good. So I think it's \u2013 I think about 4% to 5% for the remainder of this year. I would think more about on the high end of the 4% to 5%. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Terrific. And just a follow-up question. On the Electronics growth, that has been very good. Can you just give us a little bit more color what specifically drives it? And I'm just trying to understand how much of it, sort of increased content in mobile devices, particularly on adhesives. Or your participation in the Asian semiconductor cycle, if you could separate those two sources of growth. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. Well, first of all, I think always on Electronics & Energy as a business group, we have, yes, to take a step back and really understand what we have done from a portfolio perspective. And that is something that we all see as we take actions. What is not so visible if you're not right in the industry day by day is also how we have shifted and accelerated some investment to faster growing segments. So I think that's an important element for us to think about. Now on the platform for consumer electronics, we are very global. So for us, we are adding penetration on a global base in most of those devices. And it's going very fast. I will say specifically on the China OEM in terms of the pickup. And if you think about that, demand there for performance, quality, and functionality is exactly what we are all about. So that means that we are growing very fast on those platforms. So we are doing better there than we had estimated, which is a positive things. I think also in terms of growth, semiconductor, of course, we are part of that growth. And I will also say the shift in terms of us focusing more now versus three years ago on data centers, on automotive electrification, on energy grids is driving this growth. So if you think about it, just to give you facts, the base where we came from was a market that had a size of $60 billion, that had a growth of 1% to 3%. We're continuing there. But we have shifted during the last couple of years to market size that are $12 billion but have a growth rate to 10% to 15%. So I think that is the answer to what we are doing there. And I would say there the fact that the growth is coming, the margin are expanding, we are more relevant to our customer, is a big credit to that business group of what they have been doing. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But that would imply that Electronics growth is sustainable into 2018 as well, because these are structural drivers. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, I think so. It is. It is. But again, when you have technology conversion, you can have ups and downs in between quarters. But if you look upon the total business, we will continue to do well. Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning, Julian. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Julian. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Maybe just a first question around strategic investments. I think previously you talked about that being a step-up year on year of $0.20, $0.25 in the second half. Now it's looking somewhat less than that based on your guidance. Maybe just give some background as to why that's happening. Is it just a pushout into 2018? And what kind of returns? How are returns on that investment to date coming through? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Julian, thanks for that question. I would call what we're doing in the third quarter as a really good example of our business model in action, where we have good organic growth, strong margins. And at the same time we're taking actions to position 3M for future success. As you mentioned, earlier this year we announced we expected to incur between $0.60 and $0.65 of strategic investments for the full year. And we're tracking right in that range. And those strategic investments include things we talked about at the beginning of the year for core growth platforms, but also actions to be improving our footprint and addressing our portfolio. All of that part of the 4% to 5% organic growth outlook we now are seeing for this year. We are making good progress on that in 2017 to better optimize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And I'd point you back, Julian, to what we laid out when we \u2013 in March of 2016, about a plan to be investing between $500 million and $600 million over the course of a few years to ultimately generate $125 million to $175 million in annual benefits by 2020. So for the full year 2017, that $0.60 to $0.65 range does include the charge related to the debt tender that we'll be incurring in the fourth quarter. That has been part of our thinking. And we closed that tender in October, hence that charge coming in Q4. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then just my second question, price and raw materials in your operating margin bridge slightly picked up, a slightly larger tailwind in Q3 than in Q2. Within that, how much was the sort of raw materials portion? And do you view your current pricing trends as sustainable from here? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Most of that 30 basis points, Julian, is coming from raw materials. The pricing, as I mentioned for the total company, flat, or if I exclude Electronics, up 20 basis points. We're seeing that core underlying price growth growing as the year goes on, excluding the Electronics. So we're seeing Q3 as a quarter where our price strengthened. But the majority of that 30 basis points is coming from raw materials. And let me just elaborate a little more on that, Julian. The core underlying market we're facing for raw materials is certainly toughening. We are not seeing the underlying market creating that 30 basis points of benefit. That 30 basis points of benefit that we see hitting our financials is the result of work and projects that we're doing to take out raw material costs and the prices we're paying. So example, raw material substitutions or product reformulations to take out those raw material costs. That's the biggest thing driving that 30 basis points you're seeing. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Steve. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Really, really good quarter. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just following up on the Electronics commentary. You guided to kind of 10% for the year. I guess that implies, just making sure I get my math right here, that implies kind of 4Q at up high singles, kind of 7% to 8%. Is that correct from an organic perspective? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yes, Steve. Your math's pretty sound there. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess you talked about it as sustainable. I mean you're not saying that the double digit is sustainable obviously. I mean, semiconductor sales this year are up pretty solidly double digits. So it's not quite a surprise you guys are kind of doing well there. So when you say it's sustainable, do you mean relative to kind of an index of the devices you're on? Or within the range that you talked about? Kind of the trend line rate of that business over the last several years, it's just been more like mid-single digits? What did you kind of mean by sustainable? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: So, Steve, when we say sustainable for Electronics & Energy and the opportunities that we see there, we continue to see opportunities for penetration in consumer electronics. As Inge mentioned earlier, we continue to evolve our technologies to grow our relevance in consumer electronics. But even more importantly, we're repositioning our portfolio to be going after faster growing market opportunities in Electronics & Energy. And those are places where we're seeing the results of our actions paying off, where we're seeing growth occurring there. Places like automobile electrification. So Inge said a few minutes ago, we'll always see some ups and downs based on what's happening with underlying consumer demand for electronics. But the \u2013 what you're seeing now is our business model really working, of us going after the higher growth markets. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one more question just on kind of the investments and margins and how that's playing through. R&D was a little bit light. And anything going on there? I guess you're just kind of repurposing investments to more kind of commercial type of things? Is that how we should think about it? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, there's nothing going on. As you know, we have made a commitment to increase investment in research and development from 5.5% historically, closer to 6%. We are normally just running at 6%, so it's nothing abnormal going on there. But it's not the move to commercialization from those activities. We are very committed to research and development. And for us, science, technology, and sustainability is key driver for us as we move forward and as have been in the past. So there is no shift from R&D to commercialization. Commercialization, that's where we invested those additional $104 million for the year, when we expected 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. And as you see, it's coming. So we're very pleased with that. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Yeah. Great quarter. Congratulations. Thanks. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you, Steve. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Andrew. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You had an easier growth comparison in Health Care, but the acceleration in growth really is notable. I know you've been saying that you expect second half acceleration. But can you talk about whether this is simply your previous growth spending now really impacting the business? Or did you see an acceleration in Health Care markets? And can you talk about the sustainability of mid-single digit growth in this business moving forward? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yes. First of all, we have invested for quite some time in Health Care. And I think for Health Care specifically was the first business where we made additional investment that we broad based called core search. And that's paying off. And a lot of those investment was of course in developing economies. And we can see broad based that that's paying off. And we had \u2013 in the developing economy for the quarter, Health Care grew 12%, but they also grew in developed 6%. So our base is very strong in developed, specifically in United States and in West Europe. And we continue to grow very, very well there. And then you can see that the developing economy is coming as we planned. So I will say when we have talked about the range of 4% to 6%, that's a realistic plan. And then we will be in that range as we move forward. I have no doubt about that. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And then... Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Andrew, excuse me. I'll just add one thing. For the year, we're guiding Health Care 3% to 5%. And with the results we're about 4% growth through the first nine months of the year. We see ourselves solidly in the 3% to 5% range for 2017. Now and of course in the longer term, as Inge was just mentioning, the 4% to 6% is how we see growth in that business. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that, Nick. And then my follow-up is just on pricing again. You talked about U.S. pricing getting back closer to flat for the year, Nick, last quarter, which it does appear to be doing. But how much of the better pricing performance in the U.S. was 3M pulling back on rebating or discounting, versus just stronger overall Industrial and Consumer markets helping you? And do you think it's possible to get back to positive pricing in the U.S. in 2018? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Andrew, we have been seeing slight incremental improvements in pricing in the U.S. And we continue to see that improving into the future. I wouldn't call it any kind of pullback on our part that's causing that to happen. It's in \u2013 it's a pricing environment where we see our business model, one where we have increased ability for price growth there. As far as 2018, I'm not ready to declare an up or down on that one. We'll talk more about that on December 12. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Nice quarter. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. I will echo the xylophone of a solid, strong quarter. In any event \u2013 and I want to follow up on the pricing question as well. I mean obviously, you've been fairly contrite about perhaps not getting as much price as you wanted to get in the back half \u2013 or excuse me, the beginning part of the year. And you talked about catching up on that. And you've cited the 20 basis points. But could you talk maybe a little bit just structurally how you're thinking about your businesses? Where you think you're going to see pricing pressure over the next two years to three years? Obviously, the debate around kind of what is much more perceived as lending itself to transparency around Consumer, Industrial. And then kind of the rubber is meeting the road in Safety. But could you talk about where your moats are? And how you're feeling about it? Just maybe not in the context of what is a very strong kind of third quarter, fourth quarter right now, but just structurally down the road. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, you should think about 3M as the price leader in most, if not all, categories we are in. And if you look \u2013 if you think about that historically and as we move ahead, it's very much based on our scientifically based business model. So for us, if you think about the new products, the new solution that we are providing, it's all in order to drive improved productivity and/or efficiency for our customers. Our business model is about understanding our customers' business model. We are by definition not a commoditized company. So we don't go in and fight on businesses where price is the primary discussion. We try to go in and make things different versus just making them better. So you do things better. But where the real value is when you do it different. That's also the time when you can drive price. So there is \u2013 and as you can see, our commitment to science, technology, and sustainability is continuing that wave forward. And you have also seen the portfolio work we have done here the last three years, four years, five years have been businesses that are more commoditized. We don't think that we can add as much value to them versus other companies. That's also why they have exited our portfolio. So I would say that there will be no change moving forward relative to our strategy around pricing. Now again, as you know and we know, things in between quarters can change slightly. But there is no big change relative to our strategy around pricing. It's very, very important for us. And it's important due to the fact it's part of our business model. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Could \u2013 as a follow up maybe you could just talk about obviously the messaging for kind of your growth initiatives and continued commercialization. I suppose your outlook meeting will be around electrification. But could you talk about and maybe take it from the top for the portfolio where you see the most opportunities? And how we should be thinking about kind of quantifying what the longer term opportunity around electrification is? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Are you talking electrification, specifically? Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, for autos. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, of course. If you think about that in terms of the mega trends and what we can do, we have three elements into that area specifically. We are very strong in automotive. We have showed that over time. We are outperforming automotive build quarter after quarter and year after year and within this quarter as well. So our connection into automotive is very strong. We have a strong technology platform in our Electronic & Energy that we then utilize through those contacts in order to build our platforms. And then the other thing that is easy to forget is that we are a global leader in traffic safety. And if you take those elements together, traffic safety, automotive electrification, and pull them together, that's exactly where the trends are going. And there is big platform for us to capitalize as we move ahead. So think about it in that perspective of I will say a certain thing that will \u2013 you and I will see today as we drive our cars. But also things that would come relative to the evolution of road safety in the automotive space. Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Scott. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Scott. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Scott. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Welcome back. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Thank you. It's nice to be back. Appreciate it. Inge, you finally seemed to crack the code on China. That was a region that was tough for you guys for a while. And boy, you've had a couple pretty good years there. I mean what do you attribute most of the success? I mean I know you mentioned some of this earlier in the call. But have you changed up your sales and marketing? Does it just take time to get brand awareness? And is it pricing strategy? I mean what outside of Electronics, obviously. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : But if you could just talk through that. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: So first of all, we've been in China for a long time as you know. I think we started our wholly owned subsidiary there in 1984 and have made investment over time. And we have good capabilities in terms of manufacturing there. And we have also a good research and development center there. Now it looked like \u2013 and as we had talked about before, that being there is not a shift. But there have been additional investment in China for what we would call domestic markets. So that will for us then benefit Health Care and Consumer specifically. And I think what is happening as we speak is that the consumers in there and the OEMs, they're becoming more demanding on performance, on quality, and functionality and brands. And that is going right into our business model in order for us to be more relevant. So we are capitalizing on that. We have also made additional investment in the domestic markets. Right? So you think about it in terms of everything that is produced and commercialized there. And we grow two times GDP and IPI (43:54) in the last couple of quarters. And we have shifted a portfolio to more Safety also in Health Care. So that's helping us in addition our own initiative. So that's type of, I would say, Chinese mega trends if you like. And then we, in addition, have made a lot of efforts on air quality, water quality, and automotive electrification. So you take that together, growth are coming. And it's very nice to see. So I think it's a focus, a presence and a focus, a commitment under the long term that now has start to pay off I think very much because of demanding for performance, quality, and functionality. And then as you say, brands are becoming more and more important. If you take air quality in China, it's equal to 3M. 3M stands for air quality in China. So that's actually our brand in China. And if you travel into China and you do some interviews, they will like to talk about respiratory products, about our things in filtration, et cetera. So I think it's coming back to brand awareness and the quality and functionality we're able to provide in the country. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : That makes sense. And just to follow up on that, I mean one of the things you've been doing, Inge, is trying to get more locally designed products in each of the regions. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Whether it be U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, and you've taken R&D up as a total spend, not just as a percent spend. But your revenues have grown, so you've taken it up meaningfully as a total spend. And how do you manage that structure, whereby you make sure you don't have guys working on duplicate projects? For air quality, for example, you've got guys in China working on new developments. And at the same time you've got guys in the U.S. working on the same things. I mean how do you really manage that complexity? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, we have our Senior Vice President from Research and Development that are managing the overall structure relative to how we do things. And there is very little duplication. And if you think about the science based off it, research and development, you think about research, there is four centers around the world that are doing the research. There's only four of them. Then you have \u2013 locally you will have capabilities for development. And that's a combination of the local business and the global division in order to manage that. So there is not duplication. And some time \u2013 to be honest, some time you can see duplication. But it's very, very seldom. And I think the advantage for us is sometime when someone is on something and find a solution for local market, we can replicate that other places. So will there be duplication sometime? Yes, I'm sure there will. But it's not much at all. And I think the evidence is there in terms of the outcome or the result. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Excellent. Keep up the good work, guys. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC : Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, John. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Morning, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Morning, Inge. So can we talk about investment spending in the quarter? I guess I thought you were going to be doing about $100 million. And you did $48 million. But maybe that was $100 million over two quarters. Maybe Nick could \u2013 what's going on there? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. For the total year we're on track for the total investment spending. We ended up having $40 million, mid-$40 million for investment spending for the third quarter. It's roughly a 50/50 mix of some of our footprint actions and the accelerated growth investments. And we're continuing to execute that plan. It's going according to the expectations we had for how this would play out for 2017. So I see it tracking just as we've planned it for the year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, Nick, you didn't spend less than you had planned in the third quarter? And that's coming through in the fourth quarter? Or no? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: In the fourth quarter we expect that to go up slightly to now to be \u2013 I can \u2013 I'll put in cents, earnings per share terms. That'll be $0.06 to $0.10 or roughly $70 million to $110 million of total incremental strategic investments. That will be more heavily focused on footprint than on growth. Because on the growth side, John, we're starting to lap ourselves with some of the growth investments that we started later in 2016. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay so $70 million to $100 million. That's incremental year over year, correct? That's... Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: That is correct, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It looks like inventory and receivables sort of sequentially as a function of sales maybe have moved up a little bit. Is that \u2013 I'm presuming that's, as a short cycle company, this is a response to channel fill. What is that? Is that new products that you're pushing through? Or is that actual pull-thorough from it could be a variety of sources. You're obviously a giant company, so it's hard to sort of parse that out. But what in fact is going on there? Is that just reflective of the global economy actually picking up? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. There is part of that that's the economy. So from an accounts receivable perspective, certainly our growth is the biggest driver of where we're seeing accounts receivable balances going up. On the inventory, that's also a function of the growth. The only thing on top of that I'd add is in the case of our business transformation effort, as we prepare to go-lives in different geographies around the world, one of the things we typically do is build some inventory in advance for our customers to ensure we can have an undisrupted supply chain for them. That's a little bit of what we're seeing right now. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: But I think important, John, is there is no channel fill by definition. We don't see anything in the channels that is abnormal for us. So I think that's important to put in place as well. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, if anything to your point, Inge, Consumer should have actually have had channel down fill, right? So is that still going on? And what was price in Consumer by the way? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: We don't typically put our price out by business group. And in the case of channel in the U.S., in the office supply channel we are continuing to see contraction there. Just not at the same level that we were seeing in the first half of this year, John. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll just ask one more, because that electrification of vehicle thing took up 17 questions. Gross margins, why were they down again this year for the first three quarters versus last year? Like, what's ultimately going on in the gross margin complexion of 3M today based on your businesses, you're spending versus last year? Why are they down? And do you think they will actually start to pick back up? Or is this all going to be about the OpEx management? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: John, I think you must be looking at our gross margin on an all-in published basis. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I am, yeah. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Part of what we've been doing this year is we have been doing a number of these supply chain footprint actions. Those costs are impacting our gross margin. When we strip that out, we are continuing to see slightly improving gross margins for 3M. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And that \u2013 when does that alleviate, Nick? When do you start to look at kind of a trend up on an all-in? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: In terms of our view on supply chain footprint actions, we originally laid out a year and a half ago that we expect between $500 million and $600 million of investments. We have done the majority, more than half of that, in 2017. So there will still be some footprint action expenses that we see in 2018. It will just be on a lower base than \u2013 a lower level than what we've seen in 2017. So it'll flip to become a tailwind for us from a margin perspective in 2018. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Morning, Joe. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So maybe touching on organic growth, clearly, really nice quarter and good acceleration. I guess if you look at the fourth quarter kind of implied guidance of call it like roughly 3.5% to 4%, a little bit of a deceleration, still good growth. But I'm just wondering like maybe you guys can comment on exit rates through the quarter and whether you're seeing anything interesting in the current rates. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe, in terms of trends that we saw throughout the third quarter and continuing into the first three weeks of the fourth quarter, we're seeing no change in trend. What you may be noticing in our guidance for the year is the fourth quarter will be our toughest comp for the entire year. But we're seeing no underlying deceleration in the trajectory of our sales revenue. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And maybe following on there, Nick, as the quarter progressed, was there any change throughout the quarter? Or was the quarter just pretty even throughout? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Joe, it was pretty strong throughout the quarter. There was no discernible trend between the different weeks or months of the third quarter. It was very even and strong throughout the quarter. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe just shifting gears a little bit to capital allocation. Clearly Safety & Graphics over the last couple years has been an area where you guys have invested. Looks like you're taking down the buyback a little bit this year. I'm just wondering as you're thinking about M&A across the portfolio, perhaps maybe prioritize where you think you guys should be putting your M&A dollars moving forward? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Well, I think first of all, the pipeline for all businesses is very good. And as you correctly have illustrated it, we have done acquisitions in Safety & Graphics specifically but also in Health Care, even if they have been smaller. I'm now talking the last couple of years. I think Safety & Graphics as a business group now, we had Capital Safety added in and now Scott Safety coming on the base that we have for our very strong franchise in personal safety. We're in a good position there to continue to accelerate that growth. And I would say that we have interest in all five business groups in order to do some additional thing. But as I said, we have now to make sure in Safety & Graphics that we focused everything in order to execute the implementation and integration of those businesses. But more than that, we are open to see where we can add businesses, that is strategically important for us and that are aligned with our four fundamental strengths, which is technologies, manufacturing capabilities, geographic reach, and brand equity. So if we can drive a faster return and fast return for ourself to those four fundamentals, and they are in a strategically good position in our portfolio, we are very interested. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Inge, maybe how much of a limiting factor right now is valuation? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: I think always there \u2013 it's not now. There's always \u2013 whenever you talk about that, there is always a limitation to it. Right? There's \u2013 and I think it's important for you to really decide on where would you like to make it strategically. Right? So you can see some of the acquisitions we have made, we have looked upon the real value it can add to use. And then we have paid for it. Right? We are \u2013 in my mind we are world-class company. We are interested to buy world-class companies that we can integrate and drive forward. So then you need to pay a little bit more, but not too much. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Hey, Steve. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hi, Steven. Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.: Morning, Steve. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Hey. I'll just \u2013 I'll keep it to two questions. The first one, Inge, you know 3M has faced I think a lot of skepticism around its ability to hold Health Care operating margin over time. So far you've proven that skepticism wrong. And as we're facing yet another sort of high level margin before the strategic investment for the quarter. So maybe comment a little bit on the pressures in Health Care globally? And how you're withstanding that? And your conviction going forward in the business' ability to continue to do that over time. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah, I think you're right. That, first of all, we've been in this business for a long time. It's a very attractive business to be in for reasons that we all know. The aging population trend, et cetera. I think the important thing is that you're able to provide at least two things. One is a benefit for the patient. And second, a benefit for the provider. And our portfolio is still right into those two things. That is what we do. And when you can add value even in an area like Health Care, which is very different than Industrial, you will be able to win in those segments. I don't know if you know, but I know that I was part, myself, of Health Care back in Europe in the early 1990s, 1991 to 1995 specifically. And there was a lot of pressure then through the German health care act. And what we had to do then was just, again, to prove the value for patients and for the provider and ourself, to be very efficient in the model in terms of manufacturing capabilities and logistics. And that's what we are doing. So when you look upon that specific business in terms of our growth rate, our margins, our cost of goods sold on SG&A, it's almost a perfect model for how you should do business in my mind. And you look upon that and you compare that to Safety & Graphics, they are soon at the same point. Not as high margins, but you can see the growth rate and very respectable margins of 25 plus percentage. It's again businesses that are regulated, it's about safety, it's about making sure that the patient or the worker always get the best. And people pay for that. And if you see Health Care, the acceleration we had in developing economy was 12%. The issue in developing economy is never quality, it's money. And as soon as the money is becoming available, 3M is one of the first products they will purchase into the system, based on key opinion leaders around the world writing papers of what is the best outcome in the treatment for patients. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, on I think a question also that you've tackled repeatedly. But given once again the strength in the quarter that's showing up, any thoughts going forward about revisiting taking on incremental leverage for growth investments going forward? You're I think below one time net debt to EBITDA? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah, Steve, you know our guidance of what we laid out for leverage over the course of five years. That we expect to add between $10 billion and $15 billion of leverage over that time. We've made progress in 2016 and progress on that in 2017 on that path. There's nothing changing on that front of seeing the capacity we have for adding that leverage. Steven Eric Winoker - UBS: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Morning. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'll keep it \u2013 covered a lot of ground, so I'll keep this very brief. So we've tackled the question on sustainability of organic sales. And obviously your 4Q guidance doesn't assume it continues. But I'm just trying to understand what caused the acceleration. And I know that there was some timing differences on days in 2Q. But do you have any intelligence in terms of the broad portfolio in terms of sell-in versus sell-through? I know in Consumer you got good data. But what about more broadly in Industrial and Health Care channels, sell-in versus sell-through. And were there any pricing increases or rebate concessions that maybe might have distorted the course? Or was this really just good end market demand? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: This is good commercialization and market demand that we capitalize on. On sell-in and sell-out is often talked about relative to the retail and consumer lines. And there was no difference in this quarter for us relative to sell-out and very much the same in terms of sell-in as well, specifically in the office supply channel. But there is nothing here in terms of us pushing something into the system in terms of any specific activities. As and I said earlier, we \u2013 our business model is around creating value for the end customer and for the OEMs in the industry. So there is nothing else here that is pushing the growth up. And as you can see, it's broad based. If you think about we have EEBG [Electronics & Energy business group] of 13%. We have Health Care of 7%; IBG [Industrial business group] and Safety/Graphic at 6%. And then Consumer, 2%. And you look upon geographically, APAC, 13%. And if you take out Electronics, it's still 8%. And then you have Latin America/Canada at 5%, United States, 4%, and Europe/Middle East/Africa, 4%. So it's broad based and it's all businesses, which is very, very encouraging for us. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No. No question. That's great detail. Thanks, Inge. And then on \u2013 Nick, on the raws, the $0.03 of benefit in 3Q. Obviously great job by the team. What does your plan embed for 4Q, just given the inflation we've seen post hurricane? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: And, Nigel, could you repeat that, the $0.03 benefit from what? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Raw materials. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: From raw materials. Yeah. We think that will \u2013 we think that will be flat to some benefit for us in Q4 and probably a little bit of a mixed dynamic there. As I said, we've seen pricing continuing to benefit. So from a price raw material, I think we'll still see increasing benefit from our selling prices. On the raw material benefit, we continue to see that as a tougher and tougher comp for us. Up until now, it's been offset by the projects we're doing, as I mentioned earlier. That will likely sustain. But I wouldn't be surprised if the benefit from that came \u2013 the net benefit came down slightly in the fourth quarter. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Good morning, Deane. Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Hey, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. I know we're into overtime here, so I'll keep it to one question. Can you talk about oral care in the U.S.? And how were you impacted by the ongoing distributor changes that's been causing stocking and restocking? And might you have picked up any more market share during this commotion? Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.: Yeah. Deane, I wouldn't say that we're in a position where we're declaring that we've picked up market share in the recent months or quarters. I would say this is a strong global business for us. And we are \u2013 we see lots of demand for our oral care solutions around the globe. The U.S. is down slightly in our oral care business. And it's a business where we haven't seen quite the channel fluctuations that you might be talking about. It's been pretty stable for us. The biggest driver for us in our oral care business is our demand in emerging markets and other parts of the world. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hello, Mr. Alexander? Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : So good morning, guys. So two quick ones if I may. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : The soft spots in your business, the stationery and the office and the commercial solutions in the safety and protection. Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : To what extent are those still core? Or how do they fit in the macro driven, mega trend driven, science-based growth that you were describing earlier? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And secondly, what are your criteria for adding new materials to your 46 technology platforms? Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Yeah. Well, if you \u2013 relative to the two divisions, if you start with the division in Safety & Graphics, that's a division that have a very strong precision with films that is one of our core technologies. If that is \u2013 in this case, is film for decoration, for brand equity building, but it's also the same type of I will say equipment and asset we are using for all our light management businesses. So that's a business that is very strong for us. And if you look upon the underlaying capabilities in order to produce those product, that's core to 3M. So there is no question around that business. And there is no question about office and supply either. That is where you have the Post-it. That's where we have the Scotch Tape, et cetera. So those are brand equity big businesses that we earn good money with. And our customers are on very, very good margins with them as well. So if you think about that from a perspective, also those businesses in stationery products, they are based on technologies that are very solid for 3M as an enterprise. So there is not even a question relative if they belong to 3M or not. So that's that answer. In terms of building out technology platforms, we have 46 as you said. In some cases, if we need to build out something, we will look upon that. And I think the latest \u2013 we have a couple of them during the last couple of years. One is the ceramic business, where we bought one company that in fact had a defense business of around $450 million. So we purchased that. What we really purchased was actually a technology platform that we'll deepen and broaden what we already had ourself in the ceramic. And that that could be used for many, many, many divisions. And we did one in Lebrona (1:09:00) that is a filter capabilities that we built into filtration and non-woven (1:09:07) capabilities, et cetera. So if we see a need to add something that we not can do our self or take too long time for us, we will go out and look for that. But again it's built on the demand from the market and where the market going for the future. It's not us sitting internally and look upon what we are doing and, yes, try to see what we should add. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.: Thank you. To wrap up, our team executed very well across enterprise and delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, including robust organic growth, increased earnings per share, and rising margins. The 3M playbook is working, and we are well-positioned going into 2018. Thank you for joining us. And I look forward to seeing you all in New York on December 12 for our outlook meeting. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and then ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 25, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2018 investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. This year's earnings conference calls will be held on April 24, July 24 and October 23. Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please that throughout today's presentation we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures, including measures which exclude the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand it off to Inge. Inge? Inge Thulin : Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. I will open with some comments on the fourth quarter and later in the call I will recap our full year performance. 3M had a strong finish to 2017 delivering robust organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and expanded our profitability while continuing to invest in the business. Looking at the numbers, we increased to $2.10 per share, up 12% year-on-year. Note, that this excludes the impact of tax reform recently enacted in the United States which Nick will discuss in detail. Our team delivered total sales of $8 billion, an all-time high for the fourth quarter. Organic growth company-wide was a strong 6% as our fundamental strength are enabling us to capitalize on an improving global economy. This includes very good performance from Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics, both of which grew 11% organically. Organic growth in our consumer business accelerated to 5%, its third consecutive quarter of positive growth. Industrial grew 4% organically and healthcare grew 3%. Organic growth was also broad-based across geographic areas led by Asia-Pacific at 12% and Europe, Middle East, Africa at 7%. The United States and Latin America, Canada each grew 3% organically. Turning to margins; our team executed well and expended margins to a healthy 23% with four of our five business groups above 22%. We also continue to invest in the business including research and development in CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Inge. Let me begin with a topic that is top of mind this earning season; the tax cuts and Jobs Act, and its impact on our fourth quarter results and beyond. Please turn to Slide 5; following the passage of the new tax legislation we recorded a net tax expense in Q4 of $762 million or $1.25 per share resulting in fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. This net tax expense includes the onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as true-ups of tax deferred assets and liabilities. Excluding this impact fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, an increase of 12% year-on-year. In addition, as a result of tax reform we now expect our 2018 tax rate to be between 20% and 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. Inge will provide more details on our updated 2018 guidance later in the call. Please note, that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of U.S. tax reform on 2017 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review fourth quarter sales. Sales growth remained strong in Q4, up 6% organically as we continue to outperform the markets we serve. Selling prices continue to improve throughout the year with fourth quarter up 20 basis points. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 40 basis points; our strongest quarterly pricing performance in 2017. The combination of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. This impact relates to the fourth quarter acquisition of Scott Safety, net of the divestiture of non-strategic businesses over the last 12 months. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 2.7 percentage points. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 9% versus last year. In the U.S. organic growth increased 3% with all business groups delivering positive growth. Growth was led by high single digit increases in both, Safety & Graphics and Electronics & Energy followed by consumer of mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 12% in Q4. All business groups within Asia-Pacific posted strong growth in the quarter led by double-digit increases in Safety & Graphics, Electronics & Energy and healthcare. Organic growth was 18% in China/Hong Kong, and 7% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China/Hong Kong grew 19% and Japan was up 5%. Moving to EMEA; organic growth was 7% in Q4 with West Europe up 5%. All business groups grew in the quarter with Safety & Graphics and Consumer leading growth in the area. Finally, Q4 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 3% led by a mid-single digit growth in consumer, industrial and healthcare. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 8% while Mexico and Brazil were both up 3%. Please turn to Slide 7 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion, up 9.4%. On a GAAP basis fourth quarter operating margins were 22.8% or 23.8% adjusting for year-on-year impacts from M&A, strategic investments and divestiture gains. Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Leverage on organic volume growth and productivity contributed 150 basis points to operating margins. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by a net 60 basis points, this result includes a 90 basis point impact related to the Scott Safety acquisition which closed in early Q4. The combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 40 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 60 basis points and higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, up 12% year-over-year. The benefits from organic growth and productivity were the predominant driver of earnings growth, contributing $0.33 to per share earnings in the quarter. On our October earnings call we described four items that would impact the fourth quarter, each of them came in as expected with per share earnings headwind of $0.07 from the acquisition of Scott Safety, $0.06 from incremental strategic investments and $0.11 from our high coupon debt tender while we recorded a benefit of $0.12 from the divestiture of the electronic monitoring business. In addition, there are two other items that I would like to comment on that impacted fourth quarter earnings. First, we updated our reserves for future potential respirator mask claims that we estimate could occur over the next several decades which resulted in a $0.07 year-on-year earnings headwind. Secondly, our Q4 tax rate was 23% versus 28.2% in the prior year which increased earnings by $0.13 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, geographic profit mix and equity-based compensation. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 268%. Included in these results is the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that we made following the signing of tax reform. The net impact of these two items benefited Q4 free cash flow conversion by 112 percentage points. For the full year free cash flow conversion was 100% with a 3 percentage point benefit from tax reform, net of our $600 million pension contribution. Turning to CapEx; fourth quarter capital expenditures were $459 million with the full year totaling $1.4 billion. Also in the fourth quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full year 2017 we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.8 billion and gross share repurchases of $2.1 billion. Looking ahead to 2018 we remain encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in the business to improve both, growth and productivity while continuing to return significant cash to our shareholders. Thus in light of these opportunities coupled with tax reform we are increasing the top end of our 2018 CapEx expectation $100 million to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. In addition, we now expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $4 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 10. The industrial business group posted organic growth of 3.9% in Q4 and 4.9% for the year. Our heartland businesses within industrial had a good finish to the year with abrasives up high single digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive aftermarket both grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Our automotive OEM business was up 5% continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Finally, the separation and purification business grew low single digits while advanced materials declined year-on-year against last year's strong comp. On a geographic basis industrials organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific followed by mid-single digit growth in both, EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $527 million with an operating margin of 19.4%. Underlying margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and a Q4 2016 gain on divestiture. Please turn to Slide 11; fourth quarter Safety & Graphic sales grew 10.7% organically with double digit increases across both, developed and developing markets. Our personal safety business posted double digit organic growth in Q4 with broad-based growth across all geographies. The roofing granules business had a strong finish to the year as a result of the rebuilding efforts following last fall's hurricanes. Transportation Safety was up mid-single digits with particular strength in reflective sheeting for roadway infrastructure. This business continues to transform its portfolio to focus on the connected roadways of the future. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas led by an 18% increase in Asia-Pacific, 12% increase in EMEA and a 9% increase in the U.S. Operating income was $406 million and underlying operating margins were up 370 basis points year-on-year adjusting for the Scott Safety acquisition, divestiture impacts and incremental strategic investments. Please turn to Slide 12; healthcare increased 3.1% organically in the fourth quarter. For the full year healthcare grew nearly 4% with second half organic growth of 5%. In Q4 our medical consumables business which includes advanced wound management and infection prevention solutions posted mid-single digit organic growth. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter as we continue to post strong international growth, particularly in developing markets. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by high single digit increases in both Food Safety and Health Information Systems which posted its strongest growth quarter of the year. On a geographic basis healthcare grew across all geographies with continued strength in developing markets which were up 15% in the quarter. Healthcare's fourth quarter operating income was $464 million and operating margins were 31.5%. Next let's cover Electronics & Energy on Slide 13. Electronics & Energy organic sales growth was 11% for the fourth quarter and the full year. The electronic side of the business grew 14% organically as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, displays, data centers and automotive electrification. Our energy related businesses were up 4% organically with electrical markets up high single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. We continue to actively manage our Electronics & Energy portfolio in the quarter with the announced divestiture of the communications markets business. On a geographic basis organic growth was led by a 15% increase in Asia-Pacific although U.S. was up high single digits and EMEA up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $334 million with operating margin of 25.2%. Underlying margins were up 80 basis points year-on-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and the gain on sale of non-core intellectual property in Q4 2016. Please turn to Slide 14; consumer continued to deliver improved organic growth in the fourth quarter, up 5.4%, its strongest quarterly organic growth since Q4 2014. Consumer posted organic growth across all businesses and geographic areas in the fourth quarter. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically continuing its track record of strong performance throughout 2017. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Command, ScotchBlue, Infiltrate [ph]. We also saw good growth in consumer healthcare with notable strength in our next care branded bandages. Looking at consumer geographically growth was led by high single digit increases in both, EMEA and Asia-Pacific although U.S. and Latin America/Canada increased mid-single digits. Finally, operating income increased 18% to $269 million with an operating margin of 22.9%. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Inge. Inge? Inge Thulin : Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2017 we executed a 3M playbook and deliver on each of our four long-term financial metrics which we laid out at our Investor Day in March 2016. We posted earnings of $9.17 per share, a 12% increase year-on-year. Organic growth was a robust 5% with positive growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We posted free cash flow conversion of 100% along with a return on invested capital of 21%, and for the fourth consecutive year we expanded margins companywide coming in at 25% in 2017. Beyond these financial results we continued to make good progress on our three key levers which are significant value creators. The first lever is portfolio management. In October we finalized the acquisition of Scott Safety as we continue to build strings-on-strings in our personal safety portfolio. At the same time we divested four businesses that no longer align with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management is strengthening our competitiveness and making us even more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. I will move onto investing and innovation which is the second lever. 3M's primary growth metric is organic local currency sales growth as we invent unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. That is why research and development is the heartbeat of 3M; and in 2017 we invested $1.9 billion in R&D or 6% of sales. And as you can see in our results, these investments are paying off in terms of organic growth and also our premium margins and return on invested capital. Business transformation is the third lever which starts and ends with our customers. The rollout of ERP system in West Europe is nearly complete and we have started initial deployments in the United States. I'm pleased with how our teams around the world are executing business transformation which is already benefiting our customers and 3M. In summary, 2017 was a strong year for our enterprise and we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another successful performance in 2018. Please turn to Slide 16; here you see our updated planning estimates for 2018. We now anticipate earnings of $10.20 to $10.70 per share, up from the previous range of $9.60 to $10. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% to 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. The remainder of our guidance is unchanged. Organic growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5% and we continue to anticipate strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 17; for more than a century the strings of 3M business model has enabled us to invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders; this has included a strong steady and rising dividend which is a hallmark of our enterprise. Over the last five years we have doubled 3M's special dividend and today we are announcing a 16% increase in our first quarter dividend for 2018 to $1.36 per share. This marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases and reflects confidence in our ability to continue generating premium returns in 2018 and beyond. With that I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : My first question is on Electronics & Energy; clearly you guys are exiting especially in the electronics segment, exiting the year very strongly yet a couple of companies in the supply chain reported yesterday very good results, yet the organic growth profile is still expected at 1% to 4% for 2018. Is that just conservatism or are there other puts and takes that we need to be aware of for this year? Inge Thulin : First of all, we are very pleased with the momentum we see in that business and you see those multiple things that is moving us forward and it's all coming back to the way we have repositioned the portfolio in the past. We are coming off stronger in the end of the year than we went into the year for 2017. As Nick said in his remarks, we continue to be expecting on multiple platforms and that should of course reflect more growth as we go. It's too early for us however as we asked into the third week of January to exchange the guidance that we have for the total enterprise and all that business. But I would say that the momentum is there and we see this as a very positive business for us as we move ahead but it's too early for me and for us to change the guidance but I wouldn't be overly concerned at all about that business. Joe Ritchie : Maybe shifting gears a little bit; Nick, just focused on capital allocation for a second saw that growth repurchase number went up, it seems like you've got a little bit around $4 billion or so on your balance sheet. Do -- should we be thinking about the pace of capital deployment being a little bit faster now that you have access to your international cash as well? Nicholas Gangestad : The big longer term picture of our capital allocation plan that's not really changing, the way we're investing first in the business, supplementing that with acquisitions that we think makes sense and fit well with our business and then also returning cash to shareholders, that whole capital allocation strategy is unchanged, tax reform and the ability to access international cash a little easier does give us added flexibility. And in the short-term you're seeing a few things change, slightly raising the high-end of our CapEx range, also on our share buybacks and our 16% dividend increase. Those are the things in the short-term they are immediately changing, I will also point out that late in the year we did add an extra $600 million to our U.S. pension immediately following the U.S. signing of this into law. So in the short-term those are the things we're doing but the long-term, our overall strategy isn't changing. Joe Ritchie : And if you don't mind me just sneaking in one more; I just wanted to ask you about FX, I saw that you guys didn't change your guidance for FX but the dollar has weekend since you originally gave guidance. So two part question; shouldn't you have a better benefit from FX or is your hedging policy not going to allow you to have an increased benefit? And then secondly, typically you're able to pass-through greater price when the dollar weakens and so if you can comment on that that would be helpful. Nicholas Gangestad : To the first point even as recent as last week when we look at our exchange rates and the impact on our earnings, $0.10 that we guided in December that's a very good estimate for the total year. If that changes we'll start to modify that but I think that's still a very solid number to go with. To the second part of your question, I think you may have it reversed when the dollar strengthens against developing markets in developing market economies that's where we see some upward price actions that we take; it's usually not in the reverse. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Inge, can you talk about the 11% growth that you saw in Safety & Graphics in Q4? We obviously remember you saying that Safety & Graphics is the next potential big breakout candidate; do you think that the big difference now in Safety & Graphics is commodity based growth within personal safety and really starting to come back and this uplift actually looks sustainable in '18 given the higher commodity prices and maybe it's all the work you've done in portfolio management but how does that make the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for '18 look? Could it actually end up being conservative? Inge Thulin : Well, first of all your memory is good. I said that that is our next breakout business and it is the breakout business as we speak, right. And if you think about the portfolio there, we also in that business as we did in EEBG took some very heavy lifting relative to the portfolio, it took us more than three years, one was four years to complete, right; so you think about that portfolio how we have let some businesses get new onus where we didn't see that we could accelerate and develop those businesses to a level that we in 3M expect us to deliver, and then we build out specifically in personal safety to today be a world-class leader in the whole personal safety area. That is continuing, that's a fantastic business for us, [indiscernible] speak when you look upon the portfolio, that is -- in some cases regulated businesses and in some cases is more consumables that we capitalize on. So in my view the other thing that is working as a positive for us is, we have now sought out also our portfolio in traffic safety. Traffic safety today is back to the core, is back to what we know how to do and where strings are; and as you know, we are also linking that business now together with automotive electrification where we now have automotive, we have EEBG and we have Safety & Graphics working on initiatives around that whole space. So I would say that again, it's a little bit early but the momentum is very good in that business, generally speaking, and it's not only personal safety. We saw now for the first time a shift to us in traffic safety that will actually be positive for us as we move ahead. Again, it's too early, I would like to make changes if you can or you're very confident to the growth rate for the year but as you know, I'm also a little bit conservative so I will wait with that, do we have at least one or two quarters behind us so we with confidence can give you different figure. But again, this is a fantastic business and I'm as proud of what they have done a some in EEBG in terms of really direct those businesses to much more relevant place for us where we can grow in a very profitable way? Nicholas Gangestad : It looks like you're stationary in office business with consumer goods sit first time in several quarter and you mentioned in the presentation itself the e-commerce. Do do you think the channel environment issues that you've facing in that segment are behind you or is it that you've just getting penetration into those feel even three things in math fragmenting out behind you or is it that you're just getting better penetration into the van market three commissariat off the channel inventory issues. I think is both, you know we have talked about that business for some quarter in terms of the inventory position for them right and we have -- I think in every quarter have had better sales out than sales in right; so they have adjusted their position in that space. So I think it's both, you coming to a point where your comparison is easier but also inventory levels is on a better level. So we don't see at this point in time an issue with inventories in that space for the consumer business. So this is in fact the third consecutive quarter that our consumer business group is growing, this time by 5% and in fact also to a price which is very good. On a companywide as you touch on online sales, for us in the quarter our online sales as an enterprise was up 21% and for the year was 13%; so it's moving in the right direction for the consumer business so we're very pleased with that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : The sky assets you bought, it's an interesting business; if there is one reason another title is never really able to grow it -- I think it was kind of 1% grow forever. What can you guys do differently with this thing? Is it more function of -- taking the brand more globally? Is there other things that you can do to get it upto really a 3M average growth type business? Inge Thulin : I think first of all for us that brings synergy, it brings scale and efficiency into the SCBA priority categories, right. So I think from that perspective we can add it in and become much more relevant to the customers on the market. And so the presence in gas detection is becoming much much more relevant for us and it enhanced our ability to deliver on customer solutions; so if you think about that whole personnel safety space if you like, we have now build that out from initially started to be world leader in respiratory products and then we purchased some years back, maybe 5 to 8 years back we purchased cornels [ph] welding business and then here in the later years we purchased capital safety which is full protection and now Scott Safety that is building us out in that whole space. So by definition we will be able to drive the synergy in scale in that business and be more relevant to big customers around the world, right. They are looking for as few supplier as possible but this is a regulated business, they also would like to work with companies that have a high reputation around quality and safety and that's what we stand for. So there is a lot of leverage there for us and that business is doing very well for us. We met the expectation in the quarter, the team is very energized, both our core team and the Scott Safety group that came into us. And you'll be able to now to manufacture and innovate safe products based on our technology. So we can add more on the technology side and I think we will be very effective into commercialization part of that business. Scott Davis : Obviously, it's a great brand and anything called Scott has to be pretty good. Getting exciting I asked you a question that's kind of a little bit off the path here and I haven't asked this to any companies yet; I mean this Tax Act thing is really interesting and I haven't heard anybody comment whether this is something that can help you cut your tax -- your corporate G&A tax cost and supply chain. And what I mean by that is, I know that some companies didn't necessarily have the most optimized supply chain set up but inter-company, things moving around essentially just to avoid taxes -- I'm not accusing you guys of avoiding taxes, just saying there is some structures that were created maybe that weren't efficient overtime. Is there anything there and as far as actual costs that come down from this Tax Act is it just the fact you're just paying lower taxes or is this real -- is there something else there too? Nicholas Gangestad : Scott, there is a couple of things I'll go into on this. One is, we've been on a journey for several years to be really optimizing our supply chain and how to operate that as efficiently and effectively as possible and part of that has been our centers of expertise that we've set up in different parts of the world to drive operationally efficiency; that also has some tax benefits to us and the strategies that we've put in place to optimize our supply chain that were relevant before, continue to be relevant for us and driving benefits for us going forward, in fact we're going to continue that type of effort and expand that. Underlying of the impact of the tax reform; there are different pieces of that, some impacting different companies differently, obviously just lowering the tax rate to -- in the U.S. to 21% is a benefit to a company like 3M. But in addition, the U.S. Tax Code, the new U.S. tax law does give some favorable handling to companies that are net exporters out of the U.S. and part of the benefit that you're seeing 3M as we guide 20% to 22% is that we're a net exporter of approximately $3.5 billion out of the U.S. of what we manufacture, that's also part of that benefit that you're seeing for our company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Nick, why did U.S. pricing -- I apologize if you said this before; it looks like it got worst sequentially but you had very easy comparisons from last year. I'm surprised the U.S. went from minus 2 to minus 7 but your price in the U.S. goes from minus 2 to minus 3; what -- 0.3 obviously; what's going on? Nicholas Gangestad : John, throughout all of 2017 -- I'll frame it just a little bit longer where -- if I go back to '15 and '16, less growth in the U.S., part of our focus in 2017 is ensuring that our U.S. operations are growing and productive and that's what we've seen so for instance in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter growing 3% organically. Now throughout the four quarters of 2017 in our U.S. we've been hovering around 20 or 30 basis points of price decline, the single biggest thing driving that John has not changed throughout the entire year and that's that as we now be -- now moving to growth in the U.S. we do have rebate incentive plans with our most loyal customers and our best performing customers that's been part of our business model and part of that model is, they get some price break via rebates and that's by far the single biggest thing impacting price that we're posting in the U.S. in 2017; really unchanged from the other three quarters of 2017. John Inch : [Indiscernible] is not showing up within your segments because U.S. industrial core growth was up only 1% this quarter and it was up 5% last quarter but -- so I'm assuming that's not an industrially weighted rebate program, is that kind of on the consumer side, is that why consumer did a little better or\u2026 Nicholas Gangestad : John, there are some aspects of that in all of our businesses but the U.S. and Safety & Graphics I would say are more heavily weighted to having those types of pricing plans. John Inch : So was there something about U.S. industrial as to why it seemed like its core growth slowed considering we're sort of living in what appears to be an accelerating industrial economy, certainly in the fourth quarter. Was there timing issues or mix issues or what was going on there? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, if you're looking at our growth in the U.S. in industrial, the one big thing I'll point out is fourth quarter of last year of 2016; we had approximately a $40 million defense contract that we won and sold that -- that quarter -- that is -- that's the single biggest thing, if we pulled that out we have had very nice accelerating growth in our industrial business. John Inch : Kind of at what level though? So if you were to apples-to-apples, that defense business where is the U.S.? I'm just trying to get a sense of how your U.S. business is cadencing; is that kind of a low single digit, mid-single digit, what's the trend? Nicholas Gangestad : Pulling that out we would have been in the mid-single digit range, John. John Inch : Okay, so that makes sense. And then, just -- back to the pricing lastly; it's sort of obvious that there is inflation in the economy, I mean how far the inflation -- I mean U.S. economy, how far it carries is another matter but maybe Inge, what are your thoughts or neck it toward being able to recapture your own input cost pressures whether they'd be healthcare, rising wage pressures, other sort of things and being able to kind of pass that through and you sort of juxtapose that against what you've just described as a price down program to try and stimulate some U.S. volumes. So I guess this is rising in U.S. inflation and possibly a bit of a headwind incrementally for margins or how can you manage it? Nicholas Gangestad : John, over a period of time we've been able to get 30 to 50 basis points of price growth. Now in 2017 we were approximately flat on price growth, we're highly confident in 2018 that we'll be back into the range of 30 to 50 basis points of price growth over \u2013 throughout 2018. Inge Thulin : John, let me also correct you on one thing. You say the price down [ph] initiative is not the price down initiative; it is what Nick said you know, what is happening -- there is an increase in the incentive program rebates to the loyal customers and channel partners, that's what it is. So it doesn't start with a price down initiative and I'd like to correct you on that, it's not the price down; so what you see on that line with Nick clearly said to you and to us is to say it's about the incentive programs and we have set up now for two quarters in a row. John Inch : Yes, I'm sorry; the volume rebates, the more you buy\u2026 Nicholas Gangestad : I thought you said price down and that's not correct. John Inch : No, I think I misspoke. I do know what you mean and taking into -- I'm didn't mean to provide a cutting price, you're giving incentives for people to buy more. Nicholas Gangestad : Exactly. John Inch : So my last question that is the 30 to 50 given the pressures in the economy is that going to be enough Nick? Like, I don't have visibility into how much the emerging inflation in The United States is actually going to potentially pressure your operations; I mean historically you've got very strong margins so I don't expect substantial margin pressure, I just want to think -- understand how you're thinking about managing this. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, in terms of how we're thinking about and managing 30 to 50 I feel highly confident on. Directionally, I feel there is more upside on that than downside, partially for what -- exactly what you're talking about John that inflationary environment and increasing raw material prices; if there is a bias towards that it's towards the high-end or above and not to the low end or below. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Couple of questions on the slide deck Page 8 on GAAP adjustments; and for Nick just starting on the tax rate, the benefit this quarter you called out supply chains but it lacks excellence and geographic profit mix. At $0.13 that's not related to tax reform, is that correct? And is this more -- is this a sustainable benefit or how would you characterize it? Nicholas Gangestad : Deane, you are first of all correct, that has nothing to do with tax reform that we've isolated separately. And the three things I talked about, let me give you a little more depth of that -- of what's driving that. Year-on-year we are seen, our centers of expertise and their efficiency and the profitability in those grow and that's certainly a part of our strategy and sustainable that we expect and also captured in our 20% to 22% guidance for 2018. The geographic profit mix which is the smallest of the three is where do we actually earn that profit, how much is being earned in our highest tax jurisdictions versus the lowest and that will vary from year to year. And then the last is stock-based compensation, and we get a tax benefit as we have more of our employees exercising stock options; that one will be the most variable and as our stock price has gone up and we have employees exercising stock options we're getting a larger benefit from that than we've had a year ago. Deane Dray : And then just as a follow-up; we're going through the segment color, auto came up a couple of different times, once in the electronic side on auto electrification and then it's always been in industrial. I'm just -- would like to hear from Inge on how you coordinate when a business or an end market crosses segments, the go-to-market strategy and -- are there additional kind of coordination efforts that need to make sure it goes smoothly? Inge Thulin : Yes, there is. So first of all, we have appointed a Vice President to lead a portion inside of automotive that we call automotive electrification, and it's he that is coordinating the activities going on in the company relative to the face into the automotive business. We also monitor and manage the result out of that enterprise, so we look upon what we have called -- still call automotive business, OEM business and then we have a line out that we call automotive electrification underperformance of that; and we see that we are improving our performance in automotive electrification. So that piece of the business we had 15% growth in Q4 and in total of automotive we have done very, very well as well. So that piece is growing overtime and as we have said earlier, that's a $6 billion addressable market opportunity growing maybe 6% to 8%; and so that's big opportunity for us when we add those two together. But it's working very well for us and -- then I said earlier; I think in addition for us from a competitive perspective is that we are both very engaged with the automotive OEM customer but also with the highway transportation authorities across the world in order to build out something that I think can be remarkable as you look down the road so to speak relative to that opportunity for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : I just wanted to clarify on John's question regarding rebates in North America. Am I correct in thinking that you sort of have a growth rate in view and then you said rebates relative to this growth rate; so if people exceed them they get better rebates. So if you set the growth rate higher next year, rebates would kick in at a higher growth rate; is that a fair way of looking at it? Nicholas Gangestad : Andrew, I'd say that's a very fair way of looking at it. We started with a growth expectation and 2017 is a year where many of our customers exceeded that growth expectation, getting higher rebates; that becomes part of the base as we reset those targets for the coming year. And in comparison in '15 and '16, we had below average rebate payments; so we're seeing it from '16 to '17 swing from below to above in '17. I think '18 will be more of a normalized year. Andrew Obin : And just to go back on automotive electrification; I think Inge was quoted in The Wall Street Journal before the New Year sort of saying that you guys could have billions of opportunity from EV and I just can't resist but I ask -- but to ask at the Analyst Day, I think you sort of thought it was a great opportunity; Inge was quoted saying it was billions. If you could just sort of talk a little bit about sort of underlying assumptions about what the market looks like by the time you have those billions from EV and its billions -- $2 billion, $10 billion, anything will be appreciated. Thank you. Inge Thulin : Well, as I said addressable market is $6 billion. And if you think about the whole area for us where we can make a difference in that whole industry and then put on the electrification to the cause, so we have some of management, we have light weightening, we have sensors were displaced, we have [indiscernible] and vertical signings and payment markings; so that's -- think about that in the whole area. If you look upon automotive electrification at this point in time, for us that's around $200,000 million in size and growing very fast. So the first billion should be in reach rather sooner than later but we'll take a couple of years. But for me and the team here, this is a unique opportunity for 3M to capitalize on our technologies and the connection we have in the industry because the industry here if you think about it, if you think very narrow then you think automotive and automotive electrification, this is bigger than that; this coming into the whole highway transportation area and I thought it's relative to regulations around it and we had been in Traffic Safety for over 80 years, we have the connection, we work with them daily; so when you put this all together we would be in a very, very good position to move forward. So you know, we're very, very encouraged to what we see and the momentum and already early spec ins on the automotive -- on platforms that will not come immediately but is coming maybe 18 to 24 months out as those platforms go into production. Andrew Obin : And when you say $6 billion of market opportunity, should we expect 3M to capture a 3M like market share within that market? Inge Thulin : Why not? We don't commit in order to go in and do something less than that. So that is what you should expect and that's what we expect here, we expect that from ourselves, right; so that's -- when we commit to do it we will do it the right way and we will be focused on it. So we will take market share as we move ahead and I believe when we look upon these three to five years from now, I think we will -- maybe done it right, we will all say that was a masterstroke. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Just on kind of next year, now that you have a betted [ph] more of a turn of the car drove to December -- how do you see kind of seasonality playing out; anything in the comparisons here in electronics or anything else that we should expect when thinking about quarterly growth progression as it move through the year or is it pretty steady all around the three to five? Nicholas Gangestad : Steve, our view is it's a pretty steady throughout the year, we're not seen any big outliers one direction or the other, it's as pretty as close to down the middle of the road as we could be. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then this -- the CapEx; is that a minor step-up, is that sustainable longer term or is that just hey we're going to invest a little bit here with the new tax regime and it will begin to migrate back down over the long-term? Nicholas Gangestad : Our longer term guidance Steve of 4.5% to 5% I still see that as the right long-term view but in light of what we see in the economy; in light of tax reform, in light of investment opportunities around disruptive technologies that can help us -- make us more efficient, all that in combination is causing us to up our planned spend slightly this year but 4.5% to 5% is still the right range in the longer term. Stephen Tusa : And then one more; just when you look at the earnings bridge that you guys gave in December, any tweak to that? I guess strategic investments this year came in a little bit lower but there were some other moving parts like the legal settlement etcetera; so any anything in that bridge that moves around that you wanted to highlight, the earnings bridge? Nicholas Gangestad : No, it is January; so other than the update in tax we're not changing anything. As things start to play out after a quarter or two, there might be some tweaks like we're clearly watching FX and what that's doing; raw materials that continues to be a moving target for us. And then share repurchase is another one that I say we continue to watch of what it's impact going to be on EPS. Stephen Tusa : The gain in the safety business; did that run just to profit not the revenue, correct? Just to be clear. Nicholas Gangestad : Correct, that was all through operating income, no revenue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Now that we're seeing Scott Safety be integrated capital; the last big one, before that I guess it was Polly [ph], so something like $5.5 billion been on the transactions and your result so far even if there was criticism about initial price paid on the street resulting to be pretty impressive as far as growth etcetera and I assume you're heading towards your return on capital targets. Are you thinking again in terms of the profile for 3M, the ability to kind of find and digest M&A becoming an even more accelerated part of the growth story at a nearer term or is it still just steady as she goes? Inge Thulin : Well, as you know primary objective and strategy is organic local currency growth, right, and that's also why we invest in research and development with around 6%, right; last year that's like $1.9 billion, and that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is what is providing us with premium solutions for customers and premium returns for shareholders; I think that's an important element. Now we have shift activities in the portfolio in order to build out relevance with our customers and markets, and we will continue to do that in order to compliment as we move ahead in areas that we are interested to do and our pipeline is good, we have many alternatives to look upon and I think as we go you will see probably the same steady path as we had in the past. So I don't think that has changed on that as we move ahead; as long as we get the growth on the investment we do in research and development and we do as we speak and we have also as you see stepped up to growth where we had complemented with good solid acquisitions that we've integrated to the company and I don't know if you recognize that but we have also worked with -- we buy world-class asset, we don't buy something that we need to fix and try to move in; and the reason for that is there should be good processes in place from the company we buy, there should be world-class management that can come into 3M and with this -- the four fundamental strings we have we can create value as fast as possible for our shareholders. Steven Winoker : Nick, maybe you could put a fire point on the commodity side; I mean I know when a lot of the factories on that -- heist [ph] is another -- you guys appear certainly more vertically integrated than a lot of other multi-industrial model for a lot of reason but maybe just refresh us in terms of what the commodity exposure is these days and how you're thinking about just that side of the framework? Nicholas Gangestad : Steven, in total we've spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion a year on raw materials, commodities and some purchase finished goods to go into our cost of goods sold; it's approaching half of our total cost of goods sold. And it is spread out over a lot of different commodity basis but to put a bit of a finer point and this may or may not be what you're asking; we are seeing underlying commodity prices that were paying, we're seeing them go up and yet we are still reporting all in that we're getting some of the benefit. So in the fourth quarter it's a bit of a transition quarter for us that we are seeing slightly higher market prices we're paying for our commodities which currently are being more than offset by our own sourcing initiatives to bring down the cost of the materials and that can be revamping our products to use a lower raw material, can be changing the source of supply, can be some negotiations that we go through; that's still resulting in a net benefit for us year-on-year but the underlying commodity prices we are now seeing a year-on-year increase in those prices. Steven Winoker : And can you size that all that the increase itself? Nicholas Gangestad : 1% or slightly less than 1%; it's still a pretty muted number for us. Steven Winoker : And if you were advising investors to look at a few specific commodities for that 1% which one should we look at? Nicholas Gangestad : There is about one-eighth of our entire commodity base that is petroleum based and when we first set our guidance we had an expectation of oil prices in the $50 to $60 a barrel, that's gone up; so there is some sensitivity there for oil derivative products that go into some of our tapes and adhesives and films. Operator : Our next question comes from the line to Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicholas & Company. Please proceed with your question. Robert McCarthy : On Steve's question about commodities, in particular oil; I mean in the past you have given a little bit more granular sensitivity, particularly in the retrenchment that occurred in 2014 through mid-2016 timeframe. Could you just kind of level set expectations on the upside with respect to that given the fact that oil started to move up pretty materially here and we could see even a potential oil shock if there is a geopolitical hiccup of some sort. And then, just -- if you could talk about maybe the embedded energy exposure of the portfolio overall because we probably learned a lot from the downturn about businesses that were tied into energy and affected the interim [ph] organic growth and how do you think about that sensitivity if we start to move our way up with the whole petrochem complex? Nicholas Gangestad : Rob I think there's a couple different dimensions; I'll talk to the raw material side and then I'll talk to the market dimension side. What I've said in the past is a $10 move in oil manifest for us in about a $0.02 to $0.03 annual raw material headwind for us or $0.02 to $0.03 whatever direction oil is moving, it's going up, it's a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind for us and that comes from things like -- some of the resins we buy that have a crude oil derivative that goes into that. So that's on the commodity side but I think you also might be talking about the market itself; so when we saw oil prices drop late '14 into '15 our overall market exposure, we still see about 3% of our total revenue that's tied to the oil and gas industry. So if there is -- as we've seen that stabilize that's been a help to us and if there is an uptick that's certainly a positive for us on the revenue perspective. Robert McCarthy : In the context of these continued progress on these European investments could you just kind of level set what your expectations for asking to be a longer term for SKU rationalization of the company? And what that could mean from benefits not only to operating margin through simplification and then working capital benefits, just risk -- you're carrying probably less inventory and less complex inventory; could you just talk about that? Nicholas Gangestad : What we've laid out is that by 2020 we expect $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit through what we're doing through our business transformation, as well as $0.5 billion of working capital coming out of our supply chain as a result of that; that remains unchanged. And in December I think if you were listening to what we are saying, we also are starting to see benefits beyond that that it's not a just a plateau of that and it's a steady state, we see that continuing to grow. Now topics like SKU rationalization, that is one component; we don't have it carved out of this is exactly what SKU rationalization is of that total piece but what we do see is looking at our portfolio, the SKUs we have which ones make sense which ones don't, that is part of what we're doing as we transform our business and our business processes. So it's a component, what I can't tell you is how much of a component that is of that total $500 million to $700 million that we're projecting. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff [ph] of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Nick, I've seen a few multinationals unable to bring down tax rate as much maybe all of us would have thought on some of the simple spreadsheet map, obviously that's about the case here for you. Some company is mentioning this so-called guilty tax as minimum tax issue, does that not apply to you? Does the export situation negate that? Can you give us -- if it's possible to give us a nutshell answer to that. Nicholas Gangestad : The acronym guilty and the acronym beat those components that I know are negatively impacting some other companies are having a negligible or non-existent impact on 3M. Unidentified Analyst : And then I was also just wondering back to the discussion around equity compensation on tax rate; any change on how we should think about the flipside of that equation, in other words the differences between gross repo and net repo as you deal with the dilution on the shareholder -- I'm sorry, on the employee side? Nicholas Gangestad : In the past we've said that we need about $1 billion of share growth -- share repurchase just to offset that dilution; that's come down slightly, I believe it's right now around $800 million. That's not changing materially and we're thinking the $700 million to $800 million is a more longer term steady state of what we need just to offset dilution. Unidentified Analyst : And then just finally, I heard what was said on the bridge; one that just jumps up for me a little bit though is pension. If I think about all those 2018 bridge items with the contribution here and I think a decent bump on the long. Is that dime [ph] a pension headwind fully baked in the cake or is that possibly moving around a little bit? Nicholas Gangestad : That is the final number, so as the pension contribution helped it the lowering of interest rates and therefore our discount rates in the last few weeks of December more or less offset that; so it's call those a push and where I still write at the dime that we said. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : How should we think about incremental margins over the year that is -- should wage and input cost pressure increase in the second half? Nicholas Gangestad : In the second half of 2018? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Nicholas Gangestad : No. As far as wages what we're expecting for wage costs increases in 2018; it remains very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years, really no change on our ability to generate incremental leverage. So we are not seeing a shift up or down in the pace of wage increases that we've seen historically. Unidentified Analyst : And the second question; how long can you sustain the current pace of growth in Asia before you need to accelerate investment in new capacity? Nicholas Gangestad : So we have been consistently investing in our capacity in Asia, working to increase our regional self-sufficiency of more and more that we are selling in the Asia Pacific is being manufactured in Asia Pacific. Right now we still have capacity and we will continue to sustain it, I don't see it a dramatic change in direction of the amount of CapEx going in, it's been at about the right pace and we think it's a pretty sustainable pace we're at; so I don't see a big direction change on that. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge Thulin : Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter capped a strong year for us here at 3M; and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 3M team for their contributions to a successful 2017 and for moving us closer to our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. We are positioned well going into 2018 and we will deliver another successful year. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; Mike Roman, our Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Inge and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events in 2018 found on Slide 2. Please mark your calendars for our upcoming earnings calls on July 24 and October 23. Also, we have established a date for our next Investor Day, which will be held at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday, November 15. More details will be available as we get closer to the event. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in particular, measures which exclude the impact of the measurement adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the previously disclosed legal settlement with the State of Minnesota. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Lastly, we filed a Form 8-K on March 15, updating our business segment reporting for dual credit and reflecting the adoption of the new financial accounting standard relative to pension and post-retirement benefit cost. Both of these updates are reflected in our reported results and on a historical basis starting this quarter. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand off to Inge. Inge? Inge Thulin : Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Coming off a strong 2017, our team opened the new year with broad-based organic growth across all business groups. We expanded margins and posted a double-digit increase in earnings per share while continuing to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the first quarter numbers, we deliver earnings of $2.50 per share, a 16% increase year-on-year. Total sales rose to $8.3 billion, which is an all-time high for our enterprise. Company-wide, organic growth was 3%. Three of our business groups, Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer, all posted good growth that was within or above their expected full year ranges. Safety and Graphics delivered another robust performance with 7% organic growth, coming off 6% growth in 2017. As you know, we have significantly adjusted the Safety and Graphics portfolio over the last several years, and those actions continued to pay off in terms of improved growth and margins. Electronics and Energy posted 2% growth in the quarter with strong growth in data center and semiconductor markets. Within this business group, we have also adjusted the portfolio in recent years, and we now see, in addition to growth, continued and sustained improvements in margins. Consumer also delivered 2% organic growth, its fourth straight quarter of positive growth, with particular strengths in our home improvement business. Our Health Care and Industrial Business Groups, which grew 3% and 2%, respectively, each had many areas of strengths but also few areas of softness that temper overall growth. Within Health Care, we delivered good growth in medical consumables, health information systems and food safety. We saw flat growth in oral care and sales in drug delivery were down against a tough comparison. Turning to our Industrial Business Group. Industrial opened the year with 2% growth with good performance in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes. Automotive OEM business also grew well and once again outperformed global auto builds despite negative build rates for the total automotive industry. Finally, growth in our automotive aftermarket business was softer than we anticipated going into the year. Looking at our entire company's performance from a geographical perspective, we continue to capitalize on opportunities in developing markets. In Q1, we posted 7% growth in developing markets, including double-digit growth in China, along with strong growth in India, Southeast Asia and Brazil. Turning to margins. Our team expanded margins to a healthy 23% with 4 of our 5 business groups at 23% or higher. We also continued to build for the future, including investing 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And as a reminder, we increased our Q1 dividend by 16%, which marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. In summary, we delivered good growth in the quarter throughout much of the portfolio while a few markets were softer than we anticipated going into the year. As a result, today, we're adjusting the top end of our full year guidance for organic growth and earnings per share. We expect organic growth of 3% to 4% versus 3% to 5% previously, along with EPS of $10.20 to $10.55 against the prior range of $10.20 to $10.70. Going forward, we remain confident in our ability to keep generating premium value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. We will continue to execute the 3M playbook and strengthen our competitiveness and are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who would take you through the details. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Let me begin with two topics that impacted GAAP earnings in the first quarter that Bruce touched on at the beginning of the call. Recall that following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded a provisional tax expense in Q4. As expected, the IRS has issued subsequent guidance resulting in updates to these amounts. As a result, we booked an additional tax expense of $270 million or $0.36 per share in the first quarter. We expect further IRS updates throughout the year. Also, we incurred an $897 million charge for the legal settlement which amounted to a $1.16 impact to earnings per share. This charge is reflected within Corporate and Unallocated. Excluding these impacts, first quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, an increase of 16% year-on-year. Please note that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of both items on 2018 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review first quarter sales. Sales growth in the first quarter was 2.8% organically. Selling prices increased 70 basis points in the first quarter. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 90 basis points and were positive across all geographic areas. This marks our strongest underlying price performance in several years. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 70 basis points to growth in the quarter. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.2 percentage points. All in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.7% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 2.3% with selling prices up 80 basis points. Growth was led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer. EMEA was flat in Q1 with West Europe down 1%. Asia Pacific delivered mid-single-digit organic growth, led by Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Organic growth was 11% in China/Hong Kong. Japan was flat or up 3%, excluding electronics. Finally, Q1 organic growth in Latin America/Canada was 3.5%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada and Brazil delivered organic growth of 5%, while Mexico was up 3%. Please turn to Slide 7 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.3 billion with operating income of $1.9 billion, up 9.3%. First quarter operating margins were 23%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Leverage on organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year performance and footprint actions contributed a combined 120 basis points to margins. Acquisitions net of divestitures reduced margins by 40 basis points. Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 10 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points, and higher retirement benefit cost decreased operating margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings-per-share. First quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, up 16% year-over-year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.17 to per share earnings in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging added $0.05 a share. Other expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share due to higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement expense. Our underlying Q1 tax rate was 17.6%, in line with our expectations, which increased earnings by $0.18 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by tax reform and continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was a minus $161 million, impacted by the legal settlement that I referred to earlier. The net impact from the legal settlement and tax reform adjustment decreased free cash flow conversion by 72 percentage points. First quarter capital expenditures were $304 million, up $17 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 16%, resulting in $810 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $937 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. With this in mind, we are increasing our full year range to $3 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $5 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial Business Group delivered first quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 2.2% organically. Within Industrial, growth was led by abrasives, up mid-single digits, and industrial adhesives and tapes, up 3%. Our automotive OEM business was up over 3%, outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds by over 400 basis points. In automotive aftermarket, we saw good growth in our products and solutions for retail car care, which was more than offset by softer demand from auto body shops. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, followed by a low single-digit growth in both Latin America/Canada and the United States. Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $719 million, up 7.3%, with an operating margin of 22.9%. Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter Safety and Graphics sales were up 6.9% organically to $1.8 billion with growth across all businesses and geographies. Our Personal Safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. This business continues to see strong global demand for our personal protective equipment across all end markets. The commercial solutions and roofing granules businesses were both up mid-single digits. Transportation safety also posted positive growth, driven by our core sheeting and pavement marking segments. In addition, this business recently won contracts with the State of California to upgrade their infrastructure and enable the roadway of the future. Geographically, organic growth was led by high single-digit increases in both Asia Pacific and the U.S. with mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada. Operating income was $483 million and operating margins of 27.1%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 2.7% organically. Growth was led by a high single-digit increase in both food safety and health information systems. Our medical consumables business, which represents the largest segment within Health Care, posted mid-single-digit growth in Q1. Oral care was flat with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing economies, offset by softness in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way, up 8%, followed by 5% growth in Latin America/Canada. We saw continued strength in developing markets, which were up 10% in the quarter, led by China/Hong Kong and Brazil. Health Care's first quarter operating income increased 7% to $460 million, and operating margins were nearly 30%. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 1.7% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 3% organically, including low double-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Growth continues to be very strong in semiconductor manufacturing and data centers, with robust demand for cooling fluids and interconnect solutions. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in display materials and systems due to softness in consumer electronics. Our energy-related businesses were down low single digits organically with electrical markets flat and telecommunications down. Please note, we continue to expect to close on the sale of our telecommunications business later this year. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 4% increase in Asia Pacific. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $337 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Please turn to Slide 14. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion and organic growth was 2.1% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew high single digits organically, building on its track record of strong performance over the past several years. Home care also delivered positive growth in the quarter while consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. followed by 3% growth in Latin America/Canada. We continue to invest and expand our category-leading brands, such as Filtrete and Post-it. During Q1, we launched the first-ever Bluetooth-enabled Filtrete Smart Air Filter. We also launched Post-it Extreme Notes, which are designed to hold to rough surfaces even in challenging conditions. Finally, operating income was $218 million with operating margins at 19.3%. Operating margins were impacted by year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions, along with the investments associated with the new product launches I previously mentioned. For the year, we expect margins to be in the low 20s, similar to 2017. That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15, and I'll review our updated 2018 guidance. As Inge summarized in his opening remarks, we are updating our full year organic growth expectation to a range of 3% to 4% versus previous guidance of 3% to 5%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.55 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.70. Our full-year expectations for return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion remain unchanged. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Is this Inge's last call that he's hosting before he becomes Chairman, the special new job thingie? Inge Thulin : No, it's not. I would be in July as well, and I own the next quarter as well, so I'm not going away. Scott Davis : Well, good. Well, we're glad to keep you or have you still around. But anyways, I've got 2 questions and one just on the business and one really on succession. But first, on the business, electronics, is price decelerating in electronics? Is there some sort of change in supply dynamic or supply-demand dynamic? Or is it on the same, really, curve that's been on now for several years? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Scott. What seeing in price in the Electronics and Energy business, I'd say there's no discernible trend of it getting better or worse. It's typically a slight decline in price as we compete on the electronics side of the business. We've been seeing that and we continue to expect that going forward, but not a trend of it accelerating down nor accelerating up. It's pretty constant, Scott. Scott Davis : Right. And just as a follow-on, I mean, what -- Inge, what has Mike Roman been working on? I mean, what's the focus? Any early read on CEO transition of what might change or difference? Inge Thulin : Yes, Mike is here, so he will give some comments around that. But yes, a couple of comments. The transition is going very well. Mike, first of all, we have worked together for many years, as you know. First time we worked together was back in Europe early 2000, so I think 2003 and so. And then Mike was also working with me on the strategies that were laid out in 2012 and 2013. And currently, we talk every day. I feel like we text every hour and are totally aligned to what needs to be done. But he's here, so he should make some comments relative to his initial thought and so forth. But most importantly, he is very much focused on delivering Q2 together with all of us and of course, also what we did in Q1. So Mike, if you like to add some comment on... Michael Roman : Yes. Scott, that's where I would start to. I'm focused on delivering 2018 starting with Q2 now. So over those 15 years, I really enjoyed working with Inge. Especially the last six years, I've been proud to be part of his leadership team that has helped advance the company. And I -- we've accomplished a lot under his leadership. And so I would say what I focus on is the things that we've been building and really, where we have a lot of similarities, and our focus is on our playbook. And the commitment to that playbook, including the opportunities we have in Portfolio Management and the innovation in Business Transformation as we move ahead. So that's where the focus is right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker : Just wanted to make sure I understood the reduction at the high end of guidance. Is that whole $0.15 just sort of high incrementals on the 1% reduction at the high end? Michael Roman : Yes, Steve. The EPS change in guidance really is a result of what we're doing on the adjustment to our outlook for organic growth and really making that adjustment from 3% to 5% to 3% to 4% and doing that, really focused on those businesses and markets where we saw some of the specific market softness as we came through Q1. Steven Winoker : Okay. And that market softness mostly -- in this discussion, what I heard, sounds like -- maybe a little more clarity around Western Europe, what's going on there in terms of what you're seeing on the short cycle side. Michael Roman : Yes. If you look at West Europe, organic growth came in as expected. And I would say -- come back to what we talked about in the past, that we're taking portfolio and footprint actions in West Europe to improve our growth in margins. And we're going to continue to do that. It's our part of our plan and our focus on delivering on that 20% income margin by 2020, and so that's built in. We still see West Europe tracking with our expectations to be low single digits. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then in that case, just broadly speaking, the weakest organic growth on the short cycle basis that you saw globally, can you just nail that down for us? Michael Roman : Well, I think we called out several specific markets. So automotive aftermarket, oral care and I would say, our consumer electronics is tracking as we expected as we come into the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can we maybe talk on the organic growth guidance, the step-down to 3% to 4%.? We spent some time together in March. It still seems like the higher end of the range was going to be achievable for the year. So I'm just wondering, if -- from a near-term perspective, have things changed at all? Have things gotten off to a little bit of a slower start than originally expected in April? Michael Roman : Joe, I would tell you, back to March, we started to see the softness in Q1 coming through as we went through the month and we signaled that. And it was -- even at that point, it was specific to the market segments that we called out, and those played out as we thought they would through March. If you look at April, April is starting in line with our expectations. And so I think that the adjustment to the range was really looking to those specific markets that we saw coming through Q1, and we expect to see some improvement in a couple of those areas, but it's really -- that's what's driving the adjustment. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. If I were to maybe just touch on price costs for just a second. So clearly, pricing is coming through a little bit better than expected. But also, from a cost inflation standpoint, it seems like it's a little bit more difficult this year to try to offset with substitute products. Maybe just an update on the expectations for the year for both pricing and also on the cost inflation side. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Joe. You're picking up on those two points accurately. We see ourselves as off to a good start with our selling prices with it up 70 basis points and positive across all geographies. And for the year, we expect price growth to remain strong and that it will more than offset raw material inflation. But to that end, on raw material inflation, we are seeing more -- some increases in raw material prices. In fact, more than what we originally estimated when we gave the guidance back in December is particularly around crude derivatives and transportation and logistics expenses. For the year, we're still expecting our stronger price growth to more than offset the raw materials. And if you think back to the guidance that we set out for raw materials, and this may answer a little bit of Steve's earlier question too, we started the year expecting raw materials, commodity prices to be about a push, somewhere between a $0.05 benefit to a $0.05 headwind, depending on -- net of the projects that we do to offset that. Right now, we see that's somewhere between a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. So that's part of what we're seeing impacting our earnings for the year. But that's being more than offset by the higher pricing that we're now also expecting for the year. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful, Nick. Maybe just one clarification there, there's a new like kind of $0.05 to $0.10 range from a headwind perspective. Does that include the increased freight cost as well? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, it does. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan Securities. Charles Tusa : So could you give us maybe a little bit of color on how the -- how we're going to trend kind of over the course of the year from a growth perspective? I know that you had the Easter timing here in the first quarter you had called out before. How does that play into the second quarter? And then how do we -- is there any lumpiness or volatility in growth in the second half as well around the third and the fourth quarter, just high level? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Steve, as I look out over the rest of the year, April, we're seeing off to a strong and expected start for us. So as I look at the 3 remaining quarters of the year, I don't really see any discernible trend difference amongst those 3. All of them coming in, in line now with our expected 3% to 4% organic growth for the year. I don't really see any lumpiness there. Charles Tusa : Okay. Is there anything that you think abnormally impacted the seasonality in the first quarter here? Maybe your -- I mean, the price costs are still kind of neutral-ish, so I wouldn't think it would be price cost. But anything in the quarter here that depresses the result from a seasonal perspective? Nicholas Gangestad : Other than the one thing we mentioned with the timing of Easter, that's -- as far as anything else seasonal, I don't think we see anything like that, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : So in Health Care, growth has been soft over the last couple of quarters, but maybe a little below expectations. You mentioned oral care, obviously, has been -- it was flat, a little weaker than the last couple of quarters. You did seem to outperform in oral care last year, but kind of improved this year. What could get better in Health Care to reaccelerate as the year goes on? We know your long-term expectations for Health Care growth are above the high 2% range that you reported in the quarter. Michael Roman : Yes. Thank you, Andy. You look at Health Care, we had good growth in our medical consumables business, our food safety, our health information systems businesses, and we expect that trend to continue as we go through the year. Oral care was flat. We did see good growth internationally, especially in developing economies, but that was offset by some softness in the U.S. So if you look at that playing out, we expect to see some improvement there. But that is what's pulling down the organic growth in the first quarter. And we also -- our drug delivery business, as you know, was a project-based business and that can be up and down quarter-to-quarter and we saw Q1 down year-on-year against a strong comp that we had last year. So those -- was maybe more of a first quarter issue, but oral care flat was the real focus. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And then maybe just shifting to Industrial. There, you did have a relatively strong momentum in the second half of the year. You talked auto aftermarket [indiscernible]. What's interesting obviously is you also mentioned last -- whether  you're pulling that on rebates in Industrial. And obviously, you've had good pricing growth. Do you think that's had anything to do with sort of the slowing in Industrial, having maybe overpriced at all in Industrial? And how do you look at it sort of going forward? Michael Roman : Yes. As you heard, we had good growth in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes and in auto OEM over build rates. And all of those were part of that price performance as well. So I think that's a broad part of our portfolio, and that didn't see any volume fall off because of price. In automotive aftermarket, which was the decline in Q1, we saw strong growth in our products and solutions for retail. Car care was really the declines in auto body, and so it was a very specific market. And we saw no indications of a pull-in ahead of any price increases and really no changes. It was just a soft market for us as we went through that quarter. So it was really that. So I think we continue to see strong growth across the broader industrial portfolio. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And you don't think it's share loss or anything like that in auto aftermarket? Michael Roman : No, we don't see any indication of that at all, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Robert McCarthy : I think following up on Andy's line of questioning. Obviously, you got some decent price to the U.S. Definitely, 1Q, I think, was up slight -- '18, plus 80 basis points there. But you did see some weakness, I mean -- and if you think about your overall kind of formula for leveraging global IPI and having some decent strength in the U.S., do you think it's fair to say you under indexed the U.S.? And don't you think it raises some questions at maybe some parts of your product portfolio, you might be facing some level of commoditization in Consumer and some consumer health care? And how do you react to that aside from probably defiance? Michael Roman : So Rob, again, I go back to -- we do see broad growth relative to those markets and overall economic backdrop. And so I think it's really isolated to specific market segments, and that's what we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And it's really been -- when you look broadly across the portfolio in the U.S., it's automotive aftermarkets, it's oral care and it's a couple of project-based businesses. We have some year-over-year comps with a couple of project-based businesses. Those are not price value kinds of changes. Robert McCarthy : And then just maybe coming out a different way. Obviously, your gross margin contracted year-over-year by about 60 basis points. Is there any kind of narrative there you can kind of give us in terms of mix, price costs? What's going on there that's become the main driver if you look at Slide 19 in terms of your Q on a -- P&L on a consolidated basis? Nicholas Gangestad : Rob, one of the bigger things in there that you may not be seeing visibility to is what FX is doing to our gross margin. Clearly, we get some benefit to our earnings per share from a weaker U.S. dollar, but that's partially offset by our hedging strategy that offsets some of our risk from FX. All of those hedging losses become part of our cost of goods sold. And that brought down gross margin in 20 -- in the first quarter of 2018 as well as bringing down operating margin by 40 basis points. Robert McCarthy : Should we think about that currency translation drop through kind of like low teens, like a 10% drop through by definition of the rolling of the hedges and structurally? Or how do we think about the incremental margin coming from FX growth? Nicholas Gangestad : The incremental margin, Rob, I haven't quite thought of it in that direction. Generally, what... Robert McCarthy : Sorry, the drop through from FX to the bottom line. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, it will vary depending where we are in the cycle with FX movements. Right now, we're at a point where we're going against a comp a year ago where we were having hedging gains. Now we're having hedging losses with the weaker U.S. dollar. So I can't put out one metric like that because it will vary quarter-to-quarter. Robert McCarthy : Well, like traffic and oversimplification. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just in terms of geographies, the China strength was impressive, up double digits. Maybe give us a context about the end market drivers or the product drivers there. And part of the issue here, maybe this is just an overhang with all the headline news about trade war and protectionism and so forth, is that if things came to a boil, any boycott of American brands would likely put 3M at risk. And have you given any consideration to that potential development? Michael Roman : So Deane, I would say we saw broad-based growth in China, as you heard. And it was led again by our domestic-facing businesses, talked a bit about the trend here and how we're taking advantage of that. So health care, personal safety, some of the domestic-facing parts of our industrial businesses, industrial adhesives and tapes was a strong grower. We also are seeing continued strength in some key trends that are -- we're really taking advantage over their innovations, so air quality, water quality, food safety. And as we start the year, electronics has been in line with the broader China growth. So broad-based growth, led with that broader portfolio in the domestic businesses. When you look at the contingency plans for all the things that we can face in a particular market, that part of it is our broader portfolio and how we think about it with our different customer set. But I -- right now, we see we're well positioned with the China markets and the China customers to be in a good position, whatever the outcome is for -- or the outlook is for the economy there. Nicholas Gangestad : Deane, this is Nick. Deane, I'll just add one thing. I think you're aware, our strategy in China has been we are putting local manufacturing there that we manufacture within China for our Chinese customers. And that's -- we think that's one other layer of protection we have in our strategy as we execute that in China. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, we see that the increase in buybacks announced today -- what's the expectation in terms of adding leverage? Beginning of the year, expected a range of $1.5 billion to $4 billion being added. Where do you expect to be on that range and what kind of timing? Nicholas Gangestad : Deane, I'm not updating the expected range on leverage. I would say M&A is the biggest variable on what that -- where we'll end up with added leverage, and that's difficult to estimate the timing of that. The range we're seeing right now is our best estimate, the one we communicated in December. This adjustment in share buyback level doesn't impact our total estimated leverage that we expect to add for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question on the sort of productivity aspect of the earnings or EPS road map that you laid out previously. If I look at that, you had maybe $0.60 or so in aggregate coming from portfolio and footprint, business transformation and then productivity. So I just wondered, in light of the raw material headwinds and also the shortfall on organic volume growth, if there was any increased urgency around extracting higher savings from productivity this year, whether just pulling some forward or increasing the amount for the year as a whole. Nicholas Gangestad : Julian, for the year, we're -- we still estimate our productivity level at how we originally estimated that in December. Looking at first quarter with our margins and the underlying productivity, our margins at 23%, underlying productivity was positive. But for the year, we expect that to improve going forward. Our lower volumes in the first quarter, we think, were one of the factors causing productivity to be slightly lower than what we're estimating for the total year. And as the year goes on, we're confident that we'll have productivity in the levels we estimated in December. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around the Electronics and Energy segment. Just trying to understand, you had guided obviously sort of a slowdown there back at the end of 2017. We did see that slowdown very clearly manifest itself in Q1. So as you look at the balance of the year, is there a sense that, that may start to accelerate from that Q1 low base as you move through 2018? Or you think that the current growth rate is representative of the year? Michael Roman : Yes. So I would say, Julian, that outlook, as we laid it out at the beginning of the year, it's playing out pretty much in line with that when you look at consumer electronics. We had strong growth in data centers and semiconductor markets, and we see robust demand for our products, our fluids solutions, our interconnect solutions in those markets. And that's offset by that, consumer electronics and the demand we see in those markets. And it -- but that's playing out as expected. And so we're right in our range for what we thought we would be doing as we come through the year. Inge Thulin : This is Inge. One more comment, yes, around that business group because I think it's important when you talk about volume going forward and so forth. You have to remind yourself and we have to remind ourself the work that's been done relative to the portfolio. So if you go back many years ago -- now if we had tougher growth rate moving forward, we were really challenged on the margin side. And you can see now, quarter after quarter after quarter, and now a couple of years, that the structure is right and the relevance for the market is correct for us. So the margins is now very positive for us and on a high end even for the enterprise and it's sustainable as we move ahead. And I think that's the important element of that business as part of 3M. We manage that now very, very well despite some up and downs in volumes where -- because we know there is some business there that is more volatile, right? But I think the portfolio work now has put us in a place where we feel very, very good quarter-by-quarter in order to be able to deliver the return to you. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just on that point, would you characterize the sell in and the sell-through in electronics just being in good balance right now if there's any inventory? Inge Thulin : Yes, it does. Yes, no increase, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Two quick ones. Your comments were sprinkled with various end markets or various product lines that touch on construction. Is the traction that you're seeing there, better spending or more -- an increase in spending by your customers? Or is it an innovation cycle on your side? And secondly, with respect to the litigation settlement, can you update us on where you are, what is outstanding, what you see is a time line, if there are any issues to draw before we could reasonably expect to hear the use of shoes, however small, dropping? Michael Roman : Yes. So Laurence, on the construction side, so we continue to see strong growth from our home improvement business out of our Consumer Business Group, and that is -- a big part of that is the construction, the growth we see in construction. And the businesses that buy through that channel is -- has been increasing and is being a big, important part of that channel. It's a mix of strong growth in that markets as well as the products that we are bringing to them. I -- we put a lot of innovation into that part of the -- our portfolio, have expanded it and we position ourselves well for the growth that's coming in that end market. So Laurence, just on your second question, back to your second question, on the follow-up to the NRD settlement. We are the process of implementing the grant to the state, and we're working closely with the State of Minnesota, as expected. We are -- we think we've got focus there and well positioned as we move ahead. Laurence Alexander : But I guess, maybe just to clarify, is that a precedent for other states? Or does it rule out any similar issues in other states? I mean, just -- there's been a lot of media mudslinging around different scenarios, most of which we're seeing highly improbable. But maybe if you can just give your perspective on that. Michael Roman : No, this is a unique situation. This is our home state and something that we've been working on with them for a number of years. So this is a unique situation in both the nature of the case as well as the grant and the process that we're working through with them. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just two quick ones for me, if I could. Just back to the consumer question. It is kind of interesting or perhaps concerning, the -- some of the anecdotes you shared there. Do you see in your results potentially kind of a cracking in U.S. consumer strength that perhaps is not readily apparent yet from a macroeconomic standpoint? Or do you actually think it is just some timing noise and other idiosyncratic things going on in a couple of these channels? Michael Roman : Yes. Jeff, as you look at the U.S., that was actually one of the strengths of our consumer business as we came through Q1. We saw stronger growth there. And as we talked about, it was led by home improvement, but our home care business was also positive. We continue to see some slight declines in our office channel, but it was broad based, stronger growth in the U.S. market. So no, very much in line with improvements in low GDP and outlook for retail spending. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just very specifically on dental, oral care, it's just kind of been a slog for you and Danaher and others, all these kind of distribution changes and things going on. Do you see any opportunity there that change the business model, perhaps go direct, not go through these various distribution channels? Are you doing anything proactive there to maybe kind of reshape, reposition that business in any way? Michael Roman : It's interesting. The channel for oral care has become more efficient over time. They really changed how they manage it. You see that in maybe our balance in the channel and how our sell in and sellout is balanced in the channel. So we continue to work with, I would say, the changes that -- kind of the constant change that's going on in our commerce channels more broadly. We see that across many of our businesses, oral care included. So I think that's -- our focus always is creating new models to serve our customers. We're focused on those end use customers and we work with our channel partners through their changes and really through new models that come as well. So we're focused on a broad range of strategies there in oral care and beyond. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments. Inge Thulin : Thank you. As I look at our first quarter performance, there are many positives, broad-based growth across all business groups, which included strong pricing, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Equally important, we continue to evolve and build out our enterprise for long-term success. 3M is strong and we have the experience, market position and capabilities to continue delivering sustained profitable growth in 2018 and well into the future. Thank you for listening, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Inge Thulin : Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As you all are aware, Q2 was my last quarter as the CEO and I have now moved on to my new role as Executive Chairman of the 3M Board. Mike Roman is our new CEO and I am pleased with the orderly transition between me and Mike, which we have worked on for the last year. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Mike and our CFO, Nick Gangestad, and you will see that once again we had a very strong quarter with robust organic growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, and good cash flow. But before doing that, I would like to make a few comments. First, I would like to recognize all of you who have covered, analyzed, and invested in 3M. I have enjoyed our many interactions and I have always appreciated your input along with your integrity and professionalism. I would also like to thank all of our 91,000 3Mers around the world for your contributions and support. Working together, I am pleased at what we have accomplished over the last six years. We enhanced and focused our portfolio and as a result, today, we are far more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. We have strengthed our innovation engine and improved our cost structure and began to transform 3M for the future. We have reached for our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life. All of this is reflected in our financial results and in the premium value we have created for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. At the same time, I am equally confident in our future. The Board of Directors and I have no doubt that Mike is the right person to lead our Company as CEO and continue building strengths on strengths. As I look across our enterprise, it\u2019s clear that we have the leadership, market position, and capabilities to continue to build on the fundamental strength of 3M. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for summary of our second quarter. Mike? Mike Roman : Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am honored to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of this incredible enterprise and lead our team into the future. I would like to express my gratitude to Inge for his vision, leadership, and ongoing partnership in his new role as Executive Chairman. Over the last six years, we\u2019ve made great progress in building out the 3M playbook, which has created a tremendous foundation for us. Moving ahead, we are focused on continuing our momentum, generating extraordinary value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s review our second quarter results, starting on Slide 5. We had a strong quarter, highlighted by broad-based organic growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share, along with record sales and rising margins. Looking at the numbers, total sales were $8.4 billion, an all time high for 3M. We delivered strong organic growth of 6% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Please note that we have an upcoming ERP roll out in the United States, and in anticipation of that deployment, some of our customers decided to accelerate their purchases. We estimate that this added approximately 50 to 100 basis points of growth in the second quarter, all of it in the U.S. results. Moving on to earnings, we posted GAAP earnings of $3.07 per share, up 19% year-on-year. Adjusted earnings were $2.59 per share compared to $2.25 a year ago. This demonstrates that our teams around the world continue to execute well. Underlying margins were strong at 24% with all business groups above 21%. Beyond financial results, we are committed to building 3M for the long run, while returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $468 million in research and development and another $365 million in CapEx. We also returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including both dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 6. There is a lot to like this quarter across our entire portfolio. Our Industrial team posted good organic growth of 6%, a nice pick up from the first quarter. Growth was broad-based with particular strength in our filtration platform where we are leveraging our Membrana acquisition to accelerate penetration in biopharma and life sciences. Safety and Graphics delivered another outstanding quarter of 9% organic growth, along with robust margins. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our personal safety business grew double-digits, as we continue to build and extend our industry-leading portfolio in this market. In Health Care, we continued to expand worldwide with organic growth of 4%, led by our medical solutions business with mid-single-digit growth. Health Care also posted double-digit growth in developing markets, as investments in those areas are paying off. This is a great business for 3M and we will continue to invest to strengthen it for the future. Organic growth in Electronics and Energy was 5% on top of 10% growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. Within this business group, we have done a lot of portfolio work over the last several years to improve our relevance to customers in the marketplace. This has led to improved growth and a sustained improvement in margins. Last month, we continued to build on this portfolio work with the sale of our communication markets business. After a thorough review, we decided that selling this business will result in the greatest value creation for 3M and our shareholders. This is a good example of how we are actively managing our portfolio to best utilize the 3M model. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize high growth opportunities in Electronics and Energy, such as automotive electrification, data centers, and semiconductor fabrication. Finally, organic growth in Consumer was 4%, which included good performances across our leading brands. We saw continued strength in home improvement, along with a strong start to the back-to-school season. In summary, I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter and I thank our teams to their many contributions. Our playbook is working and we are just getting started. We are well positioned to grow into an even stronger and more successful company. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our portfolio, strengthen our innovation, and accelerate our transformation while developing our people. Nick will now take you through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. Sales grew 5.6% organically in the second quarter. Increases in selling prices contributed 110 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, and were positive across all geographic areas. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation increased sales by one percentage point. All-in second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.4% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 5.6%, led by electronics and energy, safety and graphics and consumer. EMEA increased 5.8% in Q2, driven by strong growth in West Europe that was led by Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Asia Pacific delivered 5.5% organic growth, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 12% in both China, Hong Kong, and India, while Japan was down 2%. Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America and Canada was 6%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada was up high single digits while Mexico and Brazil both delivered mid-single-digit organic growth. Please turn to Slide 8 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.4 billion. Operating income in the second quarter was $2.4 billion, which included $400 million benefit from the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Second quarter underlying operating margins were 24% excluding the net benefit from the communication markets divestitures. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Leverage on organic growth improved productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions contributed a combined 290 basis points to margins. Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 30 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 20 basis points. Lastly, during the second quarter, we settled several respiratory and oral care related lawsuits, which decreased margins by 70 basis points. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $3.07 per share, up 19% year-over-year. Underlying earnings were $2.59 per share when adjusting for the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Let me now discuss the primary drivers of the year-on-year increase in Q2 earnings per share. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions, added a combined $0.47 to per share earnings in the quarter. The previously mentioned legal settlements reduced Q2 earnings by $0.7 per share. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Our underlying Q2 tax rate was 19.8%, which increased earnings by $0.16 per share. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by U.S. tax reform and the continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise. Lastly, lower shares outstanding added $0.04 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 10 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 14.5% year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 83% in the quarter. This includes 16 percentage point headwind divestiture gain of the communication markets business and related actions. Second quarter capital expenditures were $365 million, up $63 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we paid $802 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of the year, we repurchased $2.5 billion of stock and now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus $3 billion to $5 billion previously. Let's now review our business group performance, starting with industrial on Slide 11. The Industrial business group delivered second quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based across all geographic areas and businesses. Our advanced materials, abrasives, and separation and purification business led the way with high single digit growth in the quarter. Looking at the rest of the Industrial portfolio, our industrial adhesives and tapes, auto and aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses, all delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 7% increase in EMEA, followed by mid-single-digit growth in each of the other areas. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $724 million. Operating margins were 23% with underlying margins up 180 basis points, excluding the impact of last year's second quarter portfolio and footprint actions. Please turn to Slide 12. Second quarter safety and graphics sales were $1.8 billion, up 8.5% organically with strong growth across all businesses and geographies. As Mike mentioned, our personal safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. The integration of our Scott Safety business is performing well and we are pleased with the performance of the business. Commercial solutions was up high single digits while the transportation safety and roofing granules businesses, were both up mid-single digits. Geographically, organic growth was led by 10% growth in EMEA with high single digit increases in both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Latin America and Canada grew 6% organically in the quarter. Operating income was $480 million with operating margins up 26.4%. Please turn to Slide 13. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 3.8% organically. Our medical solutions business, which is our largest segment in Health Care, grew mid-single digits in Q2. Oral care was up 3% with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing markets. Food safety grew high single digits, while health information systems grew mid-single digits. Finally, our project-based drug delivery business declined low single digits year-over-year. On a geographic basis, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and Canada lead the way, both up high single digits. EMEA grew 5% followed by 1% in the U.S. We saw continued strength in developing markets, up double digits led by China, Hong Kong growing in the high teens. Health Care's second quarter operating income increased 7% to $435 million. And underlying operating margins were just over 30%, adjusting for the impact of the legal settlement and the commercialization investments for our new Clarity aligners. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 14. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 5.2% in the second quarter. Sales were $1.3 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 4% organically, led by mid-single-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Our energy related businesses were up 9% organically led by electrical markets up double digits. As mentioned, we closed on the sale of substantially all of the communication markets business in the quarter and expect to close the remaining portion by the end of the year. On a geographic basis, the U.S led with high single-digit organic growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada was up low single digits. Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $865 million with underlying operating margins of nearly 28%. Please turn to Slide 15. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth was 4.3% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically, continuing its track record of strong performance. Our leading brands continue to win in the marketplace, particularly Command and Filtrete, both up double digits. The home care business and stationery and office supply business each delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. While consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer, geographically, growth was led by 7% increase in the U.S. followed by mid-single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada. In the second quarter, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our products in the U.S., particularly in the e-commerce channel. Finally, operating income was $261 million with operating margins of 21.4%. That wraps up our review of the second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 16, and I'll cover our updated 2018 guidance. Our full year organic growth expectations remain unchanged in the range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.45 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.55. The update to the range reflects the impact of the divested income associated with the communication markets business. Finally, please note that we now expect that foreign currency translation will add approximately 1% to full year sales growth versus the prior expectation of 2%. With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Inge, you will be missed. You did a fantastic job as you know, and Mike, big shoes to fill, but I'm sure you'll do great as well. There\u2019s one thing that caught my eye just in the prepared remarks was your ERP rollout comments. Can you tell us, is that in every segment? Is that -- how big of a deal is this and what\u2019s your confidence level that the pull forward was just 50 to 100 and not something greater than that? Is it possible to have that kind of precision? Inge Thulin : Scott, we\u2019ve been working on deploying our business transformation, our ERP rollout globally, for a number of years, and we have largely completed our deployment in Europe, West Europe, in particular. And now, as we came into 2018, we are focused on the U.S. And so it's a very well laid out plan of deployments by region, by business, by supply chain operations; and so we are over the next 18 months now deploying in the U.S., so we\u2019ve a very specific deployment by business. We did deploy our Health Care business at the end of last year. And so we have experience with that business in the deployment already complete, and now we\u2019re deploying the rest of the businesses in the U.S. as we go through the next 18 months. So we have a pretty clear view on which customers are impacted with the deployment at which periods of time, and so we have very good -- I think, pretty clear view of how much of the accelerated sales are in line with the deployment now that\u2019s taking place in the U.S. Scott Davis : And then as a follow-up, I mean we've seen some pretty big moves in EM currency over the last quarter. What can you guys -- what's the playbook? Do you have to go in there and raise prices? Do you realign some supply chains? I mean, what\u2019s the playbook to manage that volatility? Nick Gangestad : Scott, the playbook on there really isn't changing. We seek to have natural hedges against currency risk and how we set up the supply chain, and then we layer on top of that some financial hedges. And those financial hedges don't ultimately change the underlying financials over a longer period of time, but we have hedges that we enter into going out one, two, three years, to buy time for us to adjust our cost structure, our supply chain in order to end up with the competitive supply chain in a revised FX environment. So in the short term what we often do especially in emerging markets, we will adjust prices to partially offset the FX impact. And then we will adjust our supply chain adjusting where we\u2019re manufacturing based on FX movements. That tends to take a little longer time though, Scott. And not in a short-term, but we often have to change and re-qualify sources of supply to make that happen. For the year, Scott, I will say, we started the year guiding that FX with rates as they stood at the end of the year we thought that they would positively impact our earnings by about $0.10. Through the first few months of the year, the dollar weakened more and that pushed our EPS benefit that we were expecting slightly above that $0.10. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen the dollar strengthen, and we now see ourselves slightly below that $0.10. And through the first half of the year, we have seen $0.06 EPS benefit from FX. And if we see meaningful changes to that $0.10 we originally guided, we\u2019ll provide updates on that accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Inge, congratulations. Thanks, Mike. Look forward to working with you and the team. Just a question on guidance, if I look at income before taxes that you guys have on Slide 22, basically, I think prior outlook was 7.7 to 8.2, and now it\u2019s 7.8 to 7.9. And I think the press release indicates that most of it is just adjusting for missing revenue and earnings from the divestiture, but the composition sort of doesn\u2019t make sense. Can you tell us what the big moving pieces are as we move from 7.7, 8.2 range to 7.8 to 7.9. Nick Gangestad : Andrew, there\u2019s a few moving pieces there. First of all, as you noted, now that we have divested of our communications markets division, there is some income that that would have been generating in the last seven months of the year that that will no longer be generating, and that\u2019s what's encompassed in our adjustment to our EPS guidance for the year. In particular, what you're talking about there, there is also an impact from net interest expense. So in terms of our earnings bridge that we laid out at the beginning of the year, there is a couple of moving parts in addition to this communication markets adjustment that we announced today. First is, we are buying back more shares, and we originally guided that that would be $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit. We now see ourselves at the high end of that range, so that\u2019s on the positive. We also are borrowing more money, so our net interest expense is going up. So we started the year guiding that net interest expense would be a benefit to our EPS of $0.05 to $0.10. We now think that will be approximately flat for the year. Andrew Obin : So these are the two moving pieces, and just a question going back to the ERP question. I assume your guidance is sort of incorporated. Did you guys anticipate this pre-buy in the second quarter? And the second, just how do you guys think about managing disruptions from ERP implementations in North America because Western Europe, and I do appreciate that Western Europe was a much more significant undertake in terms of shutting down facilities, moving stuff around, but you did have negative top line comps there for a while. So going to the second half, as you have to manage ERP disruptions in North America, what gives you confidence that there will not be hits to organic growth? How you guys are going to manage it? Mike Roman : I would maybe start with, as we\u2019ve talked a lot about with the business transformation, it really starts and ends with the customer for us. So we are -- in our deployments, that's where we start. We focus on how to do the best for our customers, minimize impact and provide benefits with where we\u2019re going with business transformation. And I would say, as we deployed in Europe that was true. You are asking the customers to significantly change how they interact with us. But on the other side of that, change process is a lot of benefit for how we work together. And so I think we saw that in Europe. And we had the deployment and some of the same things we\u2019re seeing now in the U.S. where we had some repurchases. I don't think we would characterize it the way you did that we saw growth impacted by that business transformation. That was other dynamics in the marketplace and even some of things that we\u2019re doing around portfolio. So -- and maybe to a degree some of the things we\u2019re doing about some of the strategic investments there. But the layout with a focus on customers and how we manage that, that's part of what we're doing in the U.S. now. We\u2019re engaging day-in and day-out, communicating with them earlier about how this is progressing, working with them very closely about managing through any disruption as we scale down the legacy systems and scale up the new ERP and surrounding capabilities. And so that process, we are managing supply all the way through the calendar of those steps and this accelerated by -- we expected some accelerated by, we\u2019re working with our customers as we got closer, how much interruption would they see, how much accelerated buy made sense if -- and its really up to them. Ultimately, they\u2019re making the decision on what they buy based on the information we\u2019re communicating with them. I would say, it\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve deployed through West Europe and I think it's projecting that. We\u2019re doing good job, the deployments are on track and progressing well. Andrew Obin : So from your perspective, there is high degree of visibility on organic growth in second half? Mike Roman : Yes, related to the ERP deployment, absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : So there\u2019s obviously been a little more noise here with the ERP rollout. But can you give us a little more color and how should we think about your organic sales growth guidance by segment. If we look at your annual guidance and you guys talked about Health Care, at 4 to 6, maybe you\u2019re trending a little below there, but Safety and Graphics is trending way above. So is there a bit of trade-off there? And then the other segments generally in line for the year. Is that how we should think about it? Nick Gangestad : Just a few things, as far as the impact of this ERP go-live impact and the way its impacting different segments in the U.S. We see these impacts primarily in our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy business groups. It\u2019s not really having a material impact on consumer and really no impact on our healthcare business. So in terms of how you think about that impact in the second quarter and the third quarter, and fourth quarter it's really those three businesses that were impacted. Now in terms of our guidance for the year, we continue to see industrial globally -- we had originally guided 3% to 5%, we see that most likely in the bottom half of that range. And that aligns with the updated total company guidance that we providing in April. We do see Health Care probably closer to the 4% growth for the total year and safety and graphics, which we\u2019d originally guided at 4% to 6%, we see at the high end or possibly higher than the high end of our original guidance. The others are Consumer and Electronics and Energy, we see those solidly in the ranges that we that we first put out. Andrew Kaplowitz : And maybe I could ask you about pricing, obviously, very strong pricing in the quarter. When you look at price versus raws, it actually accelerated or was better in Q2 than Q1. I know you said it was going to be an elevated year for pricing. But are there any particular end markets where pricing is particularly strong? And then do you think the headwind on price versus raw material cost could be less than the $0.05 to $0.10 for the year that you updated this time last quarter? Nick Gangestad : The $0.05 to $0.10, Andy, just to be clear, that\u2019s just the raw material headwind, that we updated that. And as far as price growth, it\u2019s actually, Andy, quite broad. I won\u2019t point out one business, or one geography, as really driving these results it's really quite broad and deep where the price growth is. In terms of impact on margin, I think I said earlier that we continue to see that positive for the year and halfway through the year. We continue to see that highly confident that our price increases will more than offset whatever we see for raw material headwinds for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : In terms of -- maybe first question on the top of the end market. Any updated thoughts on the automotive outlook, particularly in your Industrial business? And also within Electronics and Energy, there had been this bifurcation earlier in the year where device sell-through was soft but the CapEx or electronics materials business was very strong. Just wondered how you\u2019ve seen that playing out more recently. And are you worried about the CapEx portion or EMS decelerating given what's happening with the device sell-through? Mike Roman : So starting with the automotive, we continued, as year-to-date through the first half, we continue to see strong growth relative to the build rates globally. So remember we\u2019re managing a global automotive business, focus around key account relationships with the OEMs globally. And we\u2019re seeing continued good performance on our spec-ins and penetration into the marketplace and so good growth, year-to-date relative to the build rates. Some improvement in the build rates in second quarter still looking at IHS projections, up over 4%, slightly over 4% second quarter; again, total year still in line with that, 2.2% number; and always watching quarter-to-quarter the ups and downs there; but are performing well; and when you bring together our automotive electrification capabilities and what we're doing in our technology and applications around that, we continue to see a very robust outlook for outgrowing the build rates. If you turn to Electronics and Energy, we continue to see, I would say, strong growth in what we've been talking about as high growth electronic segments, around automotive electrification, around data centers, semiconductor fabrication, that continues to move forward; and semiconductor fabrication behind, as part of your question there where CapEx is being spent, still seeing significant growth opportunities for us. The rest of the electronics, I would say, electronics in general is playing out in line with the way we laid it out at the beginning of the year that was the more, I would say, modest growth in the consumer electronics part of our portfolio and stronger growth in those higher growth segments. There is some, I would say, some shifts here or there in the quarter but pretty much playing out as we expected in our Electronics and Energy business, pretty much right down the middle of the range that we laid out at the beginning of the year as well. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question would just be around, if you look back your EPS road map from Slide 8, way back at the December outlook meeting from Nick\u2019s presentation. I think you\u2019ve given the very thorough update on two of the laying chunks in that, so maybe any thought on the productivity piece. How that's trending in terms of footprint optimization, business transformation and the manufacturing productivity? In terms of -- I guess, what are the savings -- how the savings from those various programs tracking in the first half versus what you would expected? And any gyrations in the sales line causing you to accelerate some of the productivity plans? Nick Gangestad : Julian, in terms of the 2018 roadmap that I provided last December and then we updated it in January after tax reform, the other components are staying where we expected. But let me give a little color on it. Even organic growth, with the roll-down that we had in our total year organic growth expectation for the year, we see more of our growth coming from price, which is accretive to EPS. So our organic growth impact on earnings remains unchanged; footprint optimization, much of that, Julian, was just not repeating the charges that we took in 2017. There\u2019s some incremental charges and some benefit, those largely washed in 2018. We\u2019re expecting the majority of true benefit to be coming in 2019 and 2020. So that is progressing exactly as we expected. Raw materials, as I noted, we adjusted that down from that original guidance. Business transformation and productivity, both of those are tracking to the range that we put in that they\u2019re performing exactly as we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : I\u2019d like to follow up on some of the business line specific questions that Julian started there. And Mike, can you address how auto aftermarket did in the quarter versus some of the follow up we saw in the first quarter? And then in oral care, we saw the total growth. How did the U.S. market do specifically, has the distribution channel calm down and maybe talk a bit more about this launch. It looks that like Clarity will compete directly with Invisalign. And is that -- what are the competitive dynamics there? Mike Roman : So starting with the industrial, automotive aftermarket question, Industrial, we saw broad-based growth across all geographic areas of all businesses. We highlighted some of the leading growth there. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our automotive aftermarket business in Q2. Coming out of Q1, we\u2019re really looking hard at the market. We saw end demand soften as we came out of Q1, but the total year was projecting nominal growth for that marketplace. And we expected to improve as we went through the year, and we saw that starts in Q2. We saw the demand pick up. We saw our opportunity to marketplace pick up across developed economies, in particular, in the U.S. leading that. So we saw the improvement we expected with automotive aftermarket, and we\u2019re projecting the total year in line with where we started at the beginning. Turning to oral care, oral care is an important business for us. We\u2019re recognized as a leader in number of positions, leveraging our material science. And we continue to innovate and look to invest and grow this business as we move ahead. It really does leverage our strengths. If you look at the overall growth in second quarter; 3% for worldwide growth, down slightly in the U.S.; improving over Q1 and again, what we're expecting is to see some improvement globally; and led again by developing markets, but improving as we go through the year; still some room to go in improvement in the U.S. as we move ahead. We did announced and introduced our Clarity aligners at the American Association Orthodontist Show in May. And we believe that this now positions us to have the broadest set of solutions across orthodontic platforms, and we\u2019re actively onboarding orthodontist right now. So it\u2019s really a play for us to help -- have a broad-based suite of solutions for the orthodontists in the global market. We\u2019re getting -- so far getting very good and positive feedback. Deane Dray : And just as a follow up on tariffs, and maybe Nick can clarify the points that expect to be positive in price cost. Does that include the tariffs that have been announced and enacted? And what\u2019s the look forward on potential risk as this may get escalated? Nick Gangestad : The guidance that I said is inclusive of tariffs that have been enacted. So when we\u2019re talking tariffs there\u2019s a number of tariffs, first, the steel and aluminum under the national security act. And that impact as well as the Section 301 list 1, those two that have already been enacted, we see having a fairly immaterial impact on us. So we estimate that to be approximately $10 million, or a penny of share on an annualized basis, the direct and indirect impact of those tariffs. We are actively monitoring and assessing the potential impact from Section 301 list 2 and 3, if those were implemented and any potential retaliation that could occur with those. And we\u2019re prepared to act with sourcing changes, supply changes and pricing changes if enacted. So my initial statement stands that we think pricing will offset raw material impacts there and if tariffs expand we continue to see that happening. We\u2019re not quantifying the impact of those latter two since they haven\u2019t been enacted yet, but we are prepared with actions to minimize the impact of that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed. Laurence Alexander : Two quick ones, first, on the price versus raws dynamic. If raw material pressures peak out, do you think you can maintain the same pace of price, or is there certain amount of the price mix just the raw material offsets. And secondly on Asia, specifically in China, can you parse out a little bit the trends driving the pick-up in Chinese growth -- the acceleration from Q1 to Q2? Is that just Consumer and Health or is there something else going on there? Nick Gangestad : Laurence, on the price raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we\u2019re seeing there likely at a peak level. And our pricing projections, our selling price projections are consistent with that and that\u2019s part of our anticipation that in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we\u2019ll continue to have our prices -- our selling price increases more than offset what we\u2019re estimating now for commodity price increases. And we really don't see that changing. And if the commodity prices start to change again, we will be prepared to act. Mike Roman : And Laurence, just taking a look at China, we had strong growth in second quarter. Electronics performed very well as we continue to, I would say, win business with companies based there, including the China OEMs. We also saw strong growth in our domestic facing businesses, the domestic economy facing businesses. We\u2019ve had a strategy to prioritize growth here in line with what China is doing to develop their economy. And so as you noted, Health Care is a strong leader of that growth in the first half of the year, big part of our consumer business performing very well. Safety and Graphics also, really with the domestic facing portfolio, doing well. And even if you look at our Industrial business, we have platform businesses -- our Industrial business group that are performing well too and that would be a good example our industrial adhesives and tapes business doing very well in China. So it's broader than just Health Care and Consumer, really centered around where the growth is occurring in the broader China market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : The $0.15 probably mix of restructuring associated with the gain on the comms business. Is that just to the E&E comm segments or is this broader, and maybe just some color in terms of what actions you\u2019re taking with the $0.15? Nick Gangestad : Nigel, the actions that we\u2019re taking are to address stranded costs that are left after the divestiture of our CMD business. So there\u2019re addressing structural costs that this divestiture is leaving. We started those actions in Q2 and we expect to take more in the second half of the year to offset what could have been a negative impact if we had left those stranded costs in the company going forward. Nigel Coe : And would that be a payback, relatively quick payback, 12 month payback or little bit longer? Nick Gangestad : We expect that that will be paying back for us next year. Some of those actions will trail into next year in terms of when the cost saving start to happen. But we\u2019ll be starting to see that benefit in 2019. And Nigel, one other thing I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking this earlier, this charge is almost entirely been taken at a corporate level and not in our Electronics and Energy business. Nigel Coe : And then just a follow on question, on the guidance, the way the guidance set up at the second half. Are we getting questions in terms of still somewhat backend loaded, particularly when we think about the way the FX is coming through the P&L and if those comms comes at first half and second half. What\u2019s better in the second half versus the first half to get us to the midpoint of the guidance range> Nick Gangestad : For the second half of the year, we do expect that we\u2019ll be seeing more benefit from share repurchases than we saw in the first half. We do think productivity will be better in the second half than what we saw in the first half. And then in terms of commodity prices from a year-on-year basis, we expect that that will be fairly neutral between the first half and the second half. Pricing will likely be better in the second half than in the first half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Just a quick clean up from me on healthcare and then maybe a bigger picture question for Mike. Health Care U.S. growth has been a little on the soft side year-to-date and in the quarter, perhaps it's dental. But are we observing some hangover from pull forward on sales there from ERP last year in the healthcare business? Mike Roman : Jeff, healthcare in the U.S. where you\u2019re seeing the impact, broadly, we had strong growth and our medical solutions business is leading the way there. So maybe just a note about that too, we've been talking about this as our medical consumables business in the past, but it really is focused on value-based care and health economics. And it's a much -- in more integrated portfolio around that. So I\u2019m going to be talking about as medical solutions, so leading the way. We saw good growth in the U.S., also in food safety and health information. Oral care was down slightly. The bigger drag in second quarter was our drug delivery business. Again, we talked about project based business. We saw a decline in Q2 from that business and that was the bigger impact, so broad-based stronger growth that will position us well in the U.S. and as we move ahead. And then you asked\u2026 Jeff Sprague : And then, Mike, on the portfolio. Obviously, you\u2019ve been working closely with Inge all along. And I guess things will always be under review. But was CMD out of the way here now, do you view the portfolio as relatively stable, or there is more that you're working on internally and want to reevaluate? Mike Roman : If you look at where we are focused as we move ahead, our playbook is working. Our playbook is working, but there are opportunities that each of those three levers, including portfolio management. We are now an active portfolio manager and we do have a robust pipeline of how we look at our portfolio. And we\u2019ll be working to best utilize the 3M model and optimize the portfolio around our model for value creation. So we\u2019re going to continue to be an active portfolio manager as we move ahead. It's about prioritizing resources. It's about targeting where we go with M&A. And it's also about reviewing our businesses as we go. So I see that as very much part of our future value creation opportunity. And it's a priority for me as I step into the role. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : I just want to dig a little bit more into that important price point, the 1.1% in the quarter. You mentioned it was quite broad. But you usually also talk about splitting out currency impacts and other impacts versus underlying business year-on-year relative to taking pricing on existing items and new product, some time driving a big part of it. I am just trying to get a sense for the operating robustness of that number and the repeatability of it as we\u2019re looking through not only if implying the rest of the year, but later into next year too? Nick Gangestad : Steven, as I said, it\u2019s broad based; 100 basis points up in the U.S.; EMEA was up 180 basis points; Latin America and Canada 210 basis points; and A-Pac up 40 basis points. And that 110 basis points is inclusive of our electronics business, which is normally a price down model. If we pull electronics out, our underlying price growth was up 130 basis points. And as far as geographies and what we see as potential there, we continue to see -- we don\u2019t see that going down. Part of your question, Steve, was also on FX impact. Right now, we estimate there was only about 20 of that 110 or 130, depending on how you look at, price growth that was coming from FX. The vast majority of it is coming from core underlying price growth. And it's really a reflection of the value we create for our customers. And this is the new point I\u2019m making here. It\u2019s partially being driven by improvements in our global price management that our business transformation initiative is enabling. The ability to have better governance and better control over that pricing, we are starting to see that benefit and that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing change here. Steven Winoker : And Mike, Jeff just referred to it on the divestiture side and the portfolio change side. But looking at acquisition, Scott Safety was a great strategic play for you guys. What are you seeing in terms of think of the pipeline right now? Should we be expecting anything in the bigger size range soon, or are things on hold at all as you\u2019re going through the transition. What should the expectations be on the acquisitions? Mike Roman : For ne coming in, as always, organic growth remains our first priority. And so we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize investments in R&D, CapEx and product commercialization. With that in mind though in managing our portfolio, we\u2019re looking at M&A as an opportunity to create value, we\u2019re going to maintain the flexibility to pursue additional strategic acquisition opportunities like Scott Safety. And we have been, I think, very clearly focused on strategies that leverage our fundamental strengths unique value creators to 3M. Our ability to integrate successfully these acquisitions and to create market leadership positions like we've been doing in personal safety. So we are active. Our top priorities, as I look ahead our Health Care and Industrial, Safety and Graphics continues to be a priority, those are very much focused on integrating Scott Safety at this time. With that said, all five businesses are active. And we have strong overall pipelines for us to work with. And so for me it's about really moving ahead and identifying those opportunities that are clearly linked to those strategies where we can create differentiated value. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : So just better understanding some of the moving parts here, back to Nigel's question on the seasonality. You pulled forward a bit of sales here in the second quarter. You got pretty though comp in the third quarter. Anything on that comp that we should be aware of, is it like second half looks like first half whereas first quarter was lower than second quarter, a 3% range. Is that how we\u2019re thinking about the second half split between 3Q and Q4 on organic? And then also just on EPS, you had a low tax rate, tax rate low end of the range this quarter, maybe that steps up a little bit in the third quarter. Will you grow earnings here sequentially in the third quarter? Nick Gangestad : Steve, in terms of growth, let me give some guidance on how we're seeing growth between the third and fourth quarter. Mike talked earlier about the impact of our U.S. go-live with our ERP system and the amount of the revenue. So that impact as we expect that to be -- us to be giving back some of the sales in the second half of the year, we expect that to disproportionately impact the third quarter. And as you noted between the two quarters, Q3 is the tougher of the two comps between the third and the fourth quarter. That all-in, we are looking at the third quarter being lower growth than the fourth quarter, both of them aligned with our expectation of 3 to 4 for the total year. But I'm not going to be surprised if we have a lower number in third quarter, given what we're seeing so far for the year, and it\u2019s in line with our 3% to 4% guidance. And then in terms of EPS for each quarter, I\u2019ll try to avoid giving EPS guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we continue to see ourselves very firmly delivering in that 10 on an adjusted basis to 10.20 to the 10.45 for the total year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Aguilar of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Aguilar : So drug delivery down low single digits year-over-year, and I think last quarter was the same case of tough comps. Obviously, this is more project-based businesses as you guys said. And I remember in your Investor Day in 2016 you were talking about some of the advantages from drug delivery, like analytics and patient compliance. More long term, are you guys still optimistic about the future trends there generally with drug delivery? And can you give us an update about what you're excited about? Mike Roman : Josh, you\u2019re referring to some of the opportunities that we see for growth in that business. And we see opportunities to take that business to a positive growth business as we move ahead. It will continue to be a project-based business. So quarter-to-quarter, it can be lumpy and up and down but we do see opportunities. We have some unique capabilities and technology there that we imply as we move ahead. Operator : That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we had a strong performance in the second quarter, led by broad-based organic growth, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We are executing our playbook and are positioned to deliver successful 2018. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 23, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentations accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events found on Slide 2. First, we will be hosting our Investor Day at your headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota in a few weeks with a welcome reception in the evening of Wednesday, November 14th where we will be highlighting how 3M Science is advancing our priority markets for growth. Along with the formal presentation program, on Thursday November 15, the presentations will discuss our new five-year plan along with our preview of our 2019 outlook. If you plan to attend the event and have not yet responded, please RSVP right away. Second, our Q4 Earnings Conference call will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2019. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendices of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand out to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining us. In the third quarter 3M delivered a double-digit increase and cash flow and earnings per share along with strong margins despite slower growth. We also continue to execute on business transformation or deploying capital to invest in our future and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, our team posted total sales of $8.2 billion in the quarter. We delivered organic growth of 1% which is on top of 7% growth in last year's third quarter. As you recall from the discussion on our July earnings call, our ERP rollout in the US resulted in revenue shifting between Q2 and the second half of the year. Today, we estimate a pull forward into Q2 was approximately 100 basis points with the vast majority coming out of Q3. Moving on to earnings per share, we posted EPS of $2.58, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our company continues to deliver strong return on invested capital along with premium margins. Companywide we generated margins of 25% with all business groups above 22%. Our team also increased free cash flow by 24% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 114%. This is a testament to the strength of portfolio and business model, and our focus on driving productivity every day. We also continue to invest in R&D and capital to support organic growth while returning cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to 3M shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 5 for look at the performance of our business groups for both the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, three of our five business groups, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics posted organic growth of 2%. Healthcare and Consumer each had areas of strength, but also areas that were softer than expected. Healthcare's growth declined by 1% primarily due to continued weakness in our drug delivery business. Organic growth in Consumer was down 2%. This business group was impacted by channel adjustments between quarters with our major retail customers, though the sellout of our products remains strong. In his comments, Nick will provide more detail on third quarter performance of each business group. Given the shift of sales between quarters due to business transformation, it is also helpful to look at our performance through nine months. Safety and Graphics posted 6% growth followed by 3% growth from both Industrial and Electronics and Energy. Healthcare posted 2% growth with Consumer at 1%. Companywide, we have delivered organic growth of more than 3% year-to-date. I will come back to share our updated guidance after Nick takes us through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales grew 1.3% organically in the third quarter and are up 3.3% year-to-date. Increases in selling prices contributed 120 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, with positive price growth across all geographic areas. The net impact of acquisition and divestures contributed 20 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1.7 percentage points, all in third quarter sales in US dollars were down 20 basis points versus last year. In the US, organic growth was 0.5% with positive growth in Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Q3 organic growth was impacted by the deployment of our new ERP system in the US during the quarter. Year-to-date organic growth in the US is up 3%. Asia-Pacific delivered 3.2% organic growth led by Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 10% in China, Hong Kong, while Japan was down 7% or up 1% excluding our electronic related businesses. Year-to-date Asia Pacific is up 4.5% organically. EMEA declined 90 basis points in Q3 with West Europe down 25. From a year-to-date standpoint EMEA is up 2%. Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America, Canada was 2.1% led by Healthcare and Consumer. At a country level, organic growth in Brazil was 5%; Mexico was up 3% while Canada was flat. On a year-to-date basis, Latin America, Canada is up 4% organically. Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Companywide third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $2 billion. Third quarter operating income margins were 24.7%, up slightly versus last year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the third quarter. Organic volume, productivity and lower year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions added 70 basis points to margins. Selling price benefit more than offset raw material inflation which added a net 30 basis points to the third quarter margin. For 2018, we now expect full year raw material headwinds inclusive of tariff impacts of minus $0.15 per share versus a prior range of negative $0.05-$0.10 per share. We continue to expect benefits from selling price to more than offset raw material headwinds. Nearly offsetting these margin benefits during the quarter was a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency. A 30 basis point impact from acquisitions and 10 basis point headwind from the Q2 divestiture of the communications markets business. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, up 11% versus last year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.12 to per share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions added a $0.01 with a divested incoming and transition cost from the communications markets divestiture wherein earnings headwind of $0.03 per share. Foreign-currency net of hedging reduced per share earnings by $0.08 as the US dollar strengthened against many currencies throughout the quarter. For the full year, we now expect an earnings headwind from foreign-currency of minus $0.05 per share versus a prior estimated benefit of $0.10 or a reduction of $0.15 per share versus previous expectations. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. Our Q3 tax rate was 21.3% which increased earnings by $0.22 per share. This earnings benefit was primarily driven by the US Tax Reform. Lastly, a reduction in shares outstanding added $0.06 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we continue to generate strong operating cash flow allowing us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 24% year-on-year with a conversion rate of 114%. Third quarter capital expenditures were $377 million, up $52 million year-on-year, and we expect these investments to be approximately $1.6 billion for the year. In addition to investing in our businesses, we return significant cash to shareholders in Q3 including $794 million in dividends. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders to gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. Let's now review our business group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial business group delivered third quarter sales of $3 billion, up 2.2% organically with growth across all geographic areas. Our automotive OEM business continues to drive increased penetration across applications such as structural tapes, adhesives, and acoustics light weighting and electronics solutions. Overall, our business was up 5% in the quarter compared to global car and light truck builds which were down nearly 2%. The automotive aftermarket business declined low single-digit organically due to softness in the collision repair market. Our Industrial adhesives and tapes business and filtration were both up low single digits in the quarter. Finally, the Advanced Materials business led the way with double organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was led by a 3% increase in Asia Pacific followed by the US, up 2%. Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $667 million with operating margin of 22.1%. Please turn to Slide 11. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.7 billion, up 2.2% organically in Q3. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 5% organically on top of a 14% increase last year. The integration of Scott Safety is on track and the business continues to exceed our expectations. Transportation safety grew mid-single digits while Commercial Solutions was up low-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined mid teens as shingle manufacturers slowed production in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by 5% growth in Asia-Pacific. Operating income in the third quarter was $412 million while operating margins were 24.8%, which includes a 150 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety acquisition. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Healthcare business generated third quarter sales of $1.4 billion down 1.1% organically versus a 7% comp last year. Holding back both third quarter and full year organic growth in healthcare has been the continued softness in our drug delivery business, which is depended on pharmaceutical regulatory timelines and customer R&D budgets. This business saw a 25% year-over-year decline in Q3 organic growth, which negatively impacted overall healthcare organic growth by 250 basis points. While our drug delivery business is experiencing near-term challenges, the pipeline continuously to strengthen and we expect the business to stabilize in 2019. Oral care grew 2% organically with improved growth in the US and continued strength in developing markets. Our 3M Clarity Clear Tray Aligners launch is off to a good start as the number of new cases ramps quickly and we expect continued momentum going forward. Our Medical Solutions business declined slightly against a strong comp of 7% from a year ago. Through nine months this business was up 3% with particular strengths in vascular access and advanced wound care solutions. Food safety continues to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high-single digits while Health Information Systems grew mid-single digits. On a geographic basis Asia-Pacific led the way up 10% with Latin America, Canada up 4%. EMEA was down slightly while the US declined mid-single digits primarily due to last year's strong comp. Healthcare's third quarter operating income was $446 million and operating margins were nearly 31%. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 2.3% in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronic side of the business grew 1% led by a mid single digit increase in electronics materials solutions. This business continues to experience strong demand particularly in the semiconductor and datacenter market. In addition, we continue to see our content per mobile device grow globally as we apply 3M science to the advancement of this market. Our energy related businesses were up over 6% organically with strong growth in renewable energy and pipe coating solutions. On a geographic basis, the US was up 5% while both Asia Pacific and Latin America, Canada were up low single digits. Third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $457 million with operating margins of 31.7%. Please turn to Slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth declined 2% year-on-year. Our Home Improvement business grew low single digits organically, while the other three businesses each declined in the quarter. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Latin America, Canada. The US was down slightly impacted by our Q3 ERP rollout. We continue to see strong consumer demand for our products with mid single digit point to sale growth. EMEA declined mid single digit as we've been actively managing our product portfolio. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 7% as we've seen lower channel demand for our consumer respiratory solutions. Third quarter operating income was $291 million with operating margin of 23.5 %. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Mike to review our updated 2018 guidance. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Nick. With three quarters behind us, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now anticipate organic growth of approximately 3% versus a prior range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10 against the previous range of $10.20 to $10.45. Our change in EPS guidance is largely due to three factors; our updated growth expectations along with our updated guidance for currency and raw materials that Nick mentioned earlier. Looking at the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we know there's a lot more we can and will do to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Going forward, we are focused on driving growth being relentless and putting our customers first and continuing to transform 3M to deliver greater productivity. This means we will continue to work to optimize our portfolio prioritizing resources to our most attractive opportunities. We will strengthen our innovation model and continue to invest in research and development, which enables us to create unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. In addition, we will continue to invest in high-growth, high-value product platforms such as automotive electrification, advanced wound care and data centers. We will also step up our efforts to fully leverage the progress we've made on business transformation. With our most recent deployment in the United States we have now successfully deployed 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. I am pleased with the success of our rollouts in Europe and the US. This was a significant undertaking and I thank our team for their tireless efforts. Moving ahead, we'll be able to focus even more on leveraging the power of business transformation to improve service levels to our customers, improve productivity and accelerate value realization, and at our Investor Day next month, we look forward to sharing more details about our plans. With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research; please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I don't recall covered your stock a long time-- I just don't recall the type of volatility you had in the Healthcare business, the drug delivery you mentioned was down 25% is this - can you give us a little bit granularity behind what causes or is causing that kind of volatility right now? Mike Roman : Yes. Scott as we talked about on the opening here, the organic growth was impacted by drug delivery down double digits. And also we did have a strong year-over-year comp as we came through Q3 of 2017. Broader we see solid growth in oral care, our food safety business continue to strong growth, health information systems, strong pipeline right where we expected. So must of the rest of portfolio is in line with expectations. I would say that the drug delivery business continues to be the challenge against what we saw for the growth for the total year. Scott Davis : So, yes, I am not sure that answers my question. Is there an inventory de-stock at the customer level? I'm trying to just think about that, I'm assuming the customer, the end consumer still consuming these drugs-- so what's going on at the part of the pharmaceutical companies at least that's what I am asking? Mike Roman : Yes, so our drug delivery business it's-- it's - we've talked about it as a project based business in the past. It really is-- we work in partnership with pharmaceutical companies really dependent on their regulatory cycle also we have significant R&D partnership as well and those are project based businesses as well. So we see strong pipeline ahead. We are working through a challenging performance in 2018. We see stabilization as we get into 2019 and strong growth. So we have good view of our pipeline but not impacting positively as we go through the second half of this year. Scott Davis : Okay. That's a good answer. And then Consumer, you talked about the inventory channel de-stock, is this --is this kind of a new normal where it seems like the retailers are just holding less inventory, do you view it as a new normal adjustment kind of one time or is this something where you anticipate some additional de-stock here going forward? Mike Roman : Yes, it's been something that we've seen with the office channel over the last year and a half almost two years now where you see a restructuring of the channel and you see a destocking as the traditional office channel restructures around the new normal for them. I think we see it more broadly as well that we are a point of sales is strong up mid single digit across portfolio, both the retail channel is at least as we come to this second half of the year see additional restructuring in. And we expect some of that to continue as we move ahead. This is a space that's been disrupted significantly and it's something that we expect to see some individual channels as we move ahead, but really it's the broader base in the second half that's impacting us now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning, guys. Can we maybe start on just US growth? So I recognize that the ERP transition probably impacted growth little bit this quarter and I think Mike you mentioned a 100 basis points earlier. But I'm just parse out like how much of-- how much of the 50 basis points of growth you saw this quarter is related to ERP versus like what you're seeing from an end-market perspective just give that the US has been so strong across industrial for most of the year. Mike Roman : Yes. So if you look at that 100 basis points so we talked about, that's a worldwide view are really 250 basis points of impact on the quarter in the US. And as I mentioned we saw most of that, the vast majority of given back in Q3. So year-to-date up 3% is more in line with when you look through that what we're seeing. And we see positive growth in Industrial, Safety and Graphics Electronics and Energy and really we see the macro more broadly in the US positive and steady. It was, I would say-- we're back talking about our Healthcare organic growth being impacted by our drug delivery business in the US and a strong year-on-year comp in the US especially strong in that area, and then I would say consumer organic growth was impacted by that US ERP as strong as anyone any one of the businesses in our portfolio. So, they had their full share of those 250 basis points. Joe Ritchie : And Mike is it your assumption going into 4Q that the ERP overhang kind of subsides or is that something that just carries into 4Q as well? Mike Roman : Yes, I think that's the view we saw the vast majority come out in Q3 so that's not the big impact as we go into Q-- as we go into Q4. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And then my one follow-up just on China obviously through the first three quarters of the year things have held up very good; we're seeing signs of things slowing down particularly on the Consumer side, I'm just curious if you can give any color around the trends that you saw through the quarter and what you're seeing specifically with the Chinese consumer? Mike Roman : Yes, we mentioned that the slowing in the consumer respiratory protection space as one of the impacts. We see other signs of slowing in China, automotive build rates are down significantly. And that has a knock on effect and so you see some broader softness in industrial as we go into Q4. So we are seeing the same thing that's why we see ourselves tracking more to 8% to 10% range for China for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please proceed. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike can you give us more color what happened in Europe this quarter? We know you are expecting a slowdown in the US given the ERP. You just talked about China but EMEA seemed to fall off significantly for you versus last quarter. I think Western Europe was up 6 last quarters and down 2 this quarter. So as Western Europe, is the European decline acquire just more lumpiness or is there something a little more worrisome there? Mike Roman : Yes, so our broader Europe is tracking to the low end of the-- of the range that we had for the year and the 1% to 4%. As we came into the quarter the Industrial and auto build rates softened a bit and we saw softening across West Europe and organic growth declined in the quarter up slightly year-to-date and we think up slightly for the full year and so at the bottom end of the range. I think it's also being impacted by some of the portfolio actions that that we are taking as we talked about as we've gone through the year part of our plan to improve the overall performance of the portfolio and the profitability of West Europe as we move ahead, but tracking low single-digits at the at the bottom of our range for the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, do you have this visibility though into that sort of low single-digit growth as you go forward because it has been a very lumpy region for you? Mike Roman : Yes. I think we have good visibility across the portfolio and the markets and I would say that the softening in the automotive and the build rates have an impact there. We have been talking about this being towards the low end of the range all year really because of the outlook we have across the markets in our portfolio and also some of those actions we've been taking. So I think it's consistent a little softer than expected in Q3, but, again, for the full year we think it's about in the range where we expected it to be. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then Nick your price with raw material plus point three, pricing up one point obviously good results there. Can you maintain positive price versus raws even if tariff continue to ramp? And could you talk about how you are adjusting raw material sourcing under supply chain to adjust to the inflationary environment, especially if we see more tariffs moving forward? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andy, we are continuing to see raw material price increases and so our pricing has more than been offsetting that and Andy it's our expectation that will continue. We are anticipating continued increase in raw material prices and layering on tariffs that we expect our price strength to continue to more than offset that. If I fast forward a little into 2019, we think tariffs will be having a negative impact on our total sourcing cost. There are a number of things we're doing around that source changes, supply-chain changes but also pricing changes. And I'll talk more about this in on November 15th but our view is we have approximately $100 million headwind from tariffs. And that our pricing will more than offset that and raw material price increases in to 2010. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just a question around the moving parts in the P&L, particularly I guess your SG&A was down sort of 90 bps a share of sale, R&D down 40 bps a share of sales to offset falling gross margin. Is there any change to the view that R&D to sales of 6% is the right number and what's the risk I guess that R&D and SG&A expenses have to sort of snap back up over the next 12 months? Mike Roman : Yes. Julian, let me take the R&D part first. On the research and development as you heard of stock, it's heartbeat of 3M, it's the center of innovation and it's the key for us sustaining our performance, premium margins, our growth, our return on invested capital. So it's still a top priority for us and a top priority for me as CEO. We are going to continue to invest in it, continue to target that approximately 6% to sales and if you look at the quarter majority of the year-over-year decline in the quarter was really due to a couple of factors; FX of course the contract R&D work that-- that I talked about in the drug delivery business was part of it, and also the divestiture of the communication market. So, that-- it's really and there are some quarterly up and downs as we make investments in experiments and a number of projects and so it's still very much the focus there. If you look at SG&A, I think that's another one that. We --our spending is not completely smooth, but we're making improvements as well on productivity. That's one of the things that we're getting as we move forward business transformation as we take now 70% of our revenue onto business transformation. We have opportunities to leverage our service models and engage in some improvements there. So, you know, at least a little bit of what we saw in the quarter was starting to see some productivity there, and I think of the actions that we've been-- strategic investments we've been making impacting that as well. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then my follow-up question would be around Healthcare, you had laid out-- or the management team had laid out the 4% to 6% top-line growth aspiration two and half years ago; Healthcare is consistently run at or slightly below the bottom end of that range even prior to the drug delivery issues. So do you think that's the addressable market growth coming in light or do you think there is a need of 3M itself to step up M&A and/or R&D to close the gap with the growing market? Mike Roman : Yes, Julian, I would say that - I talked about the broader portfolio. We have much of the rest of the portfolio beyond drug delivery that's in line with our expectations. And if you if you step back and look at the 4% to 6% and where we are now in the 2% to 3% range versus that 4% to 6% or even as we as we kind of reset and said 4% as we came through the year, it's largely drug delivery and slower oral care. We saw a better oral care performance in the quarter as we move through the year; kind of what we expected, but, still when you look against that 4% to 6% those are the two impacts - that our biggest impact. The year-over-year comps are part of it in the quarter, but if you look at the total year now - those are the impacts. We expect Q4 to be a return to our historical growth rates in healthcare so as we lap some of the drug delivery comps and we get those broader performing portfolios to have a bigger impact. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning. Hey Mike, I just want to characterize what you're really seeing out there; you've already from a growth perspective, if you take out the ERP impact, if you take out what you would describe as kind of disrupted channel related to distributor and retail destocking, I guess you have slowing China and some European challenge, and you take out the Europe-- the drug delivery are you seeing kind of any short-cycle slowing globally from a demand perspective or do you think these are all kind of more 3M specific issues that you're going to be getting through and then normalizing? Mike Roman : Yes, see I think you've characterized it well. The areas that we've talked about already, and we have highlighted number of businesses where there specific to our markets and our businesses in those markets. I would say that we've performed well and automotive as Nick noted we performed well in the automotive OEMs are relative to their bill grades, but their bill rates continue to move down negative actually in the quarter and part of the slowing in China and part of the impact in Europe as well. We highlighted as well, safety and graphics has been at the top of the range that we have guided for the year and really was we expect them to be there at the end of the year but we're impacted by a negative mid teens growth in our industrial mineral business, that's another one. But again it's kind of a maybe it's our focus on construction markets and some of the challenges we see in some of those end markets, but that was definitely softness in one of our markets. So, broader we see a steady and positive macro and broader our portfolio the majority of our businesses continue to do well against that broader macro. Steven Winoker : Okay, and then and I of course on that, it doesn't change your sort of normal 1.5x IPI thinking? Mike Roman : Well, yes. It's on the broader portfolio absolutely and as we move ahead that's the model that we look at it, individual business is impacting the way they did here in the quarter and maybe a couple of them as we go through the second half, it's those are - those will take away from some of that near term, but yes, that's absolutely our performance, that's our focus, that's our expectations, that's our capacity and capability that we demonstrated. Steven Winoker : And I don't want to miss read your portfolio optimization comment towards the end of your prepared remarks. But that is something that 3M certainly had been emphasizing for sometime with Inge and with you before, so do you need something different here in this - what do you mean by that? Mike Roman : Well, that you said it; portfolio management has been one of our key leverage. It's a driver of value for us, you look at the performance we have in electronics and energy and in safety and graphics as we come through the year those business are performing well and they have been an area that we focused a lot of our portfolio that actions around it's what we have done to reposition and reshape those portfolios through acquisition and divestitures and other actions, I think that's an example of where we take that lever and really create value and so we're always looking at that, we are always realigning our businesses around our portfolio priorities it's how we reshape the company for near term and long-term success. So it's I guess and I said that at the last call as well, we are in active portfolio of manager this is what we do to take full advantage of the 3M model as we move ahead. Steven Winoker : Okay, and if I can just sneak in one specific think for Nick. On the inventory days and I suppose receivables. Just slight increases that are going out there. I assume that's all ERP related or is there something else going on? Nick Gangestad : No. Steve, that's exactly - we had built some inventory in advance of going live in the US with our new ERP system. And we wanted to do that in order to ensure we were fully satisfying our customers and their supply chain and the increase you are seeing there is that not bleeding off quite as fast as we had planned but we see over the next couple of quarters that inventory coming down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed. John Inch : Thanks, good morning everyone. Hi, guys. So, Mike it sounds like your characterizing Europe and maybe Asia Pac a little bit as relatively stable. I think that's kind of messaging that I am getting maybe at a slightly decelerated basis. I wanted just kind of confirm that's what you're seeing Brexit or any other issues are not necessarily sequentially affecting your businesses and on that basis, is this causing you this kind of low level activity stability, because you're very big company in Europe. Is it causing you to allocate your R&D or your growth initiatives in any kind of a different way to try and stimulate things more quickly to circumvent auto, just curious on those fronts. Mike Roman : Yes, John I think you characterized West Europe and Europe overall the way we kind of view it right now, and again we see some markets like auto impacting Europe as well, drug delivery of course impacting Europe as well. But more broadly we see it a steady economic backdrop, we're not looking at other significant changes there. And Asia I guess I would characterize it maybe at the low end of our range that we had looked at for the year so softer overall but again steady across more broadly with sometimes as long as I've said in China. And so if you look back at West Europe, your question there we are --we deployed the business transformation there over the 2015-16-17 and we're now taking advantage of that and we are I would say doing a couple of things, it's enabling us to prioritize better where we really do invest in our best parts of our portfolio. It's the models that we have in place the service models that we have in place there up and running be able to leverage area wide ERP capability. Those are really enabling us to I think bring even sharper focus on prioritizing and that's part of our active portfolio management as prioritizing where we put our resources for growth shifting resources to those higher growth areas. We're also as planned taking some actions to I would say streamline our structure in EMEA and even Latin America as we get ready for the go live taking advantage of business transformation so that's really also helping us the focus on the markets in areas that are most important and best opportunities for growth as we go ahead. John Inch : So on that point you just read about business transformation ERP maybe this is for Nick, Nick give us a sense of how much BTU may have actually net contributed in the quarter and I know you haven't really updated your 500 to 700 target in Ohio right from business transformation specifically but can you give us at least an elementary advances as this is coming through. Are we looking at the low end or the high end of that range or a new range all together? Nick Gangestad : As far as the savings, John, we are --what we've been saying and continue to say is that by 2020 we expect this to generate between $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit. this year we're on track for approximately $100 million of savings versus last year, that will bring our total savings since we started that on an annual basis up to $250 million and we remained on track on the 500 to 700 not ready to call whether we think more likely low end or high end, but we still see ourselves in that range by 2020. And as Mike mentioned earlier on this call we have a lot of the deployment behind us now and that's allowing us in 2019 to be putting even more energy and resources into realizing the value realization that that we've been projecting so a little bit of a shift of little less on deployment and more on the value realization and the business process changes that will create that. John Inch : And to be clear about $100 million is a net number right like that goal flowing to the bottom line pretax? Nick Gangestad : That's exactly right John. John Inch : And then one more just nitpick here. Why haven't you updated the 500 to 700? I mean this goes back a few years ago right. Is there some obvious reason why should base on the nature of the way this stuff is working that you can't --you haven't actually provided some sort of look forward based on progress or realized results is that just because the U.S. would save for the last and it's the biggest slug or is there some other reason why this thing is not being updated or would have been updated sort of more quickly? Nick Gangestad : Yes. We last updated that number in 2016 when we laid out a five year plan and we've continued to progress as we expected towards that. November 15th when we lay out our next five year plan we'll be updating that if where this goes even beyond 2020 and so partly John it lines up with longer term plans that we lay out and you can expect to see more from us on in November. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi good morning guys. Just I know there've been a lot of questions on growth and maybe not quite what we would have expected in terms of some of the bigger global controversial end markets like auto or the consumer in U.S. and China, it don't seem to be as big of a drag a lot more 3M specific stuff which I think some of the earlier questions have noted. Do you feel like over next couple of quarters and I don't want to get into 2019 too specifically, but do you think there is a smooth hand off where some of the 3M specific issues or some of the submarkets start to balance out and we can still kind of swim upstream versus some of the more controversial ones like auto or is there potential for say someone have to bleed down further into your business?. Mike Roman : Yes, Josh, if you look at some of the businesses we've highlighted today that are impacting growth as we come through Q3 and the second half. We'll, couple of things will happen. One we'll lap some of those comps as we move ahead. And they're going to expect. I mean we're, we expect to improve those businesses. And I mentioned in drug delivery that we stabilized based on what we have in the pipeline as we get into the 2019 and we returned to growth as we come out of that. And so we can look forward and we can see that stepping into it. Automotive is maybe a little more complex in the dynamic. I mean we're outgrowing the build rates and have consistently done that and with what we're doing with automotive electrification, we see our ability to do that to continue and even leverage our innovation further in the future. But we're still dependent on the build rates. And so what happens in those build rates as we move ahead where it goes in key markets like U.S., Europe, China, those are going to impact that. The outlook right now is fairly nominal low growth negative growth as we come through the quarter in third quarter, but slow growth as we move ahead. So I would say we'll continue to outgrow that that will continue to be a growth contributor with what we've been able to do there. Other markets industrial mineral what happens in the end market demand will dictate that more than us as we get into future quarters. So I think it's little bit market dependent, but the one examples that we've talked about, I think we do see ourselves being able to continue to rise up in our growth relative to those markets. If you go turn to consumer, the thing I would look at is our sale out continued strong. Our brands, we got category leading brands that are performing well off the shelf, we've got to work through, and I think our team is done a very good job of working through the channel disruption that's going on there and managing through that. We've got very good visibility as we move through that especially in developed markets. And we expect to see that sale out to eventually rise up and carry the day. And so we'll look for that as we go ahead too. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe I could just follow on with the teaser for what you may talk about here in few weeks in November. Clearly a lot of questions about growth here on today. I think business transformation phase 1 has been a lot more margin centric and there is always been an aspiration for phase 2 to have a growth component. Is that something we could start to hear a little bit more about in the coming weeks or is that still few years off in terms of being quantified? Mike Roman : Josh it goes to John's question and Nick's discussion earlier too. Our business transformation was focused on putting the ERP and much broader than the ERP other system capabilities in place new models transaction efficient models in place in our supply chain and in our back office. And that's we're doing with business transformation. But as we do that as we now get 70% of our revenue on the new systems, we can start to leverage that in other ways as well. And we'll be talking about at the November 15 Investor Day. We'll talk about where we see opportunities to do that on the commercial side and also in supply chain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi good morning. I guess just trying to put a finer point on the new organic growth guidance. A squiggle does imply a range, so I was just curious as we think about Q4 would you expect to see organic growth accelerate from the 13 we saw this quarter or how should we think about that? Nick Gangestad : Yes, John. We're just a little over a 3% through the first nine months of the year for growth. And when we're estimating 3 that's our best estimate of what the total year growth will be? I don't see a very wide range on that maybe 20 basis points plus or minus but not a very wide range on that. And yes, that included in that as an expectation that we see higher organic growth in Q4 than what we saw in Q3. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for that. And then, you touched on the savings portion of business transformation, and how to think about that. But how should we think about the spending, obviously this year there were some restructuring around getting out of those stranded costs, but how do we think about the actual spending levels that you are absorbing in your earnings construct as we as we think about that into 2019. Nick Gangestad : And John, you're specifically talking about our business transformation and what we're spending on that. John Walsh : However you wanted kind of define if you want to take a broader turn that, and if you want to kind of that one program. Nick Gangestad : John, in terms of the business transformation, over a number of years, we've been saying this is going to be an incremental spends of a little over $1 billion. And as I look, as we look at our spending over the last few years, in terms of cash outflow that has been declining. In terms of total in spending, hitting our income statement as we start to amortize some of what we built there. It's been remarkable flat year-on-year of the total spend that we're putting into our business transformation initiative. And right now my view is that's going to continue and a pretty stable level for the next couple years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Can you hear me? Just question on safety and graphics, I think you guys highlight a lot of headwinds when you were at Laguna, but that one is a bit of a surprise to me and a couple of things, organic growth, 2% margin declined year-over-year and particularly you guys highlighted roofing granules, declining double-digits, and as I recall, this was one of the businesses that was supposed to drive big growth and big margin expansion post everything you've done to it in terms of repositioning this business. Can you just talk what happened the quarter and has something changed here or is it a one off? Nick Gangestad : Andrew the roofing granules business is the smallest business we have in Safety and Graphics. And it's a business that has been enjoying, in the U.S. some of the construction increases that they are going on in construction as well as there's a cyclical or a temporary nature depending on what's happening with storms. So in this business is very closely tied to shingle production. And right now, shingles manufacturers are making less, making less shingles. And it's a very tightly integrated supply chain. So for the last couple years this business has been on a path of high growth and we reached a point in the third quarter that, that growth has come down. And the growth going forward is going to be tightly correlated to what happens with shingle manufacturers in the amount of production they're doing. Andrew Obin : And is broader for safety and graphics margin decline year-over-year and sort of this growth that maybe 2%. Because I always thought, this was the business that was supposed to go tighten; this was the showcase of how you can sort of realign your portfolio and achieve better margins and better growth. I guess maybe a broader question here. Nick Gangestad : Yes, broader question. So right now we're estimating this business to be about at the midpoint of the 4% to 6% organic growth that we guided at the beginning of the year. And that midpoint is absorbing what we're seeing as the impact from the roofing granules business. As far as the total growth in the third quarter. See in mid-single-digit growth in our personal safety business against a 14% comp in our personal safety, that is by far our biggest business. Andrew, we continue to have a lot of confidence in our safety and graphic business and its ability to grow and be a leader in growing 3M's total organic growth, a lot of confidence there. As far as the margin, we are absorbing 150 basis points of margin impact from Scott Safety and we'll be starting to look lap ourselves on that as we acquired that fourth quarter last year. And I no longer we'll see that as being dragged to the margin going forward and potentially accretive going after that. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up sort of the counterpoint to safety and graphics. Everybody was concerned about electronics and energy and you guys actually posted really good growths throughout this expectation margin was north of 30%, is the margins sustainable or were they one-time items or how should we think about that? Nick Gangestad : Andrew, if you look at the history of Electronics and Energy Q3 tends to be the high point for our revenue and our margin for that business. Year-to-date our margins are 28.4%; that's up 170 basis points in that. That includes the impact of exiting our communication markets business. So, yes, the portfolio management we have been doing and the things we are doing and investing in research, we see as being accretive to our margins in that business, but I would not call the 31 plus that we are at this-- in this quarter as a new level-- is more third quarter is typically the high point. Andrew Obin : But it's just-- there is no one-time big items, it's just everything one right for this business in this quarter. Is that fair to describe? Nick Gangestad : That's exactly right, everything going right in this business this quarter; no one-time issue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good morning. So, just so I kind of understand the comments on R&D correctly, are you saying that kind of that the-- the productivity which you are getting out of business transformation et cetera is allowing you to kind structurally kind of spend a lower level of R&D than the 6% going forward? Mike Roman : Steve, I would-- I guess my message here is that we have not backed off of what we've been targeting with our R&D investment. This idea of investing to enable us to drive more of those priority growth platforms, more of the disruptive new technology, that's what we talked about when we move from 5.5% of sales to 6% to sales, and so while in the quarter we are down at 5.3, our strategy and our plan is to invest in line with what we've talked about when we said we are targeting 6%. It's not an efficiency that we are gaining there. There are some one-time kinds of impacts on the quarter just a little bit of ebb and flow-- we expected a little overspending just by the layout of our R&D programs as we went through the year, and then we had the drug delivery contract R&D work down. We had impact of FX and we had the divesture of communications markets. So, no-- they usually expect us to continue to drive that-- this is not a BT enabled-- we do-- we certainly do expect to get returns out of these investments and will adjust as we move ahead, but, near-term that's not-- that's not what's going on. Steve Tusa : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. When we kind of think about, how you are kind of positioned and how you are-- what your mindset is for the next several years, the last few years you have had a couple that have been pretty good, but not too many in the kind of double-digit EPS growth range, and that's despite some very heavy stock buyback activity, were you kind of providing a new framework for EPS at some point? Do you wonder in your watch at least? Or is the 8% to 11% still kind of a relevant number, and it's been a really steady as she goes on that front? Or are we going to get an update on that? Mike Roman : Well, that's certainly one of the things we will be talking about the November Investor Day. That's-- we will be laying out our five-year plan and the framework for that five-year plan, and so I think that's something will cover in detail there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Nigel Wolfe : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the ENE margin, you mentioned everything went right but this is I think the second or third quarter where we have seen diversion trends between ENE and the rest of the portfolio, if you can just maybe just expand how you are seeing such strong open leverage in ENE versus -the -in those trends elsewhere? Nick Gangestad : So, Nigel, what we have been seeing-- and I mentioned this earlier on this call, we are continued to see good penetration and content that we are putting into electronic devices, we are seeing good growth in places where we are selling into datacenters and semiconductors, that growth is helping us and is being accretive to our-- to our margin. In addition, the divesture of our communication markets business within that, which had been dilutive to our margin that is now, for all practical purposes, out of that business and we are also seeing some accretive benefits from that. So, that's what I was saying that many things going right this quarter. As we have focused on that portfolio and what we are investing in and we are seeing a lot of that pay off. Nigel Wolfe : Okay but the key message is that we exit this year, obviously recognizing the seasonality from speaking in 4Q, whatever ENE is this year, is a good base for future years. Okay. And then my typical question again, kind of things about November, when we look at the last three to five years, core growth being in the 2% or 3% range on average, 2.7% for the last three years, I know you are not going to be satisfied with that kind of growth range, what in your mind is the biggest kind of restrain on growth here. Is the R&D pipeline, the commercialization; is it some share loss competition? What is the biggest recurring force on core growth here? Mike Roman : Yes, Nigel, growth is a big focus as we drive forward, I mean it's what we expect our innovation model to deliver, and I would say above-market growth and premium margins. That's really a - I think the hallmark of successful innovation and for us that's been really our history. When we deliver on that, that's what we see. And we expect to see that outgrow the macro and to be able to do that consistently as we move ahead, and so that, that is the focus, that's what we will talk about at the Investor Day that's what we will focused on with our team. That's the way we-- that's where we start our focus as a team. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : In summary, our third quarter included good performances in many respects including double-digit increases in cash flow and EPS along with strong margins. As I look across our portfolio, most of our businesses continue to do well, but there are also areas that we must work to improve. Looking ahead, how we allocate capital and continue to reshape our portfolio are keys to delivering even greater value to both our customers and shareholders. These are strengths of 3M and will continue to be priorities for us moving forward. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you in St. Paul in a few weeks. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time, if you have a question, please press the one followed by the four on your telephone keypad. It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, January 29, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2019 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 25, July 25, and October 24. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will open with a brief summary of our fourth quarter and later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full-year performance along with our outlook for 2019. 3M executed well in the fourth quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. We delivered organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with a double-digit increase in both cash flow and adjusted earnings. Looking at the numbers, total sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 3%, which is on top of 6% growth in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Growth was led by our healthcare business group, which grew 5% organically, along with electronics and energy, which grew 4%. With respect to EPS, our team delivered adjusted earnings of $2.31 per share, up 10% year over year. This includes a $0.02 net benefit from a divestiture which Nick will cover in more detail. The strength of our value model is enabling us to consistently generate premium margins and healthy cash flow. Margins in the quarter were more than 22% with all of our business groups above 21%. Cash flow increased by 23% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 128%. Finally, in the fourth quarter we returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. That concludes my opening comments. I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take us through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 3% with volumes up 160 basis points and selling prices up 140 basis points. The communication markets divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points while foreign currency translation was an additional 2.3 percentage point headwind to sales. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 60 basis points versus last year. Geographically, the U.S. grew 4.4% organically with broad-based growth across all business groups. Latin America-Canada was up 5% organically with broad-based growth across Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Asia Pacific grew organically 2% in Q4, led by double-digit increase in healthcare and mid-single-digit growth in electronics and energy. Organic growth was up 1% in China-Hong Kong versus 18% a year ago. China-Hong Kong organic growth was led by healthcare and electronics and energy, while safety and graphics and consumer declined. Finally, organic growth was up 1.3% in EMEA with West Europe flat. EMEA was led by mid-single-digit growth in both healthcare and safety and graphics, while consumer and electronics and energy declined. Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion and operating margins of 22.4%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Organic volume, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added 100 basis points to margins. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains, net of actions reduced margins by 130 basis points. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 20 basis points to fourth quarter margins. Finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 10 basis points.  Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $2.27 per share. Please note that this result included a couple items that were not included in our guidance. First, during the quarter we recorded a net $0.04 tax charge. This charge relates to the transition tax and the deductibility of our Q1 2018 legal settlement associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Secondly, we completed the final piece of the communication markets divestiture, resulting in a net $0.02 earnings benefit. Taking into account these items, fourth quarter underlying earnings were $2.29 per share. As you see, a number of factors impacted fourth quarter earnings. The benefits of organic growth, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.18 to per-share earnings in the quarter. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains net of related actions reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.13 per share versus last year. Foreign currency, net of hedging was an additional $0.03 per share earnings headwind in the quarter. Other expense contributed $0.06 to earnings year-on-year as higher Q4 2018 retirement expense and underlying net interest expense was more than offset by last year\u2019s fourth quarter repurchase of high coupon debt. Our underlying tax rate was lower year-on-year, which added $0.05 to Q4 earnings; and finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by over 3% versus Q4 last year, adding an additional $0.08 to per-share earnings. Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 23% year-on-year with a free cash flow conversion rate of 128%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $531 million with the full year totaling $1.6 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. Let\u2019s now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 9. The industrial business delivered organic growth of 2.5% in Q4 and 3.2% for the year, with growth across all geographic areas for the quarter and full year. Growth was led by advanced materials, up double digits followed by low-single-digit growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, separation and purification, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket. Our automotive OEM business was down 1% year-on-year versus a 5% decline in fourth quarter global car and light truck builds. For both the quarter and the full year, our auto OEM business outperformed global car and light truck builds by 400 basis points, continuing our long track record of outperformance. On a geographic basis, industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. while the other three geographic areas each grew low single digits. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $627 million with an operating margin of 21.2%. Underlying margins were up 40 basis points year-on-year adjusting for last year\u2019s portfolio and footprint actions. Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter safety and graphic sales grew 3.3% organically versus an 11% comparison a year ago. For the full year, safety and graphics was up 5.1%. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 7% organically. Scott Safety continues to do well with strong double-digit growth in Q4. Commercial solutions grew low single digits while transportation safety declined mid-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined low teens as shingle manufacturers continued with lower production volumes in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, followed by the U.S. and EMEA which were each up 5%.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was $345 million with operating margins of 22%. Underlying margins were down 110 basis points year-on-year due to the sales decline in roofing granules along with some additional fourth quarter actions. Please turn to Slide 11. Our healthcare business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 4.8% organically. In Q4, our medical solutions business posted mid-single digit organic growth with particular strength in vascular access and procurement solutions. Oral care grew 4% in the quarter with positive growth in both the U.S. and international. Our 3M Clarity clear tray aligners launch continues to build momentum. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by a high single-digit increase in food safety followed by mid-single digit growth in health information systems.  On a geographic basis, healthcare grew across all areas with continued strength in developing markets, led by China-Hong Kong up 18% in the quarter. Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $458 million with margins of 30.2%. We continue to focus on investing in our priority growth platforms in advanced wound care, population health, and custom orthodontics. Next, let\u2019s cover electronics and energy on Slide 12. Electronics and energy finished the year with solid fourth quarter organic sales growth of 4.1%. The electronics side of the business delivered fourth quarter organic of 3% with similar growth in both electronic materials and display solutions. On the energy side of the business, sales were up 5% organically with strong growth in both grid modernization and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, while both the U.S. and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for electronics and energy was $396 million with operating margins of 29.5%.  Please turn to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in consumer were $1.2 billion with organic growth of 1.9% year-on-year. Growth was led by our home improvement business up mid-single digits and stationary and office was up low single digits, while home care and consumer healthcare declined. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 6% increase in Latin America-Canada with the U.S. up 5%. EMEA declined 7% as we continue to adjust our product portfolio in this region. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 5% as we continue to experience lower year-on-year demand for our consumer respiratory solutions, particularly in China-Hong Kong due to improved air quality. Finally, fourth quarter operating income was $257 million with operating margins of 21.3%.  That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14, and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter capped an important year for 3M as we posted good results and continued to transform for the future. We delivered organic growth of more than 3% with growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We expanded GAAP earnings per share by more than 12% to $8.89, or $9.96 on an underlying basis. We posted free cash flow conversion of 91% along with a return on invested capital of more than 22%.  In 2018, we also delivered record sales of $33 billion while returning significant cash to our shareholders. All in, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and last year was our 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. Please turn to Slide 15. Beyond financial results, in 2018 we continued to position 3M for long term growth and value creation. This includes executing our four priorities, which I laid out at our investor day in November. I\u2019ll comment briefly on the impact of each priority, starting with portfolio.  The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value for our customers and shareholders. In 2018 for example, we sold our communication markets business. This builds on the portfolio work we\u2019ve done over the last several years in electronics and energy which has led to improved growth and margins. Last month, we also announced the acquisition of MModal\u2019s technology business, which is a leading provider of AI-powered healthcare solutions. As you recall, two years ago we decided to retain and further invest in our health information systems business. This acquisition builds on that commitment and will expand our ability to improve outcomes for both patients and providers. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter and its impact is reflected in our updated guidance for 2019, which I\u2019ll cover shortly. Turning now to transformation, which is fundamentally improving how we serve our customers, how we work and how we compete, 2018 was an important year in our transformation journey. Our team executed our ERP deployment across all five business groups in the United States, which accounts for nearly 40% of our global sales. This was a significant undertaking. I commend our people for successfully rolling out our new systems and I thank our customers for working closely with us through this change. With the U.S. rollout, we have deployed approximately 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. We are now stepping up our efforts to fully leverage this progress and accelerate value realization for our customers and our company. Ultimately, transformation is making 3M a more agile, more efficient and more competitive enterprise.  Our next priority is innovation. Innovation is fundamental to our organic growth and is key to our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital. It allows us to create unique, differentiated solutions for our customers, which leads to superior returns for our shareholders. In 2018, we continued to invest in both research and development and capex, with accelerated investments in our priority growth platforms focused around healthcare, transportation, safety and infrastructure. Technology is advancing rapidly in these market spaces, and 3M will continue to capitalize on these opportunities as we move ahead. This brings me to people and culture, which is foundational to each of the other priorities. Everything that differentiates 3M - our technologies, our manufacturing, our global reach, our brand - starts with our people. In 2018, we expanded development opportunities for 3Mers while launching initiatives to deepen our commitment to sustainability, diversity and inclusion. We also earned a number of external recognitions, including being named one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for the fifth straight year. In summary, our team made good progress on each of our priorities in 2018 and we are positioned for a successful 2019. Please turn to Slide 16. As you recall, at our investor day in November we laid out our guidance framework for 2019. Since then, there has been slowing in key end markets with the biggest impact coming from China, automotive and electronics; therefore, we are widening our range for expected organic growth to 1 to 4% against the prior range of 2 to 4%. We now anticipate EPS of $10.45 to $10.90, which includes a $0.10 earnings headwind from the MModal acquisition, against a previous range of $10.60 to $11.05. Please note that the prior range did not include the MModal impact. We continue to expect a return on invested capital of 22 to 25% along with a free cash flow conversion rate of 95 to 105%. Please turn to Slide 17. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth, starting with our business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by healthcare with a range of 3 to 5%, followed by safety and graphics at 2 to 5%. Organic growth in industrial is expected in the range of 1 to 4% with electronics and energy at zero to 4% and consumer at 1 to 3%.  Looking by geographic area, we expect organic growth in the United States of 2 to 4% followed by EMEA at 1 to 3%. Organic growth in Asia Pacific is expected in the range of 1 to 5% with Latin America-Canada at 3 to 5%.  I\u2019ll now turn it back to Nick, who will provide some color on our 2019 outlook. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks Mike. Please turn to Slide 18. Here are our key planning assumptions in 2019. Most of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we discussed at our November investor day, with the exception of three items. First is the expanded full-year organic growth range that Mike just discussed. Second is in regards to our global pension expense. December\u2019s market volatility lowered our 2019 earnings benefit versus our expectation in November. Lastly, we are now including the estimated full-year growth and earnings impact from the pending MModal acquisition. Other items to note, we are forecasting full-year foreign currency translation to be a 1% headwind to sales but neutral to earnings. Turning to raw materials, we do anticipate higher year-on-year costs, including tariff impacts; however, we continue to expect our selling prices along with our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing productivity efforts to more than offset the expected raw material headwinds. We estimate the 2019 impact from the pending MModal acquisition net of the communication markets divestiture to be neutral to sales and an earnings headwind of $0.15 per share. We continue to increase our efforts to accelerate benefits from transformation, portfolio and footprint optimization, along with our manufacturing and SG&A productivity. Lastly, we forecast our full-year tax rate to be 20 to 22% versus our 2018 underlying rate of 20%. I\u2019ll now move to our 2019 capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Our strong operational cash flow fuels our capital allocation plan. We expect another year of strong cash flow from operations with 2019 estimated to be between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion prior to our investments in R&D and our global pension plans. All in, including cash, marketable securities, and added leverage, our 2019 plan calls for $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion of available capital. Our first priority for capital deployment remains investing in our business, which includes research and development and capex supplemented with acquisitions, while at the same time returning cash to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 20. Here you can see our 2019 earnings road map based on the key assumptions I just laid out. For 2019, we expect per-share earnings in the range of $10.45 to $10.90, including a negative $0.10 impact from the MModal acquisition. This earnings range represents an increase of 5 to 9% year-on-year compared to our 2018 underlying EPS of $9.96.  To wrap up, fourth quarter was a good finish to 2018. We are focused on executing our four priorities along with delivering on our financial objectives in 2019.  With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Just a question on Asia - you guys clearly seem to have a better handle on your customers than a lot of other folks, but as we think about 2019, do you have a sense when Asia growth bottoms ex-whatever contingency you have on the tariff negotiations? How should we think about the pace of growth in Asia throughout 2019? Michael Roman : Andrew, if you look at the guidance we have for Asia in our outlook, we see it pretty balanced across the year within those ranges and within that range of guidance. Now, the caution as we start the year is really focused on not so much trade and tariff, but on the impact in end markets that we talked about - automotive and electronics are the focus for the slower, more cautious view as we look to 2019. So, I think as we get a better view of what\u2019s going to go on in those end markets, that would change where we are in the range, but I think that balance across the year is the way I\u2019d have you think about it. Andrew Obin : Just a follow-up question. A couple of people asked us about R&D spend. Your longer term framework, 6% for the year, I think in \u201918 it was 5.6 for the quarter, 5.5. Any timing on R&D in 2018 and how should we think about R&D in 2019? Michael Roman : This is--as you said, Andrew, this is still a priority and we\u2019re committed to this. It\u2019s what drives our differentiation, our innovation in 3M, and if you look at where we are in the quarter, we saw some impact from the contract R&D work that we do for customers and I would say the divestiture of the communication markets, so those are a few of the things that kept us a little lower in the quarter. We are committed to driving that model, that 6% R&D and the investment in capex that goes along with it. If you look at 2018, we actually did have an increase in headcount, so it\u2019s a better reflection maybe of our commitment to that ongoing investment. Andrew Obin : Terrific, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just following up on Andrew\u2019s question on China, and more specifically auto and electronics, you took the guide down by a point at the low end, not really surprising given what we\u2019re seeing across the value chain. I guess the question though, is, it seems like those end markets were generally okay for the quarter. How did things progress during the quarter, and what are you actually seeing in your core business that makes you feel like growth will be slower in those end markets for 2019? Michael Roman : Joe, we talked about this a bit at the third quarter call that we saw some slowing in China as we went into Q4, and automotive was one of the things that we talked about. That said, we saw additional slowing as we exited the quarter, and you see it in the projection for build rates, the updated view of the build rates in the quarter and then the projection for where things are going in 2019, there\u2019s just caution. There\u2019s a revision down. It\u2019s not a huge step down, but it\u2019s a revision down in the first half of the year really driven by China, so I would say some additional slowing in the outlook for build rates in automotive. Electronics - you know, it held up well in the quarter, we had a good solid finish for that business. In fact, if you look at 2018, we were right in the range for what we were expecting in the electronics markets, and we had a cautious outlook as we went through the year. I think you see it with the OEMs in that market, they\u2019re signalling a cautious view, and it\u2019s more for first quarter than it was necessarily impacting Q4 of \u201918. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough, Mike. If I could follow up, Nick, just on price cost. You\u2019ve seen commodities come in a little bit as we ended the year, saw the raw mat headwind on the bridge, but maybe just talk a little bit about how much price do you think you\u2019ll be able to get in 2019, and are the pricing actions already in place for those benefits? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Joe, I would say much of 2018, as well as Q4, has played out exactly how we expected, that we expected fairly significant raw material headwinds that we\u2019ve been more than offsetting throughout the year with our selling price increases, so as I look backwards on \u201918, very much how we saw that happening.  As we look forward into 2019, we do see raw material and tariff headwinds continuing, just not at the same level of what we saw in 2018, so you see in our earnings bridge, we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of headwinds, and that\u2019s inclusive of tariffs. In November, when you were with us, I laid out that I expected that to be about $100 million headwind from tariffs. Right now, we put that at about $70 million year-on-year headwind from tariffs, and that\u2019s built into that $0.10 and $0.20, and we remain optimistic that selling prices will more than offset. The last part of that question, the vast majority of our price increases have already been enacted, either late in the second half of 2018 or ones that have already been announced that go into effect early this year, so much of it, if not all of it has already been actioned. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Nick, can you talk about what happened in safety and graphics in terms of the 22% margin you report in the quarter? You mentioned some fourth quarter actions and weakness in roofing granules impacting margin, but margin was obviously lower than last year\u2019s Q4 despite now lapping Scott Safety, so how much of the fourth quarter actions were unusual and would you expect margin going forward to be up significantly in \u201919 versus \u201918? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Andy, one of the first things you should do is just look at--we had a noticeable gain in fourth quarter last year on the sale of our electronic monitoring business within safety and graphics. That\u2019s why we\u2019re explaining that the underlying margin, once we pull that gain out, is down 110 basis points. The two primary things driving that 110 basis point margin contraction, one is that decline in roofing granules, and then we\u2019ve also--as you know, we\u2019ve acquired the Scott Safety business. We continue to take actions to integrate that. We\u2019ve been taking a number of actions, and that continued integration of Scott Safety is the second contributing factor to the margin contraction. Overall, we\u2019re extremely pleased with Scott Safety\u2019s performance, high growth in the quarter, and very pleased with the contribution it\u2019s making to our safety and graphics business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to healthcare, 4% growth in oral care is the best you\u2019ve recorded in some time there, and China growth is obviously strong in healthcare. Do easier comps in drug delivery mean that the lumpiness really that we saw in \u201918 is probably behind 3M and that the confidence level in your 3 to 5% organic growth in healthcare for \u201919 is reasonably high? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Andy, I think it\u2019s still going to be lumpy in 2019, and that\u2019s primarily going to be driven by comps to what we saw in 2018. For the full year, we\u2019re not anticipating that drug delivery in total is going to have a noticeable impact on healthcare\u2019s growth, but as I look at the seasonality of what we\u2019re staring into of comps in drug delivery, we will see it being negative in the first half of the year and likely positive in the second half of the year. Michael Roman : Andy, let me clarify - negative comps from drug delivery. We\u2019re not seeing the healthcare business negative in the first half. Andrew Kaplowitz : Right, but overall the rest of the business does seem reasonably solid, and you would say you have pretty good visibility into the rest of the business, including the new product intros that you\u2019ve got in oral care starting to impact that business? Michael Roman : Correct, yes. Andrew Kaplowitz : All right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Maybe a quick one on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of channel inventory levels and if we\u2019re all still normal, or if you\u2019re seeing anything different across any of your businesses. Michael Roman : John, I would say we came out of Q4 pretty balanced across the businesses in channel. It\u2019s something we watch very closely - you know, we\u2019re watching sell-in, sell-out, and it looks to be pretty balanced. I would say with a word of caution around the end markets that are slowing - that always puts a focus on channel, so when you look at what\u2019s going on automotive and electronics, we\u2019re watching that closely and making sure that we have a good view of what\u2019s going on there. But as we exited \u201918, it looked to be a pretty good balance, and that\u2019s not just true of those specific end markets but across broader industrial and even across the consumer business as well. John Walsh : Got you. Maybe just drilling down into one of those specifically, because every once in a while it kind of does get called out, is on the automotive repair and refinish. Obviously there was some channel consolidation there - that all seems to be behind the business, I just wanted to kind of confirm that. Michael Roman : Yes, I think what I said about the broader industrial is true for automotive aftermarket as we come out of \u201918 as well - pretty balanced across the channel. That said, what we called out there, the consolidation, that\u2019s something that is ongoing. We saw a significant impact as we went through the first part of the year. I think that\u2019s something that can continue, so that\u2019s another one of those impacts on channel inventory that we watch as we see consolidation. But coming out of the year, pretty balanced in automotive aftermarket as well. John Walsh : Got you. Maybe one more specific to the businesses here. With the acquisitions you\u2019re done, personal safety now by sub-business is one of your larger exposures. Obviously I think you said organic was up 7. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there and if you think that kind of momentum can continue to carry on? Michael Roman : If you think about personal safety, it\u2019s been a leader for us in growth over the last two years - \u201917 and \u201918, both strong growth, and that\u2019s really, I think, a testament to the organic priorities that we put there and the leading position that we\u2019ve been able to develop organically, and then also the acquisitions that have complemented that portfolio well. It positions us well in the marketplace where the growth is happening, and so we continue to see leading growth for the company and we have a very strong portfolio and position for our customers. I expect--you know, it\u2019s a larger business and it\u2019s a very strong contributor to our growth as we move ahead, so I expect it to continue to lead in its market. John Walsh : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up if there was any extra color you\u2019d give on how the year is starting out in Q1 versus either sales ranges laid out on Slide 17 or else the earnings bridge items on Slide 20 - things like FX, hedging . I\u2019m not sure how that plays out through the year. On the revenue side in particular, just wondering how confident you are in Q1 that APAC and the EMEA regions can both see positive growth. Nicholas Gangestad : Julian, so far what we\u2019re seeing as a start to this year is very much in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve laid out. Just in terms of how we ended 2018, I\u2019d say as we went through the quarter, things were very much in line with what we were expecting. The only color I\u2019d put is we probably saw some weakening in China as the quarter went on. Now in terms of 2019 and our guidance and what we\u2019re expecting there, things that can impact quarter by quarter, foreign exchange, and I\u2019ll talk this on an EPS basis, we think that\u2019s going to be neutral for the year given where the currencies are, if they stay there, and given our hedging position. I will note that it will be a headwind in the first half of the year, particularly in Q1, and then a tailwind to us in the second half of 2019.  Other things to note, we expect margin expansion throughout the year, full year. Based on our guidance, it pencils out to about 100 basis point margin expansion, and tax rate, the tax rates we expect by quarter, we\u2019re guiding 20 to 22%. I\u2019d expect to see the first quarter closer to the low end of that range and then the other quarters closer to the midpoint or high end of that range. Then as far as growth that you were asking about, right now our view is we see pretty much all the areas lining up with the ranges that we\u2019ve laid out. I think in the case of China and Asia, where we\u2019re guiding low to mid single digits, if anything I\u2019d expect the first quarter to be the more challenged of those and then progressively better, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much out of the range that we\u2019ve just laid out here, quarter by quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, Nick. My follow-up question would just be around some of the various cost levers in the P&L. You\u2019d stated that operating margins should be up about 100 basis points for 2019 overall. I\u2019m guessing R&D may be a slight headwind, R&D to sales coming up, so how do we think about the delta on gross margin versus SG&A? I ask particularly because you had very, very good SG&A control in the second half of the year in particular. Is that a one-time but then needs to step back up in SG&A to sales in \u201919, or is it a function of productivity and business mix changes so it\u2019s sustainable? Nicholas Gangestad : Julian, if I break it into the three components you\u2019re asking about, we do see our R&D expense as a percent of revenue going up in 2019. We see our gross margin improving and we see our SG&A percent to revenue going down, so that margin expansion is going to be coming from both gross margin improvements and SG&A productivity. The gross margin improvements, some of that has been going from our transformation, some of it is coming from our footprint actions that we\u2019ve been actioning over the last couple of years, and then on the SG&A front it\u2019s our continued leverage of the productivity through our transformation efforts, that we\u2019ll be continuing to expand margin on that front. Julian Mitchell : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. A couple small questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, how do you get Scott Safety to grow 10%? I mean, Tyco tried for a long time and I don\u2019t think they ever had a quarter anywhere close to that type of growth. Is it as simple as just plugging into your distribution system, or is there something more to it? Michael Roman : Yes, I think Scott Safety, it goes back to what I was talking about with the safety business in general. When we\u2019re bringing together those complementary portfolios, it\u2019s been a really, I think, a win-win for us as we\u2019ve integrated the teams together, that we can go out with leading solutions and combine those, and that\u2019s having a noticeable impact. It\u2019s certainly energized the teams and it\u2019s had some impact on the business. I think we had a number of projects come together in Q4 - that was part of it as well, so we certainly saw positive timing impacting it, but we are seeing a lift from having our leading personal safety portfolio combining with Scott Safety and Capital Safety, for that matter, and bringing those into the marketplace together. Scott Davis : That makes sense. As a follow-up, I\u2019m just curious on the cadence of cost-out on the ERP. When you deploy--when you get 70% done, how long before you can cut the cord on the duplicate spend? There\u2019s obviously some duplicate spend for a while until you are 100% comfortable going with that new ERP system. Is that a material change in cadence through the year of cost-out into 2020? Nicholas Gangestad : Scott, I wouldn\u2019t call it a material change throughout the year. I\u2019d call it a continued progression of what we were seeing in \u201918 into \u201919, so there\u2019s not going to be one significant triggering event; but every quarter, additional productivity as we realize those benefits, as we ensure that our supply chain is functioning as we expected, as we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, as we continue to work through those things, we continue to see more and more SG&A opportunity for benefits, but not a cliff. It will just continue to evolve over the next couple years. Michael Roman : Scott, maybe to add to that, we have a value realization map, and as we deploy and we stabilize, we get benefits from that as we take better advantage of our service models that we put in place, we get benefit. But we\u2019re also--you know, we talked about this in the investor day, really doubling down on leveraging the new capabilities we have, and that gives you a steady opportunity to drive productivity. That\u2019s what I think you\u2019ll see, and that\u2019s the next point - it\u2019s going to be a steady progression as we take full advantage of the capabilities that we\u2019re putting in place. Scott Davis : Fair enough. Good luck and thank you, fellows. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning everyone. A little chilly for you guys this morning, I see too. Michael Roman : A little bit. Deane Dray : Glad everyone made it in. For Nick, it looks like free cash flow - yes, you\u2019re above 100% for the fourth quarter, but it did lag your historical fourth quarter conversion pretty significantly. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes there, please? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, as part of what I\u2019ve shared before, we in 2018 built inventory in anticipation of some of our go-lives for our business transformation ERP deployments, and as we\u2019ve progressed throughout the year, one of the more significant things is that that extra inventory that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s been impacting our cash flow. It\u2019s one of the things that we are starting to see change in the fourth quarter, and our expectation as we guide 95 to 105% free cash flow conversion in 2019, the expectation that we make even more significant improvements on that going through \u201919. So working capital is the biggest thing I\u2019ll call out there, that we see that it\u2019s one of our biggest places for opportunity in our free cash flow conversion. Deane Dray : Got it. Then one of the businesses that had a soft spot in the third quarter was office retail, but I see it swung into one of the growth areas this quarter. Could we just drill down for a bit on office retail, maybe address ecommerce and expectations in 2019? Michael Roman : Deane, this has been an evolving story and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the channel and the restructuring that\u2019s going on there. We see it as a sell-in, sell-out kind of story. Even through that transformation, we were seeing sell-out for our portfolio still being positive. We were seeing negative sell-in as we saw the restructuring of the channel and inventory coming out. Certainly ecommerce is another growth platform for that portfolio and we continue to do very well there in that category - it\u2019s a strong growth driver for that business, so as we came through \u201918, we started to see the balance between sell-out and sell-in come a little closer, so we saw some positive growth on the sell-in, and again the sell-out remaining still strong. So as we get into \u201919, the story will be what additional structure or changes will happen in the channel, how does that shift. We\u2019re going to continue to be focused on the end user and driving that demand and driving that sell-out, and I think we\u2019ll continue to drive positive growth from that over the long run. Deane Dray : Got it. Just a last quick question - your comment on the air quality improvement in China caught me a little bit by surprise, but I see news reports now real significant improvement, especially in Beijing. Is that going to be a recurring theme, because you\u2019ve got some tough comps in that business throughout that you\u2019ll be looking at in 2019. Michael Roman : Deane, we certainly had some tough comps as we came through the second half of \u201918, and with an improvement in air quality you saw that play out as part of the slowing that we saw in China in the second half of the year and impacted those businesses related to it as well. When we go into \u201919, we still see some comp in the first half of the year, but it gets a little more normalized and it will depend on what happens to air quality as we move ahead, does it continue to see an improvement. But the base for it gets more in line with what we saw in \u201918 as we go through \u201919. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good morning. Can we just help calibrate, perhaps with some numbers, what could happen here in the first quarter? I mean, I hear a lot of commentary from you guys and from everybody - obviously it\u2019s more of a macro thing, about things slowing towards the end of the quarter, and then into the first quarter you had a couple electronics guys who really saw a fall-off towards the end of the quarter and into the first, and you said it\u2019s not going to be too different but kind of sounding like it\u2019s toward the low end of the range year-over-year. I mean, are we talking about basically of a--will you grow organically in the first quarter at the low end of that range, is that what you\u2019re saying? Nicholas Gangestad : Steve, I would not be surprised if in the first half of the year, partially based on comps, we\u2019re in the lower half of the range, and in the second half of the range we\u2019re in the upper half of the range. Much of what we have is lined up that way. I don\u2019t see us in negative growth territory in any quarter. The second quarter, the only reason I say that, Steve, is we noted in second quarter last year that we felt there was some pull ahead of revenue from third quarter into second quarter, so we\u2019ll be facing into that comp second quarter of this year. Steve Tusa : That makes a lot of sense. Your normal seasonality is up low double digit from 4Q to 1Q. Should we think about that as a little bit lower organic offset by lower tax, or is the organic enough to kind of make first quarter a bit less of a seasonal performance? Nicholas Gangestad : I think taxes typically--our first quarter is typically our lowest tax expense. I do see it a bit more normalized of tax expense if you look quarter by quarter. If you look at 2018, our tax expense in the first quarter was noticeably below the range. I don\u2019t see that happening in first quarter of \u201919 - I think it will be in the range, but closer to the low end. Then the other piece, Steve, as I mentioned, FX will be a bit of an abnormal pattern throughout the year, that it will be a headwind to us in the first half, in particular in the first quarter, and then it will be offsetting and flipping, and that\u2019s primarily driven by hedging that we\u2019re seeing. We had hedging losses in 2018, and if currencies stay where they are, they\u2019ll be flipping to hedging gains in 2019. Steve Tusa : And how big are those gains for \u201919? Nicholas Gangestad : We had hedging losses of approximately a little over $80 million in 2018, and if currencies stayed where they are, they\u2019d be in the $50 million, $60 million, $70 million of gains right now. Steve Tusa : One last quick one for you guys on portfolio management. This year, you\u2019re kind of flipping the portfolio around a little bit. It seems like it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, this kind of $0.15 headwind. I know some of it is temporary, but is that kind of--should we be ready for a bit of year one dilution as you work through--you know, as you continue to work through the portfolio on an annual basis, or does it all catch up towards the end because I know that you\u2019ve guided to positive, ultimately positive benefits over the long term, but obviously this year is a bit of a negative. How should we think about that in the context of the long term guide on portfolio management? Nicholas Gangestad : If I use MModal as an example, that one we see as a $0.10 headwind this year that\u2019s driven by some of our transaction costs one time, some of our integration costs at the beginning of our time of owning it, as well as some ongoing amortization. This particular one, we guided that we think by year three it will be about 10 times--that this would equate to a 10 times EBITDA, so it will be generating $100 million-plus of EBITDA by year three. I\u2019d say that\u2019s not uncommon of what to expect, that often in the first year we want to aggressively integrate whatever we buy into the company to be fully realizing the value model that we can create by having it part of 3M. Steve Tusa : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Maybe to start out, Nick, can you talk about what some of the offsetting factors are in guidance? I guess if I add up pension, MModal, and then the lower organic growth, it seems like a bit more than what you\u2019ve tweaked the range by. You mentioned that the tariff headwind was a little lower. Is there anything else in the bridge that we should be aware of as being an offsetting item? Nicholas Gangestad : In terms of what we were anticipating back in November, those three things you just called out, Josh, those would all be tweaks down. As far as tweaks up since November, we\u2019re seeing a less negative environment for raw material prices, that if I had called out specifically back in November what we were expecting for raw material headwinds, I would have been quoting a higher number there, and that\u2019s partially offsetting some of these tweaks down that I\u2019ve laid out. That\u2019s the single biggest one that\u2019s changed. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just as an exporter, did you see any of your customers in the fourth quarter do any pre-buy work when January was still kind of a target date for tariffs? We\u2019ve seen some of that in some other short cycle guys, curious if that impacted you at all. Michael Roman : Josh, we watch that closely and it\u2019s part of what we look at in the channel - you know, when we see these macro changes, are they impacting the pre-buy. We didn\u2019t see that as we came through the quarter, and as Nick said, the quarter progressed the way we expected. It\u2019s not just watching from a distance - we\u2019re close with those partners, and we didn\u2019t have any indication of that happening, certainly not at any significant level. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, appreciate it. Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Good morning everybody. So Europe, Western Europe flat, how much of that was self-inflicted by your own actions to withdraw from certain product lines and markets versus the actual market, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to quantify it, but how does that spill into the 2019 outlook as well? Is there a way to quantify that? Nicholas Gangestad : John, I\u2019d estimate that there\u2019s about 200 basis points of us taking specific actions of adjusting our portfolio, of product lines that we\u2019re choosing to exit that are built into that. There will be some carry-forward of that into \u201919, but not on as a significant level as what we saw in 2018. John Inch : Nick, are you still on track to get to the 20% margins in Europe? I forget exactly what you said in November, what your timeline was, but how is that tracking? Is that ahead of schedule, or just on track? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, we\u2019re on track to do that, John. 2019 will be a noticeable year where we\u2019ve done a number of things in \u201917 and \u201918 to set us up for that. \u201919 will be a year of seeing noticeable margin improvement to get us on track to that 20% by 2020. John Inch : Twenty percent by 2020 - okay. Then there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here to this guide. I understand why you took the lower end of the range down a point, but the midpoint if you adjust for MModal really only declines by $0.05, which I guess you could argue that\u2019s the impact of half a point, but there must be some other things. I\u2019m curious - specifically on raw materials, I get what you\u2019re saying; on the other hand, Nick, didn\u2019t you say that tariffs would be fully offset, and versus November, this raw material productivity, the minus-$0.20 to minus-$0.10, is that actually lower, because obviously things like oil and other things have actually declined, so just trying to calibrate why, even though you lowered the guide where only the midpoint is $0.05 lower, is any of this being offset because raw materials are, while still a headwind, slightly better? If that makes sense. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, if I had shown this, what we expected it look like in November, I would have been showing a higher raw material headwind there as we\u2019ve seen with oil and some of the things that we were expecting on tariffs haven\u2019t turned out quite as bad as what we were estimating. Back in November I said we were confident that we could more than offset whatever we see with raw materials and tariffs with our selling prices, and we remain, I\u2019d say, even more confident on that front. John Inch : Then just lastly, Nick, how did the semicon piece of 3M do specifically? Remind us, is that about a billion dollars? I know consumer electronics is around 2. Did semicon--was it seeing the weakness particularly in Asia that a lot of these companies are calling out, or did you do better; and if you did better actually, why do you think that\u2019s the case? Michael Roman : John, maybe I\u2019ll take that. If you look at the business, our electronic materials business has got the semiconductor piece of it. It\u2019s not the largest piece of that. When you look at that, we\u2019ve got other businesses in there. We\u2019ve got materials into consumer electronics, we have assembly solutions, but a big portion of it goes into semicon. We certainly expected to see some slowing as we went through the quarter. As Nick talked about, they were in line, that business was in line with the overall 3% growth that we saw in the quarter. Going forward, there\u2019s more caution in that marketplace and the semiconductor manufacturers are part of that, so I would say it was less of an impact on Q4 but more of part of the caution as we guide going into \u201919. John Inch : Understood, got it. Thanks guys, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Hi, two quick ones. Could you characterize what you\u2019re seeing in Latin America in a little bit more detail, like where the pockets of strength are, and can you speak a little bit more broadly about in 2019 - 2020 what kind of impact you may see on 3M from emerging market customers realigning their supply chains to work around the current tariff disputes? Michael Roman : Laurence, talking about Latin America first, we saw broader based growth in Latin America across our portfolio, both Brazil and Mexico, the largest countries there, performing well as we came through Q4. It was pretty balanced and pretty broad-based in portfolio and growth, and we have that same kind of outlook as we look to 2019.  To your question about the supply chain and are we seeing changes there, it\u2019s certainly something we watch for. We expect the supply chain to react over time as tariffs come into play. We haven\u2019t seen a significant impact to that at this point - it just hasn\u2019t shown up that way. We watch it closely with the customer and we\u2019re connected with them on the design and specification of our products, and that includes pretty good visibility on the supply chain. We just haven\u2019t seen it react that strongly to this point. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning, and thanks for going long here. Can you hear me okay? Michael Roman : Yes. Nigel Coe : Good. I\u2019m having some problems with the phones here, so I\u2019m on a cell phone. Just want to go back to the electronics outlook for zero to 4, and obviously you\u2019ve provided some [indiscernible] in terms of quarterly cadence. If we dig into the businesses, electronics business, energy, are you seeing any appreciable difference in the two sub-segments for \u201919? Michael Roman : Nigel, you\u2019re talking about the sub-segments of energy, or you\u2019re talking about energy versus electronics? Nigel Coe : Energy versus electronics, and looking at that 2% midpoint, how would that break out between the two sub-segments. Michael Roman : Yes, we highlighted the good performance from energy markets in Q4, and we have an outlook for that to continue as we go into 2019, so I would say that is more of the same. The electronics, we\u2019ve been coloring that all morning based on the outlook in the end markets, so I would say that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re a little more cautious about. Energy looks pretty stable as we go into the year, but both of them contributing, I would say, evenly across the year, with that kind of caution on the end markets in play. Nigel Coe : Okay. Is there any appreciable difference in the margin profile between energy and electronics? I\u2019ve always assumed electronics was higher margins, but could you clarify that? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Nigel, there\u2019s really not a discernible difference between the margins in the different components there, between our electronics and our energy. They\u2019re very similar, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Okay. Then Nick, if you could just quickly clarify the comments you made on safety and graphics margins for 4Q. You called out Scott Safety integration headwinds, but then we\u2019re comping against some of the purchase accounting headwinds in 4Q17, so I\u2019m just wondering why we wouldn\u2019t have seen a benefit from Scott Safety in 4Q18. Nicholas Gangestad : When I\u2019m backing out last year, there were one-time costs with Scott, bringing them in, as well as the gain that we had on the sale of our electronic monitoring business. When I go and say it\u2019s 110 basis point underlying margin contraction, that\u2019s already discounting for that piece. Now that we\u2019ve taken that out and it\u2019s part of our ongoing business, we are continuing to take actions in Scott and other parts of our safety and graphics business, but Scott\u2019s the largest one that we\u2019re taking actions on. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s behind that.  The other piece that I maybe didn\u2019t highlight clearly enough for you, Nigel, is the sales decline that we\u2019re seeing in roofing granules, that is creating a year-on-year margin contraction in safety and graphics that\u2019s impacting that total. Nigel Coe : Understood, thanks Nick. Operator : That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Michael Roman : Thank you. In summary, the fourth quarter capped another year of significant accomplishments for 3M as we posted good results while strengthening our company for the long term. Moving ahead, we are focused on executing our four priorities and delivering for our customers and shareholders in 2019. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 25, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you to mark your calendars for upcoming earnings calls on July 25, and October 24.  Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular measures which exclude the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and significant litigation-related charges. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was a disappointing start to the year for 3M. We continued to face slowing in several key end markets, which impacted both growth and margins, and our operational execution fell short of the expectations we have for ourselves. Today I will lay out a number of aggressive actions we are taking to drive productivity, reduce costs and improve cash flow, as we manage through challenges in some of our end markets. In addition, I will provide an update on two litigation issues that affect affected our results. And provide updated guidance for the full year. I will also discuss the realignment of our business groups that we announced last month which will enable even greater growth and operational efficiency. Please turn to slide 5 for a summary of our first quarter numbers. Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%, lower than we anticipated. We saw end market softness in China, Automotive and Electronics, which we have discussed throughout the quarter. We also faced channel inventory adjustments, which negatively impacted several of our businesses. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.23 per share down 11% year-over-year. This excludes significant litigation charges related to the PFAS and respirators, which I will discuss later in my remarks. Underlying margins were 21% in the quarter, down 160 basis points with adjusted income of $1.7 billion. Our earnings and margin shortfall was due to a combination of two things. First negative organic growth in the quarter and the second weak productivity, especially in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. As the actions we took were not sufficient to offset the broad-based softening we faced in those markets as the quarter progressed. Please turn to slide 6. We are moving quickly to strengthen our performance and address the challenges we face and the actions on this slide are underway. First, we are reducing approximately 2,000 positions, through both voluntary and involuntary actions. Reductions will span all business groups, functions and geographies with emphasis on corporate structure and underperforming areas of the portfolio. On a pre-tax basis we will take a charge of approximately $150 million in 2019, and we expect annual savings of approximately $225 million to $250 million, with $100 million this year. Job reductions are never easy, but they are necessary to make us stronger and a more competitive enterprise as we move forward. Beyond restructuring, we are also driving cash flow by reducing inventory levels and accelerating actions on indirect costs. Importantly, while we take these actions we remain focused on our customers and balancing short term pressures with the long-term success of 3M. That is why we will continue our investments in growth, which includes research and development and our priority growth programs. This is a playbook we know how to execute and we are confident it will enable us to maximize value for shareholders as we work through the market slowdowns and our related actions, positioning us for strong growth as our markets recover. Please turn to slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, two significant litigation matters related to PFAS and respirators impacted our quarter and resulted in a total charge of $548 million or $0.72 per share. We increased our respiratory reserve by $313 million to address the costs of resolving all current and expected : coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia. We also established a PFAS reserve of $235 million to cover certain environmental matters and litigation related to the manufacture and disposal of PFAS at five 3M facilities, including three in the United States and two in Europe. This reserve does not include any product claims related to PFAS. We continue to work closely with the EPA and other regulatory bodies to support science-based regulations of these chemistries. We also continue to work with the communities we serve to ensure they can have confidence in the quality of their drinking water, additional details will be available in our upcoming 10-Q filing. Please turn to slide 8 for an update on our 2019 guidance. While we remain positive on the global macroeconomic environment, growth conditions in certain markets have been slower than anticipated going into the year. As a result, today we are updating our range for organic growth to minus one to the top plus 2%, against the prior range of one 1% to 4%. In addition, we anticipate adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share which includes the restructuring impact versus the previous range of $10.45 to $10.90. We now expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22% against the prior range of 22$ to 25%. We continue to anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. I'll come back to make some comments on our new business group alignment after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. Organic sales declined 1.1% in the first quarter, with volumes down 200 basis points and selling prices up 90 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales by 50 basis points. While foreign currency translation was an additional 3.4 percentage point headwind to sales. All-in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars decreased 5% versus last year. Geographically the U.S. declined 40 basis points organically, Consumer and Electronics and Energy grew low-single digits, while Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care declined. Asia Pacific was down 3.6% organically in Q1, impacted by the slowdown in China, Automotive and Electronics markets. Health Care delivered positive high single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy declined. Organic growth was down 4% in China/Hong Kong against an 11% comparison a year ago. Japan organic growth declined 7%, or excluding Electronics increased 2%. Latin America/Canada and EMEA each grew 1% organically in the quarter. Please turn to slide 10 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $7.9 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion and adjusted operating margins of 21.4%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Declines in organic volume and weak productivity reduced margins 180 basis points year-on-year. Productivity challenges were most pronounced in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by our acquisition of M Modal which closed in February. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to first quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 11 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $2.23 per share, down 11% year-over-year. As you see, a number of factors impacted first quarter earnings. Most significantly, negative organic growth and weak productivity reduced per share earnings by $0.19 in the quarter. This was notably different from our outlook in January. The rest of our EPS factors are in line with our original expectations. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced first quarter earnings by $0.07 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share headwind in the quarter. As expected, our underlying tax rate increased year-on-year, which reduced Q1 earnings $by $0.05. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding 4% versus Q1 last year, adding $0.09 to per share earnings. Please turn to slide 12 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was $657 million, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 74%, which includes a 24 percentage point benefit from the litigation-related charges. First quarter capital expenditures were $391 million, up $87 million year-on-year. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx investments in the range of 1.6 billion to $1.7 billion versus a prior range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. We increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $830 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $701 million in the quarter, and we continue to expect full year repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $4 billion. Please turn to slide 13, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. Please note additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation. As mentioned earlier, throughout the quarter we continued to see soft end market trends in China, Automotive and Electronics, along with channel inventory adjustments. These trends primarily impacted our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy businesses. Our Industrial business saw a broad-based slowdown across most of its portfolio, posting an organic sales decline of 2.8% to start the year. This slow organic growth within Industrial was most pronounced in our automotive business. Our automotive OEM business was down 9% year-on-year, impacted by a 6% decline in first quarter global car and light truck builds, along with channel inventory reductions, particularly in China. A positive note, advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high single digits.  On a geographic basis Industrial's organic growth was led by 1% increases in both Latin America/Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined 2% and Asia Pacific declined 8%. Industrial's first quarter operating margins were 20%, down 280 basis points, impacted by sales declines and weak productivity. Moving to Safety and Graphics, first quarter sales were flat organically against last year's 7% comparison. Personal Safety continued to deliver solid results in Q1, up 3% organically, while each of the other three businesses declined. Geographically, organic growth was led by Latin America/Canada and EMEA, each up 2%. Asia Pacific was flat, while the U.S. was down 3%. Safety and Graphics first quarter operating margins were 23.2%, down 380 basis points. The year-on-year operating margin decline included a negative 110 basis point impact from a gain on a divestiture last year, along with slow growth and weak productivity. Next our Health Care business was up 1% organically in the first quarter. Holding back growth in Health Care was the continued softness in our drug delivery business, down nearly 20% organically in the first quarter, which negatively impacted overall Health Care organic growth by nearly 2 percentage points. Organic growth was led by food safety, up high single digits followed by health information systems up mid-single digits, while medical solutions and oral care were each up low-single digits organically. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way up 7%, with EMEA up 3%. The U.S. declined 3% impacted by drug delivery. Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 28.1% which included a negative 230 basis point impact from the Q1 acquisition of M Modal. Shifting to the Electronics and Energy business, organic sales declined 3% in the first quarter. The Energy side of the business grew 5%, while the Electronics related businesses were down 6%, with declines in both display material systems and Electronics material solutions. Electronics related growth was impacted by soft end market demand in Consumer Electronics and factory automation, along with channel inventory adjustments. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S., while Asia Pacific declined 5%. First quarter operating margins were 23.8%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. Lastly, first quarter organic growth for the Consumer business was 1%. Sales grew in our home improvement business, up 3% organically, while home care and consumer health care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 3% increase in the U.S., with particular strength in our Filtrete and command brands. EMEA declined 1% as we continued to adjust our portfolio in this region and Asia Pacific declined 3% impacted by lower Consumer demand for respiratory solutions. Consumer's operating margins were 19.5% in the first quarter. That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to slide 14, and I'll hand it back over to Mike to discuss the business group realignment. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Nick. Earlier I laid out actions we are taking to address our near-term challenges. At the same time we are continuing to build 3M for the long run. Effective April 1, we moved from five to four business groups in order to better serve our customers and better align our businesses to their markets. The new business groups are organized around customers and go-to-market models and include Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. This realignment will enable us to accelerate growth, maximize value across the portfolio, and take greater advantage of our transformation progress. It will also further streamline the organization and help us achieve the 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion that we laid out last November as part of our five-year plan. We will start reporting results under this structure in the second quarter. Please turn to slide 15, and I will take you through our 2019 guidance for the new business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by Health Care with a range of 2% to 4%, followed by Consumer at 1% to 3%. Organic growth in Safety & Industrial is expected in the range of minus 1% to plus 2%, with Transportation & Electronics at minus 3% to flat. That wraps up our prepared remarks. In summary, while our recent performance is disappointing, our business model remains strong and we are making the necessary changes to accelerate 3M into a stronger future. Thank you. And we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Good morning, guys. Michael Roman : Morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on margins. I think the last time you had this kind of revenue decline, as I look at my model was sort of 4Q \u201815 and 1Q \u201816 and sort of the operating leverage impact was a lot less I think in 1Q \u201816 margins actually went up. So I'm just trying to understand what happened with the margin decline in the quarter and specifically also, as I look at the gross margin, what surprised me once again looking at my model, the last time you had gross margins that low I think was 4Q \u201908 or 1Q \u201809, so that\u2019s very odd? Thank you. Michael Roman : Thank you, Andrew. Maybe I\u2019ll l start and I'll ask Nick to give some more detailed comments. The two drivers of that, one is the organic growth and the organic growth as we talked about was led by China, Automotive and Electronics, which are strong gross margin businesses for us globally. So that was one of the contributing factors. And then the adjustments that came in the channel, along with that slowing growth in those markets, that drove challenges for us in productivity in the plants. And we took actions to adjust our production levels and our costs there, but we didn't get ahead of it. So those were a couple of the big contributor really driven off of that slowing the majority of that slowing from those end markets Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Andrew, a couple things to add in there. As we were going through the quarter and seeing lower volumes and we of course adjusted the output coming out of our factories. So for the first quarter, compared to the first quarter last year, we were seeing the output in our factories down between 4% and 5%. Unfortunately we did not pull spending down proportionately. Our spending was down about 1% in our factories during that time. And that had a negative impact on our margin. Also on the - in there was the impact of a bit of a geographic mix, if you look at where we make higher margins and lower margins, the declines that we saw in Asia Pacific had an outsized impact on our margin this quarter. Michael Roman : Andrew, I would also add, we - as I said in my speech, we didn't respond aggressively enough to what we were seeing. And so we\u2019re behind the curve as we came through the quarter. That's why we're stepping in aggressively with the actions that we are\u2026 Andrew Obin : Let me ask the question maybe another way. We were surprised I think the Asia top line growth was fairly well telegraphed, maybe Japan surprised a little bit, but it's North American decline that also surprised me. And you continued sort of - you did note weak productivity in North America multiple times. And I was just wondering, how much - and I know we sort of finished the customer-facing ERP rollout. Can you just give us an update? Are you rolling out on the factories your key factories in North America, are you rolling ERP on the manufacturing floor, and is that disruptive? Thank you. Michael Roman : Andrew, just to update on the ERP, we've actually been very pleased with the success that we've had in the deployment in the U.S., and it has been around the businesses and not deployed to the factory level at this point. It's improving every month in our performance and what we can deliver to our customers. So that's been something that's been going well for us. When you look at the U.S., the growth, - organic growth in the U.S. was led by Industrial business, and really the automotive OEM and aftermarket businesses. There are some pockets in Safety & Graphics. And so the same kind of comments I had is as we saw slowing growth and some of the channel reactions, our production levels and our productivity didn't get ahead of it, and that was an important part of what we saw in the U.S. There are some other pockets. There are some pockets in Health Care with drug delivery in the U.S. that also contributed to that. But that gives you the background in the U.S. Andrew Obin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Michael Roman : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So I'm just thinking about the organic growth guide for the year of minus one to plus two, obviously slower start towards the low end to start the year. I guess, I'm just \u2013 as I'm thinking about, how you guys actually get towards that higher end of the range as we progress through the year. I'm just curious like did trends get any better as we exited the quarter? I know comps get tougher as we progress through the year. I'm just trying to like put some context around that guidance for the year? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. So Joe maybe I'll start. The \u2013 it was led by the markets that we called out and the channel reaction to some of that. That doesn't end up being an all year action. That is something that happens pretty quickly. So we don't see that necessarily be a contributor as we go through the year. And some \u2013 we do see some outlook for improvements in those markets. Health Care we have talked about challenge, we see with drug delivery being a headwind for us in the first half of the year and that gets better as we go through the year. Consumers basically at the bottom end of their range and the sellout remain strong. And in Safety and Graphics, we have a couple of pockets there. Our personnel safety business is off to a strong start to the year. And so up mid-single digits or low- to mid-single digits and we expect that to continue. The other pockets are more project delays in particular businesses and we expect those to improve as we go through the year. So it's really taking a look at each of those businesses and the guidance that we gave to those fits with Q1 and then where we see the rest of the year. Michael Roman : And Joe on the comp issue consistent with what we've been saying we see second quarter as our toughest comp and third quarter as our easiest comp and that's primarily driven by the what we had talked about a year ago as far as the timing of revenue related to our U.S. ERP go live. So we saw almost 6% organic growth in second quarter last year followed by 1.3% in the third quarter. So those are the two where we see the comps differentiating. All-in we saw the \u2013 we saw and we continue to see the first half as a slightly tougher comp for us than in the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up just on the margins for a second. So taking a look at your gross margins for the quarter. It's hard for me to go back into history and see a time where gross margins were down as much year-over-year. And Nick you referred to it a little bit when you responded to the lower growth environment in your response from a cost-out perspective at the factory level. I just want to understand that a little bit better because it's just historically this hasn't part of the hallmark of how you guys have executed. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Joe. Just one thing I think I need to make sure is clear with you and with everyone. In the gross margin on a GAAP basis is $235 million charge related to PFAS. So in the numbers that you're seeing there on our GAAP results, not all of that hit SG& A other 235 of that is recorded in gross margin. And Andrew that may go back to your earlier question too. So that's maybe when you're looking at our GAAP results the one thing you're seeing. That said, we still saw declines in our gross margin percentage, primarily driven by what I just talked about at the lower volumes not offset with commensurate declines in spending. Pulling out the PFAS charge we saw are underlying gross margin decline about 100 basis points. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael Roman : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Nick, you mentioned productivity is the issue, a big issue in Industrial in North America and Asia Pacific. If we go back over time industrial has been a segment where 3M has consistently struggled to grow margin and obviously productivity we talked about was worse in Q1. So could you talk about the transformation helping North America? I know you mentioned it's helping, but it's hard to see. I mean can you talk about your confidence that you can improve productivity in the quarters, especially in North America and Europe where you've talked about an expectation of big margin improvement going forward. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. So Andy, when you look at Industrial there's a couple of things around productivity that we're focused on. And the first one is it is getting in line with the growth that we see in the business. And automotive OEM, automotive aftermarket those are challenged end markets that we're especially aggressive getting on top of and in terms of our productivity. But it's more broad than that because -- especially in the U.S. we are a net exporter out of the U.S. and we do support business around the world and in particular in Asia. And so we're impacted by a broader softness in those markets as well. So it's a bigger productivity challenge in particular in the U.S. but in Industrial more broadly. And so the actions that we're focused on they're targeting that, getting ahead of the curve so to speak. And then it's taking advantage of all the other things that we've talked about the levers for creating greater value. And Business Transformation is a big one of those. Now we haven't deployed that in the U.S. into the plants. But we've made good progress with the go live, since the go live of last year and we continue to see good benefits and value coming out of the ERP deployment in Canada and EMEA. And our margins more broadly including industrial has been improving there and in part because of what we're doing in Business Transformation. So that's going to be an important lever as we move ahead. But the near term is getting ahead of the impact of the slowing end markets and the channel and getting our productivity in line. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay Mike. And maybe shifting gears. Can you talk about the cadence of your business performance through the quarter and what you've seen to the extent that you can talked about in April. Theoretically, there's been more enthusiasm in places like China given an increase in our tax cuts that could help markets like China auto or electronics. So have you seen any improvements in any of your short cycle businesses over the last few weeks or a month or two? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, Andy, certainly as we went through first quarter we talked a bit about the slowing that we saw as it went through the quarter and that continued right through the end of the quarter. And really, led by those markets, China automotive, electronics. So those are all the ones we've been talking about. There is \u2013 I think the outlook is, that gets better. When you listen to the projections and the economic projections in those areas, we haven't seen that. Our April is basically on track with what we're laying out for our total year guidance. But seeing a market improvement in those markets, I think, we'll see \u2013 we'll get an answer as we move further into the quarter, into the second quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Michael Roman : Good morning, John. John Inch : Good morning, guys. Mike, you opened the call talking about you, sort of, were positive \u2013 remain positive on a global macro. But I'm trying to understand, maybe, back to Andy's question, there are a degree of evidence, right, that electronics markets in Asia, maybe even China and China auto and so forth, are bottoming. Why you would you take the 2,000 hedge action now? I mean, are you implicitly signaling that you actually don't think that there is going to be much of an improvement in the foreseeable future? Or is this kind of a catch-up from something you should have been doing before and you were just hopeful things were not going to kind of fall apart to the degree they have? Michael Roman : Yes. John, so your point about the global macro is right. There is an expectation that there will be a broader growth in the global macro and maybe a bit slower as we come through the year in terms of global industrial production in particular. In the markets that we're talking about, they certainly have been slowed. But people have a view that it gets better as we get into the second half. I think, to a degree it's realigning ourselves. The actions we're taking is realigning ourselves with what we see in the market and what we've been working through as we come through for sure, kind of, the end of Q4 or end of Q1. If the markets recover, we \u2013 this is our playbook. When we see a slowdown, we realign our costs, we realign our operations, we take some targeted restructuring action and then we're in a good position to lead out. So I think this aligns us with what we today, really what we need to do in order to deliver on our commitments and then positions us to lead out of it. And so, if we do see that improvement in the second half, we'll be well positioned to lead out, even with these actions that we're taking. John Inch : In other words, you don't have to hire people back if things turn? Is that what you... Michael Roman : No, I think, we're aligning ourselves as we go forward, taking advantage of some of the things that we're doing to \u2013 with business transformation to leverage that. So this is \u2013 it's never easy to do this. And it is \u2013 you're asking question around something that we think very hard about. And I really am taking on very personally, we've got to think about what do we need to do near term and position ourselves for the long term. And we're going to continue to invest in growth into R&D and R&D growth programs and priority growth opportunities more broadly. So we're making sure to make this restructuring and realignment targeted to what we what we have to manage through. And so, will we need to hire people in the future? Yes, of course. As we go forward we will, where we see the opportunities and we'll invest. But in the near term, we've got to realign ourselves to be ready to deliver on those statements. John Inch : Got it. I want to shift gears to PFAS. If you go by the K, the litigation over the past couple of years definitely seems to be rising. There's a lot of reasons that people have potentially thrown out. First, I want to confirm that you do not have insurance in any context to pay for any of these litigation costs. I think the 850 to Minnesota was paid out of cash, right? And then the second thing is could you guys just give us a sense of what exactly is your playbook for dealing with this? Are you just going to litigate concurrently? Or are you going to try and bundle this and deal with it? I just -- it's hard to know from where we stand right why this isn't potentially an asbestos round two that unfortunately ended up bankrupting dozens of U.S. companies. And I don't think you're in that situation but anything you could say to that will be helpful. Nicholas Gangestad : Hey, John I'll just start talking about insurance and then I'll pass it over to Mike for your broader question. In regards to insurance and coverage for that for environmental claim such as PFAS, we do have places where we think we have insurance coverage and we are in discussions with insurance carriers regarding those matters. But that's going to take time for that to play out, John. That's -- don't look for that in the short-term for something to happen on that front. Michael Roman : Yes. And John just regarding the litigation activity. I mean, we are actively depending ourselves in all of this litigation. And it's difficult to know the timing and outcome of any particular litigation. And what we were able to do with the reserve this quarter is to really establish reserves that help us resolve the litigation that is related to environmental matters. And I would say litigation were a direct defendant around our manufacturing disposal. As I said in my comments, it is not covering any other product related PFAS litigation. And when you have the manufacturing in view where it's probable and estimable, the product litigation at this point that were defending ourselves against is not probable an estimable. And so we will update as appropriate and as we get some clarity on that. So it's really -- there are two different aspects of it there that we're managing. John Inch : Would it be fair to say this is going on for years. I don't see any a milestone event that potentially stops there. Is that a fair thing? It looks like the EPA is going to potentially come out with even more articulate regulations or guidelines or something like that. Michael Roman : Yes, and we continue to work with the EPA and other regulatory bodies on the foundation for the regulations that are being talked about and what will come. EPA, of course, announced a management plan for this and we're working with them to support where we go forward there. We actually are supportive of a federal approach here so we don't end up with a state-by-state approach that's different or patch work kind of approach. But it is something that is evolving and we'll continue to help be part of that with the EPA. And like I said, we'll update you on our litigation matters as appropriate. John Inch : Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Michael Roman : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Morning. Maybe a first question for Mike. So just trying to think about the last few months at 3M. You had the outlook meeting in November with some medium-term goals. Then you had a sort of re-segmentation more recently, and then today restructuring alongside another guidance reduction. So I understand that the restructuring and the guidance reduction, obviously, very closely linked. But I'm trying to understand what else has changed since that November meeting where it sounded like a case of steady-state high CapEx, high R&D the same segments. Then we heard the segments being changed. Now, the CapEx commitment seems to be wavering per the CapEx cut this morning. So, maybe just talk us through more broadly how your own thoughts about running and organizing and managing 3M have changed in the past few months. Michael Roman : Sure. And I'll go back to that in November Investor Day. I would say first of all, the realignment of the business group us was part of our thinking at that point. We weren't ready to announce it and implement it. There were things that we have to do to get ready for that. But it was part of -- even as I talked about, it's part of our expectations that will drive improvements of 200 to 300 basis points in our margin. And it really is set up to help us leverage best our business transformation and end-to-end streamline our connection to customers. So, it's part of the longer term strategy. As we came into the year, as we walk through the quarter -- even as we came in, we certainly acknowledge that we're seeing slowing in some of those key end markets. It got more severe as we go to our earnings call -- in the Q4 earnings call in January. As we went through February, we saw additional slowing and we're talking about it. And we were taking actions all along the way. We were doing things. We've been doing things along the way to adjust and address that slowing we are seeing, but we didn't get ahead of the curve. And so the restructuring and the other actions we're taking is to really do that now. So, it is -- I would say it's still rooted in that five-year plan and our commitment to investments and growth in R&D and the strategies that we talked about there is still very much part of it. The 3M model is strong. We've got to near-term execute and get in line with what we're seeing in these end markets. And that became kind of the new, I would say, set of actions that we had to step into and we're doing that. But again we know how to execute this playbook. We'll be rallying the team around us as we go through the next couple of days and I'm confident that we will step into it as we go ahead. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then my second question maybe around any updated thoughts on the portfolio. Should we view the re-segmentation as opening the door to any divestments? Does the guidance reduction make you think that maybe more portfolio pruning is needed? And on the other side of the ledger, should we expect more acquisitions now that M Modal has closed? Or is it more of a case of there are some internal things to fix, let's fix those first and think about M&A maybe next year? Michael Roman : Julian I'll start here as I always do. Organic growth is our first priority. So, we're going to continue to focus investments there as I said even as we go through this restructuring. But we still maintain flexibility to invest in the long-term value of the enterprise. And so acquisitions we have built strong capabilities to make acquisitions that fit with our fundamental strengths that fit in our most attractive markets. And we've been executing that. We still see that as a value driver for us in the future. And so we continue to stay active looking at acquisitions. We're going to continue to step into compelling acquisitions that leverage that strategy and capabilities that we have to create value. On the divestiture side, we've been actively managing a portfolio since 2012. And over the last three years, we've strengthened parts of our portfolio. It was a case we're always looking at how do we maximize the portfolio. And we're looking at businesses regardless of size on how we do we do that and how do we maximize value for the company and it's really around the fit with our fundamental strengths and we'll continue to actively manage it as we go forward. It's an ongoing process and we'll be focused on creating value with that as well. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Michael Roman : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just on the comment on inventory destocking, Mike and Nick, do you have a sense for what that might have cost you in the quarter? Nicholas Gangestad : Josh, so for the quarter we still built inventory. Josh Pokrzywinski : I mean, your customer's destocking. I'm sorry. Nicholas Gangestad : I'm sorry. I think it very easily could have impacted our total revenue by 100 basis points. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. Michael Roman : Josh just to give you a little color too. The automotive slowdown in China was one particular case where we saw significant impact in our growth from channel. And so where you see a slowdown in a particular market, like electronics or automotive it's accompanied with a change in inventory, everything from finished goods back through the value chain. And so that is a \u2013 that's clearly visible in those cases. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just pivoting back to an earlier question on some of the PFAS litigation, as a non-attorney this is maybe more obvious to other folks than myself. But given that you already have kind of one fight example in Minnesota with an 850 settlement. Is there a reason why adding the other four in there might not just be 850 times four. Is it kind of a easily digestible answer? Or is it a lot of hey it depends and there's a lot of differences? Michael Roman : Well, our manufacture footprint is different in every one of those sites and so that's part of it. But it really \u2013 I guess, if you can take from this is, it's not simply that \u2013 not simple math of multiplying times five. We've \u2013 we now define probable and estimable for the litigation that we face in those five sites as \u2013 with this reserve. So that is our \u2013 the way we have had determine what is estimable across that. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one last one on some of the re-segmentation. I understand this is not the quite the same thing as ERP was last year. But could we expect some sort of disruption to the customer side with some of the restructuring and re-segmentation being implemented? Thanks. Michael Roman : The realignment of the businesses is really \u2013 really the key focus for us was the customer and really aligning to them aligning to the customer segments and the type of customer and the go-to-market model. So we are actually \u2013 we've been moving towards this with some of the go-to-market model, capabilities that we've been putting in place and the way we leverage Business Transformation. This actually steps it forward even more. So I think this is not only focused on the customer I think the customers will see this as a positive step forward. And we'll see it as better aligned to them as we globally as we move ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael Roman : Hey, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I missed the very beginning intro comments. And we've touched on this channel inventory adjustment topic a couple of different times, with Josh's question just then. But can you just clarify how much was any kind of 4Q pull-in getting ahead of tariffs, getting ahead of price increases? And maybe you also had some of this ERP pull-in as well. How much of a factor is that in terms of this inventory adjustment? Michael Roman : Yes Deane we talked about a bit on our Q4 call. We saw the channel as well as balanced as we came into the year. We didn't see a pull-ahead in Q1 into Q4. The ERP impacts were largely Q2/Q3; we saw some tail of that into Q4. And it's hard to tell there may be a small tail as we come into this year as well which would be more playing out of some inventory. But that's a U.S. kind of view. The -- when I look at it, even as we went through the quarter, I would say Health Care channels are well balanced. We certainly saw our balance between sell-in, sell-out, and consumer. It was the Electronics and Automotive driven changes that really led to the channel impact. And maybe a few pockets in Safety and Graphics in areas like transportation where we had some project delays. But the bigger was in the Industrial and Electronics areas. So, that developed as the quarter went along and the response was very, very direct and we saw that in Q1. Deane Dray : Got it. And then on -- to go back to your comments about the lag in realigning your cost with the lower demand through the quarter. It would be interesting hearing from you about what was different about your response time. Is this -- just -- is this inherent to the 3M short cycle business? You just don't have that visibility; so therefore, you can't ramp down the cost structure that quickly. Does that put you at a disadvantage here in terms of the responsiveness? When you I look at decrimentals, companies that can ramp down costs quickly, typically will see a 25% decremental and you're well lower than that. So, it look like it did get away from you, but some color there will be helpful. Michael Roman : Yes. Deane we did take actions as we saw slowing growth. We're reducing production plants, we're adjusting demand plan. And we're trying to look ahead as much as we can into our customers get a clear view. And I would say in the direct businesses, we got a pretty clear view. It was a matter of how fast can we react. And we took actions in the end our volume that we produced went down in line obviously with our organic growth, but our costs didn't. And that was one of the challenges. And some of that is fixed cost some of that is variable costs and we need to do something on both of those. And so that's where the restructuring is targeting that. And that's not unusual in these situations in the industrial slowdown in 2015-2016; I face the same thing in leading that business and even in 2009. We have to take restructuring actions to really step into a bigger slowdown and in most particular markets that's what is taking here. And so the steps we took now we'll get ahead of the curve. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Michael Roman : Hey Scott. Scott Davis : Hi. I want to change gears a little bit because I think the -- I think most people at this point kind of get the issues. But I want to talk a little bit about R&D productivity and payback because just back the envelope, I don't think 3M historically has outgrown the Industrial group, in fact, it seemed to have undergrown some of the higher end peers out there and certainly spent a lot of money on R&D. Obviously there's a higher margin structure that is supported by that. But how do you fix that? How do you get the growth rate to really accelerate from these levels, which are really, basically just GDP type levels over time over really almost any time period you look at? Michael Roman : Yes, Scott, so you're right. Our investment in R&D and I would say innovation more broadly is fundamental to what we promised our investors and that is strong growth. Growth that outgrows the macro over our business cycles and deliver premium margins, deliver premium ROIC. And innovation is fundamental to that. In fact, it's the differentiator in our ability to do that. And I think in a quarter like this and even the cycle that we've been going through it's right to challenge our growth aspect of that. And what we are doing is really focused on that as well. And I would say this our capacity and our demonstrateability outgrow the macro over time has come from two important factors. One is our investment in innovation. Our ability to deliver new penetration opportunities with our innovation, new priority growth platforms as we talk about. And so those are very much a focus for us. It's also important that we do that in markets that are accretive to the macro that we're choosing. And that's our portfolio management. Make sure we're prioritizing in the most attractive market spaces. And so that is -- we often talked about the priorities organic growth in our capital allocation approximately 6% to sales and R&D and 4%, 5% to 5.5% in CapEx. But we prioritize that. It is really important that we prioritizing that and that's what we do to get that growth where we needed to be. And we did it in markets in that are most attractive. That's the focus. That\u2019s when I talk about continuing to invest in growth that's what I'm talking about. Scott Davis : Fair enough Mike. And when every add, I mean, you've been on board now you're not brand-new, but you're relatively new I think in comparison to many CEOs. And do you think you need to change the compensation scheme at all? Or is there something that as far as getting incentives more aligned with faster execution, because and I don't mean this to be mean. But if you go back really think about the 20 years or so I've covered your stock. 3M always seems to be a little bit behind on the restructuring curve almost never ahead. And even if you get this one right you're still behind. So do you need to change anything around the incentives or compensation scheme to get some of your leaders to move a little faster? Michael Roman : I think compensation is an important part of this. And we've updated and modified our compensation over time to do just what you're talking about to really align our leaders with what we need to deliver. And in particular, our promise to our investors, our organic growth, our EPS growth, our ROIC, our free cash flow. That is how they're aligned. They are aligned to the four promises. And were we -- should we take another look at that? I would say that's our normal course for us. We're going to take stock of what we're doing, how we're doing it and compensation is an important piece and we look at that as well. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. So, just wanted to touch on two things. First, is there -- as you think about the -- when I think about the call -- you talked about the -- this kind of sequencing, it's usually a multi quarter episode, I mean I'm thinking about like the way you slice it down [indiscernible] a few years ago. Can you just be clear, have you seen any actual churn in your order patents? Or is it just affects of sequential stabilization? Michael Roman : Lawrence, I mean you broke up a bit, so I'm not sure I got a question. But I think you're asking about the softening and the slowdowns that we're seeing. They can sometimes last longer. Do we see any indication that those are turning or not expected last long, is that the kind of\u2026 Laurence Alexander : Right. Did you see \u2013 have you seen any actual turns in order patterns? Or is it really just more -- everybody's forecasting the back half therefore? Michael Roman : Well, I would say we haven't seen a sharp turn in softening markets. We're in line as we go into April with our expectations. I would say maybe we see that the inventory adjustments slowing down. I mean, those don\u2019t tend to be fourth quarter unless there's another macro event that drives it. Those will adopt pretty quickly. That -- and we're seeing maybe some signs of that as we go forward. But we certainly don't see what these particular markets automotive electronics. They're forecasting, a stronger second half and we don't see the early indication of that yet. I think it makes sense to a degree what they're talking about, but not early days of April have we seen that. Laurence Alexander : And then just secondly on the litigation side. How much have you -- have you done a full scrub of the exposures? I mean, when you have a scientific -- culture scientific debate sometimes the debates look different after the fact. So have you gone through and just scrubbed the way the debates were handled within the firms so that there's no surprises as the litigation proceeds? Michael Roman : Lawrence, I would say this is a top priority, an issue for us as an enterprise and we are taking it with that in mind. And we have -- we formed a corporate affairs organization as part of our business realignment. Really it brought together a lot of the people that are working on this among other issues because there's broader brand and reputation strategy that they are focused on. But we have -- we've invested in I think a bigger capability around how do we look at it, how do we manage it, and how do we -- how we really take our brand reputation and take that forward as a company. So the answer is we are stepping up to it. It is emerging issue that has certainly gotten bigger as we went through the last year. And I would say we're stepping into it with every capability and with a lot of good counsel as well. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Michael Roman : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So when I look at the annual bridge on EPS, I think you guys this year were planning on about $0.30 to $0.40 from transformation productivity and pension tailwind. Are you -- are those still isolated items? Are those still on track? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Steve, the pension impact, the underlying business transformation productivity, the footprint action savings, those are all on track. But with the lower growth, the two things changing lower growth and all other productivity, those are the two components that are bringing that that part down, as well as the charge that we're anticipating in Q2 for the restructuring actions. Steve Tusa : Okay. Yes. And that entire charge is coming in Q2. You're going to take that or run that through EPS? Nicholas Gangestad : We think the majority of that \u2013 it could be all of it, but we think the majority that will be in there. Steve Tusa : Okay. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what you kind of expect now for margins? Whether it's second quarter, the year, I mean, the more detail the better it is, so we call all kind of calibrate and reset ourselves from this level, operating margins. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. Steve, when we take into account our recent acquisition of M Modal, when we take into account this restructuring charge, we are seeing margins down likely 100 basis points for the year, with those two items contributing just over half of that total decline in the margins. And that's different, where, from a three months ago, saying we were expecting margins to be up. The core underlying productivity, even with these actions we don't think it's going to be accretive to our margins yet this year. We think that will come later. Steve Tusa : Right. And one last quick one. So you mentioned Minnesota on the PFAS stuff. I thought you guys already took a charge for Minnesota. Was that \u2013 are you saying, we already took that charge, so we're just reminding you of it? Or was there an incremental charge in Minnesota? Michael Roman : Yes. Steve, it was -- I would say, a bit of a reminder. But it was \u2013 just to let you know, this encompasses those facilities. There is \u2013 there was a small part of it that just \u2013 is part of Minnesota as we look ahead. But it was \u2013 the 850 was the majority \u2013 the vast majority of what we faced in Minnesota. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes. That charge -- the 850 is the last year, Steve. Michael Roman : Yes. Steve Tusa : Yes. No, no. I was just \u2013 I'm trying to, kind of, like, I just \u2013 I don't know whether the \u2013 I thought the 850 kind of ring-fenced it, for a lack of a better term. So the fact that there's kind of another charge in Minnesota, I'm just trying to kind of \u2013 I definitely haven't done \u2013 I'm not a lawyer, I don't know how to work on this. So I thought kind of the 850 took care of Minnesota. Michael Roman : Yes. And that's the way to think about it, Steve. We\u2026 Steve Tusa : Okay. Michael Roman : This was just to make it complete, so that we didn't leave Minnesota out and then have it kind of question by exception. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for detail. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael Roman : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes. Hi. I just want to pick up on Steve's point there. What was the trigger point to make this NRD charge probable and net submitable? I know there was a ruling in New Jersey. Was that the sole trigger point? Or was there something else that we're missing? Michael Roman : With the NRD I think really what you're talking about Nigel is a year ago. I think what you're really asking is, what's the triggering point for us to be taking this charge now in the first quarter. And we've been working on that with a number of the parties, where we have litigation going on. And we reached a point where we felt that based on the progression of those, the facts on those cases and where we stood with potential settlements, we actually did have some settlements occur in first quarter, which gave us better visibility in how to estimate more broadly across all our manufacturing sites, what we see is our liability. Nigel Coe : Okay. Michael Roman : And by the way\u2026 Nicholas Gangestad : The New Jersey is not one of the places where we manufacture. That's a different lawsuit related to the use of the product and not related to our five manufacturing sites Nigel. Nigel Coe : Okay that's great. And then just one quick one on kind of two key setup. You talked about maybe 100 basis points of channel, you've got the selling day headwind moves away 1Q to 2Q, but then we've got a type of comp about two or three points. Would you expect to have [ph] that 2Q would remain sort of in this low single-digit decline range? Nicholas Gangestad : Nigel, it would not surprise me if we were looking at negative organic growth in the second quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Michael Roman : Hi John. John Walsh : I guess maybe just to follow-up on Nigel's question about that point of inventory. Does your guidance assume that that comes back i.e., there is some refill at some point in the year? Or is that contemplated as just these inventories are now going to remain where they are for the balance of 2019? Michael Roman : Yes, John it's really is the latter. So it's more a model of that remains. For inventory to come back there we would have to be a noticeable upturn in the market and that with some of the outlook for the second half that could be possible, but that's not what we're looking at. We're looking at the adjustment down levels out and we manage at that level as we go through the year. John Walsh : Got you. And then I guess can you give us an update on, there was a lot of focus at the Analyst Day on this $1 billion sales bucket of priority growth platforms. Can you give us an update of what they did in the quarter? Michael Roman : John, we'll update you maybe in more detail as we go forward. We saw very good progress across those priority growth platforms. There are two things that we measure. One is the revenue and the second is, are we making progress in the milestones so the product launches and the specifications. And you take automotive electrification and we saw significant wins in Q1 and new spec in business and we continue to see strong upper single double-digit growth even in that portfolio. And I would say across the businesses this has been one of the bright spots. When you look at quarter like this, there is a lot of challenges and it's disappointing, but there are some businesses and some bright spots and we had good business performance in our existing portfolios and we've certainly would count our priority growth platform as one of the positive contributors to growth and new products more broadly. But those priority growth platforms are even stronger. So we \u2013 I'm pleased with where we are. We're tracking to our plans and we can update individual programs when we talk to you. John Walsh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Michael Roman : Okay. Thank you. To wrap-up, we are moving with urgency and taking action to strengthen our performance in 2019, while investing for the future. I remain, confident in the world-class capabilities of our enterprise and in our 3M model. We know we have to rebuild our credibility. I'm confident we will get our performance back in line with the expectations of our investors. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you to please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please note we are reporting our results under our new business group structures starting with the second quarter. Additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation along with our May 30th, 8-K and our Investor Relations website. Lastly, let me remind you and mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call which will take place on Thursday, October 24th. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in particular, measures which exclude the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am encouraged by our company\u2019s progress and performance in the second quarter, coming off a difficult to start to the year. While we continued to face slow growth conditions in key end markets, our execution was strong. We implemented our restructuring while effectively managing costs and reducing inventory levels, which I will discuss on the next slide. Our team is building momentum going into the second half as we focused on what we control and as a result today we are affirming our guidance for the full year. At the same time, we remain focused on our four priorities for long-term value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation and people and culture. In the second quarter, this included our acquisition of Acelity, an excellent complement to our health care portfolio and which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Please turn to Slide 4. As you recall on our last earnings call, we laid out specific and aggressive actions to strengthen our performance. In the second quarter, we made significant progress with each of those actions. First, the restructuring has been finalized across the enterprise, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $148 million. We continue to expect annual savings of $225 million to $250 million with $110 million in the remainder of this year. Beyond the restructuring, we are driving increased cash flow through several other actions. For example, we adjusted our manufacturing output and reduced inventory levels by over $250 million in the quarter. We also curtailed indirect costs by more than $80 million year-over-year. While we are making positive strides in our operations, there is still more to do and we will remain focused on managing costs and improving productivity. As we do this, we will continue to invest in organic growth, the research and development and CapEx to deliver on our promise to innovate for our customers. Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our second quarter. Organic growth companywide was minus 1% in line with our expectations. Growth was led by our Health Care business at 4% which was a good improvement versus Q1 and consumer grew 1%. We saw continued end market softness in China, automotive and electronics, which tempered growth in our other two businesses. Growth in Safety and Industrial declined by 5%, while Transportation and Electronics was down 1%. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, which includes a $0.21 charge for restructuring and a $0.07 benefit from a pending divestiture, which Nick will cover in his remarks. Underlying margins were 22.2% which excludes 140 basis points of impact from the restructuring. So we are making good progress relative to our Q1 margins, up 21.4%. Importantly, we delivered this improved margin performance even while reducing production and inventory, which reflects the strength of the 3M value model. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank our people for rising to the occasion and for executing our plans with focus and urgency. And while there is more work left to do, 3M\u2019s foundation remains strong. We have deep competitive advantages [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands. We have market leading businesses and strong relationships with our customers. Moving ahead, we are focused on investing for the future and continuing to deliver operational improvements which will enable us to better serve our customers and maximize value for all of our stakeholders. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter organic sales declined 0.9% in line with our expectations. Volumes were down 140 basis points while selling prices were up 50 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 10 basis points. While foreign currency translation was a 180 basis point headwind to sales. All in, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2.6% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. was flat organically versus last year\u2019s 6% comparison. Last year\u2019s second quarter was boosted by increased customer demand ahead of our U.S. ERP go-live. Health Care grew mid single digits with Consumer up low single digits. Transportation and Electronics was flat while Safety and Industrial declined. Asia Pacific declined 90 basis points in Q2 with Health Care delivering positive mid single digit organic growth [indiscernible] while each organic growth in China was down 80 basis points with growth in Health Care and Transportation and Electronics, which was more than offset by declines in Safety and Industrial and Consumer. For the year, we now expect organic growth in China to be down low to mid single digits versus a prior expectation of flat. As we continue to experience challenging end market conditions, particularly in the electronics and automotive industries. EMEA declined 3.6% on a nearly 6% comparison in last year\u2019s second quarter. Latin America/Canada grew 70 basis points with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico each up low single digits. Please turn to Slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Companywide, second quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $1.7 billion. Operating margins were 20.8% which included a 140 basis point impact from our second quarter restructuring and other actions. As anticipated, the biggest impact to Q2 operating margins was the year on year decline in organic volume along with cost absorption penalties from lower production volumes as all business groups work to reduce inventories in the quarter. These factors resulted in a 200 basis point reduction to margins versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 50 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of M Modal. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to second quarter margins. For the year, we continue to expect selling prices to more than offset raw material costs. And finally foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 40 basis points. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $2.20 per share. That was a bit better than we anticipated, primarily due to improved productivity along with the held for sales status related to a pending divestiture, which I will cover shortly. Let me now cover the reconciling items to second quarter earnings. Negative organic growth along with absorption penalties from lower production and inventory levels reduced per share earnings by $0.19 [indiscernible] divestitures combined increased second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share versus last year. This result includes a $0.07 tax benefit related to the held per sales status of the pending divestitures of the gas and flame detection business that we announced in June. Restructuring and other actions lowered Q2 earnings per share by $0.21. Our second quarter underlying tax rate was higher year on year, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% versus Q2 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion with a free cash flow conversion rate of 110% which includes a 14 percentage point benefit from the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Second quarter capital expenditures were $421 million, up $56 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we paid $830 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $400 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. We continued to expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which declined 5% in the quarter. Similar to first quarter, we saw continued broad based softness and channel inventory reductions across most of the portfolio. These factors particularly impacted our automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking systems businesses. Personal safety was up low single digits in Q2 against the double digit comparison a year ago. And roofing granules turn positive this quarter, growing low single digits organically. Looking geographically, Safety and Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 1% increase in Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. each declined. Safety and Industrial\u2019s second quarter operating margins were 22.1% with an underlying decline of approximately 200 basis points. Margins were impacted by negative organic growth, reductions in manufacturing output and inventory along with our second quarter restructuring actions. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Second quarter sales were down 120 basis points organically compared to last year. The electronics-related businesses were down low single digits organically with growth in display materials systems more than offset by declines in electronics materials solutions. Our automotive OEM business was down 5% year on year impacted by a 7% decline in second quarter global car and last year strong comp. Transportation safety was up mid single digits and advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth up high single digits in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was flat in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Transportation and Electronics second quarter operating margins were 24.1%, down 240 basis points. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by manufacturing and inventory reductions along with a 30 basis point impact from restructuring. Turning to Health Care, as anticipated, this business improved versus first quarter as our team delivered 3.5% organic growth in Q2. Organic growth was broad across most of our Health Care business, led by a high single digit increase in health information systems. Medical solutions, our largest business in Health Care was up mid single digits and we continue to look forward to Acelity becoming part of this business later this year, up low single digits. Finally, drug delivery was down mid single digits in line with our expectations. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific and the U.S. led the way each up mid single digits. Health Care second quarter operating margins were 26.4% which included a combined 210 basis point impact from the M Modal acquisition and restructuring. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was nearly 1%. Sales grew low single digits in Consumer Health Care, stationery and office and home improvement. While home care declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, while Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Consumers operating margins were 20.6% in the second quarter which included a 40 basis point impact from restructuring. That wraps up our review of second quarter results. Please turn to slide 11 and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike to discuss 2019 guidance. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Nick. Today, we are affirming our guidance for the full year. We expect organic growth of minus one to plus 2% along with adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Please note that this guidance does not include the pending Acelity acquisition or the pending divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We also continue to expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22%. And a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. While there is uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our guidance, as we will see continued momentum from the actions we implemented in the first half.  [Indiscernible] PFAS, specifically, PFOA and PFOS, which are the subject of a litigation we face. As CEO, there are few things that I want people to know about this issue and our company. First, 3M voluntarily phased out of the production of PFOA and PFOS in the early 2000s and was the first company to do so. Since then, we have been committed to using our expertise and resources to improve the knowledge of PFAS, support remediation and give people confidence in their water. 3M has invested $100 million in testing water sources. We have invested another $50 million for filtration systems as these substances can be effectively removed, which 3M has been doing for more than a decade. We have entered into voluntary agreements with states and communities where we manufactured these compounds. We have also contributed to peer-reviewed journals, backed by hundreds of studies conducted by 3M and other researchers on the potential effects of PFAS. At the same time, we are continuing to work with the EPA along with state and local governments to support thoughtful regulations and solutions based on science and facts. We also believe that an independent scientific body should partner with regulators to review all available [indiscernible] continues to evolve. The scientific evidence does not show that PFAS caused harm to people at past or current exposure levels. More broadly speaking, being an environmentally responsible company is core to 3M. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago and we continue to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges. Earlier this year, we committed to move our entire global operations to renewable energy. And last year alone, 3M solutions helped our customers avoid 15 million tons of emissions. Sustainability is a value that matters deeply to our people, to our customers, and to me personally. It is a point of pride for 3M and we will defend with vigor our company\u2019s reputation in the court of law and in the court of public opinion. That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Nick, can you talk about the cadence of the quarter as it went on? Some industrial companies have talked about a bit of a stabilization late in Q2, did you see that at all in Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and last quarter you said these stockings from your customers cost you something like a 100 basis points of revenue growth was similar impact in Q2 as it does look like your auto OEM business performed a bit better than the underlying market. So have you seen any signs of industrial or auto destocking this closer to ending? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Andy. Throughout the quarter, the trends were pretty stable as we saw our sales progress through each of the three months. I can\u2019t say we really discerned any positive or negative trend as the quarter progressed. If I shift it internally, we did see our momentum in terms of reducing in regards to channel inventory I said about last quarter about 100 basis points of what we impacted channel destocking. We were again seeing channel destocking impacting us in the second quarter in particular in the SIBG business, safety and industrial business group. We think that was a very similar destocking impact to what we saw in the first quarter and as far as automotive, we were in most noticeably impacted by destocking in China and that just was not the same event in the second quarter. It was a pretty much more normal relation of auto builds to our penetration and less channel destocking going on in relation to auto. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. Nick, that\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned in the presentation that you\u2019ll save $110 million in the second half of the year $0.15. It will help to have a decent step-up in EPS in the second half even outside the benefit to make the midpoint of your guide. So how much of the step-up is in your control? Can you give us some more color on how much of your business transformation and stocking optimization initiatives can help you in the second half? I think there'll be programs in terms of savings that are continuing to ramp in second half and in 2020. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Andy, a few things are going on. First of all, we have been progressively taking more and more inventory out of our own operations. We think some of that that\u2019s going continue into the second half of the year. So that will continue to be a headwind that we are facing in the second half of the year. We will be getting the restructuring benefits of $0.15 that we talked about as well as I\u2019ll just say overall disciplined cost management in light of what we would call a slowing economy right now. So some of that our own discipline in execution will be impacting us in the second half. On the margin, there are some other things that will impact us. FX, which has been a neutral to a headwind in the second \u2013 in the first half of the year, that will be likely if FX rates stay where they are, that they will be coming positive to us in the second half of the year. But mainly it\u2019s just going to be improved execution over what we saw in particularly in the first quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks Nick. Nick Gangestad : Thanks Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey Nick. Maybe just kind of staying on the \u2013 how to think about the margins for the rest of the year, obviously, like a big headwind this quarter was the manufacturing and inventory reductions. And you guys have given some estimates for what you expect, productivity to be like this year and clearly, you are also moving ahead with indirect cost reduction. So I don't know, is the right way to think about it as you progress through the year that these things are going to offset each other? Or should we be thinking about them as a tailwind? I'm just trying to understand how to think this through. Nick Gangestad : Joe, if I think about where we are going to end for the full year, let me just start out by saying when I look at collectively where all the sell-side analysts are in their view of the total year. My view is it looks like you collectively have it dialed in about right. What I\u2019m seeing collectively amongst all of you means it lines up very closely with our own internal view of how things will progress for the full year. If I look at in particular in Q3, Joe, right now we are expecting organic growth in the second quarter to be somewhere between flat to a low single digit organic growth. And as far as margins, what we\u2019ve been seeing happen throughout the year and what we expect to continue to happen as we progress into Q3, Q1 to Q2, absent the restructuring actions, was a sequential improvement in margins as we focus on execution. We think that sequential improvement going into Q3 is going to continue. So we expect our margins to be 23% or higher in the third quarter. And so what we are seeing there is some momentum building on our margin story. And so I'd say, Joe, those are the headlines to think about and how you are thinking about the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s super helpful, Nick. And I guess maybe, Mike, very, very helpful, commentary earlier on PFAS. I guess just as \u2013 obviously, it's hard to assess how this all shakes out, but I\u2019d be curious to get your views on like timing on when we could think about when we\u2019ll start to get some sort of resolution, as it continues obviously to be a bit of an overhang on the shares? Mike Roman : Yes. Joe, I wouldn't think about timing. In respect to timing, let me kind of talk about what we can say today. And it's not a lot, but it\u2019ll give you a couple of things to look at. The first trial, if there is a trial, related to the Wolverine cases in Michigan that would be at the end of first quarter. These are kind of fuzzy time lines. They're not fixed. But that's kind of the expectation when the first trials related that if there is a trial would come to us. AFFF, the MDL, the multi-district litigation, we wouldn't expect any actions on that until late 2020. So those are kind of a frame of the litigation and timing. And as we learn more \u2013 as I said in my comments, we're gaining and understanding all the time. And as we learn more, we\u2019ll update you as we go. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of Merrill Lynch, please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Can you hear me? Mike Roman : Yes good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Could you just walk us through core gross margins ex restructuring sequentially versus the first quarter and how should we think about progression on that side of the equation through the year? Thank you. That\u2019s the first question. Nick Gangestad : Okay, Andrew. A little bit of this will be a repeat from what I said to Joe, but our core underlying margins\u2026 Andrew Obin : Gross margin, yes. Nick Gangestad : Gross margin. Thank you for clarifying that Andrew. So our gross margins in the first quarter if we pull out the costs related to some litigation activity that we had in the first quarter, our core underlying gross margin was 48%. In the second quarter that went down. If I pull out the restructuring down to 47.5%, and that's being impacted, we think we estimate by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the second quarter by the aggressive actions we're taking and pulling out inventory in our production. So underlying operations, we're seeing good execution on what we're working there. And we expect those gross margins to continue to be impacted by us taking actions on our inventory. But we also do see our gross margins improving slightly into the third quarter. Andrew Obin : So if we pull that out, just to clarify, if we pull that out, you're sort of recovering slowly from that 48% into sort of more historical range of 49%, 50%. That's a fair statement if you take out inventory, Mike Roman : Andrew that's a fair statement. Andrew Obin : And then on inventory, I assume that improved free cash flow forecast for the, I think, it's Slide 23 upon Slide 24, that's all working capital, right? Mike Roman : Yes, we\u2019re keeping our projection of free cash flow conversion. Well I think you're actually going into a deeper slide. Improved working capital is the biggest thing impacting our free cash flow conversion and dollars for 2019. Andrew Obin : And if you were to quantify how much incremental working capital reduction opportunities do you have for the next 12 to 18 months? Mike Roman : I'll isolate it just to inventory, right now, Andrew, in answering that question, 250 that we took out in the second quarter, we think there's another $100 million or $200 million that we can be taken out of the second half of 2019. And then as far as 2020, it's a little early to say, but we've been targeting to get down to 85 days of inventory outstanding. That's where we're targeting to get to the end of this year. If we're going to bring that down further in 2020, I\u2019ll likely be giving that guidance later in this year or early next year. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Hey Julian. Mike Roman : Hey Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just focusing on Q3, so I think you talked about flat to slight organic sales growth firm wide. Maybe just help with a couple of aspects of that. One would be, does that assume further channel destocking and how severe would that be in Q3? Not your own under production efforts, but that channel destock. And then what are you assuming for the Transport and Electronics business within that, after what was a pretty good Q2? Mike Roman : It's probably good to step back. I recognize we've been seeing, the global economies slowing as we came through second quarter, but this is a trend that we've been seeing since late last year. And I would say if you look at now third quarter as we move sequentially forward to deliver on what Nick was just talking about, it really is a stabilization of the markets that we\u2019re facing and the trends that we\u2019re seeing. And to go below that it would have to \u2013 the economies would have to degrade even further. And if you look at channel Nick talked about what we saw in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, we think when you look at the total year as it plays out a majority of the inventory adjustments in the channel are taking place in the first half. So it will be a lesser impact even though there\u2019ll be some impact in the second half. So that plus a easier comp as you get into Q3 if you look at it with our ERP deployment last year that would all add up to that trend. And just on your question about TBG we would see them down in the second half from where they are in \u2013 sequentially from where they are in second quarter. But in line with the market outlook that we\u2019ve talking we don\u2019t \u2013 I think early in the year people had been talking about, been hoping for a stronger recovery in automotive and electronics. But we see a more conservative view of that now with build rates down and continuing to be soft as we go into second half may be stabilizing a bit versus where they are in the second quarter, but still down. So we see sequentially down in TBG. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Nick Gangestad : Hey Julian just to add a little bit what Mike said there for Transportation and Electronics in the third quarter particularly, we expect that to be down low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. And that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019re expecting as far as guidance for the full year for Transportation and Electronics. We\u2019ve guided that we think for the full year that somewhere between flat to down 3%. And if I had to estimate right now, I'd say we're much \u2013 we\u2019re leaning more towards the low end of that range for Transportation and Electronics for the full year. Julian Mitchell : That's extremely helpful. Just following-up on that Nick, as you said, that's trending towards the lower end. Also I think from a regional standpoint you took down your China assumption for the year. So maybe help us understand in the context of the overall reaffirmed organic sales growth guide for 3M for 2019 which of the regions or segments that are coming in maybe at the higher end or looking a little bit brighter today than back in April? Nick Gangestad : Yes, so healthcare as far as the guidance that we've given for the full year on that, that's when we see more likely in the high end of the range; and Transportation and Electronics more likely towards the low end; Consumer. I'd put right in the middle of the range that we've laid out. And the SIBG we see it in the range, but that also could be in this bottom half of the range. And as we guided a negative one to plus two for the full year, last quarter and as we're affirming it, there was also a sense that we had there may be some places where things come in a little weaker and we're seeing that happen and that gives us the ability to continue to maintain that guidance, going forward. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Nigel. Mike Roman : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hi. Just want to keep kind of follow-on that one really. Just kind of think about what the all means to that minus one plus two. So, it seems like you sort of biased in towards slightly below the midpoint based on what you see today, would that be fair, Nick, sort of looking at maybe flat to up slightly for the full year? Nick Gangestad : Yes Nigel, I mean the midpoint of that range is up 50 basis points, so flat to up 50 to a 100 basis points, like that's I think of very fair zone for where our most likely landing spot is. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's helpful. I'm not sure I missed some of the prepared remarks. Did you quantify the impacts of inventory headwind this quarter? So that down 90 bips, what was the sell through that you saw, excluding inventory headwinds? Nick Gangestad : Now there's, Nigel, there's two different inventory points we talked about on channel inventory contractions that last quarter in the first quarter we said it was about a 100 basis point impact to revenue. We think second quarter was something similar to that. And Mike also clarified that we think well we still have some ahead of us for channel contraction, we think the majority is behind us. In terms of within our company as we have been reducing inventories ourselves, reducing our production, we've said that \u2013 I've said that we think that impacted our margin in the second quarter by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's very clear. Thanks for the detail. And my follow-on question is really on the location and implications of some of the one time of this quarter. There was $0.07 tax gain, did that land in the tax line or was that somewhere else Nick? And then secondly, the restructuring is 1.12 operating, 3.6 non-operating. The payback was based on $0.20 of restructuring. Is that the right way to think about it or does the payback sort of come down because some of it is non-operating and maybe just touch on the nature of that non-operating restructuring charge. Nick Gangestad : Okay, Nigel I\u2019ll just parse out the two pieces you're asking about, the $0.07 benefit we incurred in relation to the held for sale status for our Gas Detection business, that ran through the tax line, the income tax line of our income statement. The $148 million impacting our operating expense and the balance $36 million of non-op. And that's exactly in line with what we were expecting. We were estimating approximately $150 million. The fact that some of it is hitting non-op versus operating doesn't impact at all the projected benefits we have going forward of approximately $110 million yet this year and on an annualized basis, $225 million to $250 million. As far as where that restructuring happened, I would say geographically it happened around fairly well dispersed around 3M. And as far as business of the $112 million that was in operating expenses of that restructuring, about 75% of that was in our corporate and unallocated section, and about 25% of that was in our businesses. Now the benefit, that $110 million of benefit, that will be felt by our businesses through the second half of the year and it will be fairly proportionate to the size of each of our businesses as far as the benefits that you\u2019ll see in the second half. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks Nick. Operator : Alright, next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Nick Gangestad : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Nick, just a point of clarification on the inventory de-stock that you saw externally by your customers. You said that 100 basis points in the first quarter kind of look similar in the second quarter. But auto, I think, China auto specifically got better. So within that something must have gotten worse. Where did we see that get worse? Nick Gangestad : As far as anything that got sequentially worse versus the first quarter Josh, nothing comes out particularly strong. I think in aggregate in China we continue to see China destocking on a more broad basis. So we didn't see it in our automotive business of any significance. What we saw across our Safety and Industrial business that view Josh was very similar in terms of the total destocking impact that we were seeing of a 100 basis points both quarters. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I know it's a little early to think about 2020 but I guess thinking back with historical context for how destocking and re-stocking cycles go, should we expect to just be selling to kind of market demand as we get to the end of this? Or presumably in China there's kind of a bit of rational exuberance on both sides of the equation that as soon as things turn destock turns into restock. Has that historically been the case or should we just think about 2020 starting point as, hey, maybe we will lose some of that destocking headwinds? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Josh, maybe a couple things. If you look at the channel and I would say the value chains, customer value chains, they react to the dynamics in the end markets pretty quickly. What you saw in the destocking the first half, they were reacting quickly to the build rates and automotive electronics. We expect that to stabilize in the second half. We'll see some additional destocking because of some of the slowing that we saw in second quarter, but it'll stabilize. So really to start to think about what happens in 2020 or even late in the year, it will depend on the end market dynamics. If they recover and their demand goes up, then you would see a pretty strong turnaround in restocking. But if it stabilizes and the projections and outlooks economically are more stable in the second half, then it would be balanced as we get into the second half. And then it depends on what happens in demand as we go into 2020. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on business transformation and the savings associated with that. Obviously there's a lot of moving pieces in the organization right now with restructuring, and some of the demand dynamics and the internal destocking. How are you benchmarking on some of the business transformation savings and kind of non-savings related kind of other benefits that would happen throughout the organization? Is that's something where those kind of go by the wayside or harder to execute on? Just an update on how that track. Mike Roman : Yes we've always talked about transformation as a focus that starts and ends with a customer. But it is really making us more agile, more efficient and more competitive and that that creates value, all of those create value. And it also helped us realign the company around the four businesses, the go-to-market models of customers that we have. So it's enabling us to connect our customers even better as we move ahead. And it's a lot more than an ERP deployment. It's the entire ecosystem around that and it's digitizing our enterprise. All of that's adding efficiency. And so we are committed to the savings that we talked about at the beginning, it\u2019s the value realization that we would have by the end of 2020. But it does help us drive productivity. It does help us become more efficient broadly. And we talked about how that starts to show up in our margins over time. It's an enabler for us to continue to create premium margins as we move ahead. So it is going to be a driver of the savings that we've talked about, but also of that efficiency that will carry us forward. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right. Thanks guys. Nick Gangestad : Yes thanks Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Steve. Nick Gangestad : Good morning. Steve Tusa : The $0.07 of the tax benefit, I mean my tax line was relatively in line. Was there then a kind of a higher than expected effective tax rate and does that sustain itself? And also is that a $0.07 benefits kind of now in a run rate per kind of quarter here, or is that just kind of a onetime discreet item? Nick Gangestad : Steve first of all, it's a \u2013 let me just describe it in a little bit of detail. The gas detection business that we own is in a position where we plan to sell it and the tax basis that we're holding that asset at is greater than the plan selling price. But it's also the book value of what we hold with that asset is below the plant's selling price. So when we sell it, we will take an operating income capital gain on that. But from a tax perspective it will be a loss. Now I'm a bit over my skis here describing accounting nuances to you, but the accounting rules are, once you place this asset in a held for sales status if it's in a tax loss position, you take the tax benefit immediately even before the deal actually concentrates. So that $0.07 is a result of us putting it in that status. So that's not an ongoing repeating thing that will be seen. As far as the underlying operations, no see there's not any big one thing offsetting that. There's always little nips back and forth in the tax rate. And the underlying tax rate for the full year we still think is going to be in the range of 20% to 22%. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then gain when it comes to the divestiture, you said, that still $0.20 and that's still to come and not in the guidance. Nick Gangestad : It's still not in the guidance. Steve Tusa : Pre mature? Nick Gangestad : Yes, that's still not in the guidance. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one, just on the second half are you planning for kind of there's a lot of things moving around, but are you planning, is this in your mind kind of normal seasonality for you guys for the second half of the year? Nick Gangestad : Normal seasonality if I look at\u2026 Steve Tusa : Normal. Nick Gangestad : But the only thing that's abnormal is last year was a bit abnormal for us with some of our pull ahead sales into second quarter. So from a sequential basis we're not seeing this year progressing on an abnormal path. I think it'll be fairly normal. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just one last quick one, this $0.07 it's in the tax line, correct in the models that $0.07? Nick Gangestad : That is correct, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike Roman : Hey Deane. Nick Gangestad : Hey Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, the three problem areas that have been pressuring 3M for like more than past year auto electronics in China. So the China you called out has continued to be soft but notionally on a geographic basis is quarter it did not stand out as a particular negative. So can you comment on that and what kind of color you see across your businesses in China, in particular related to kind of the tariff and trade frictions? Mike Roman : Yes, Dean, we do talk a lot about China auto electronics and kind of get them all together, but maybe just if you step back and look at China for 3M we continue to see strength in our healthcare business up high single digits. And so that was driving a strong growth for us. We also saw strength in our Medical Solutions business in particular. Transportation and Electronics was up low single digits in the quarter. We saw significant decline in Automotive OEM, but that was, countered offset by electronics up low single digits. We saw strong growth in our Transportation Safety business there and our Advanced Materials business. So there was some strength areas that helped trying to balance out. As I said earlier, sequentially we see Transportation and Electronics a little softer in the second half. And so we're taking a conservative view around build rates in electronics outlook as we built our view of the second half. And that's part of impacting China. But second quarter, some strengths and a good performance against a strong comp year-over-year. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And then on electronics, everyone wants to paint electronics all with the same brush, both product lines and geographies. But you made the comment earlier that display film was actually up and relatively strong and it was electronics material solutions that were softer. Maybe just share with us the nuances about why you would see those different dynamics within the supply chain. Maybe there's some semiconductor exposure there as well, but color would be helpful there. Mike Roman : Yes I think that your last point is the place to start. Our electronic materials solutions business has a broader exposure in electronics, including semiconductor, fabrication, data centers, which continues to be a helpful market and growing. But it's got a little different exposure. Display materials, certainly has the consumer electronics piece. The biggest part of the revenue there is consumer electronics, but we're also moving into higher growth areas like automotive electrification and we continue to see growth there. We continue to see some good results. And I would say consumer electronics, we saw a little bit of an uptick in displayed demand in second quarter, little stronger than maybe we even expected as we started into the quarter. Some of that is you start to see a little bit of buying in anticipation of the second half season for consumer electronics. And so we saw a little bit of that starting in second quarter. And that that hits display materials more so in a much bigger impact than in electronic materials. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And just last one is more of a comment than a question is I really appreciate the comments about PFAS, and where that stands and the level of transparency that 3M is providing here. I'm just struck by how much misinformation is on the Internet regarding the chemical. Referenced it to being a forever chemical. And the reality is there are a number of very effective ways to remediate the chemical from water. They're all proven to be effective. The question of how much you want to spend, how big is the water body and your timeframe. So the remediation on this looks like it's doable and you all are taking an appreciated approach to this. So just wanted to have that. Mike Roman : Yes thank you Deane. And we understand the concerns people have about their water. We take the issue seriously, but we're also seeing that we can make a difference in remediation and we'll continue to be transparent and update you as we go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thanks everyone. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning John. Nick Gangestad : Good morning John. John Inch : Nick just to clarify. So the $0.20 when you say it's not in the guide, just to be clear, the $9.25, $9.75 would not include the $0.20 of pending gain from the sale of gas and flame. Is that correct? Mike Roman : John that's correct. It does not include the pending gain from the sale of our gas detection business, nor does it include any impact that will come from Acelity when and if that in and when and if that closes which we expect will be later this year. John Inch : Right. And then Nick in the P&L the other expense income line of minus $256 million versus $51 million a year ago, I'm assuming Venezuela charge of $162 million is in that. And is the delta, the $36 million of nonop restructuring kind of getting you to $58 million? And does that number run through \u2013 doesn't look like it\u2019s running for the adjusted number, but maybe you can help me with just the bridge there. Nick Gangestad : Yes, that other, that will include the Venezuela, will also include $36 million from the restructuring actions we took that were not part of operating expense, those were the two biggest things in there. John Inch : There's nothing else in there as consequences. And $36 million does run through, as a cost, runs through the adjusted number, is that correct? Nick Gangestad : That is correct. That is correct. John Inch : Okay. Are there any, just while we're on gas and flame, are there any other businesses, I guess this was part of safety, right? Was there any other businesses Mike or Nick that you're looking at that may be potential candidates for divestiture? Mike Roman : John, portfolio management is one of our top priorities and as you know it's been ongoing process for us. And we're actively managing this aspect of the portfolio and their fit with our value model. We've shown that when we don't have the right fit, we'll take action. But that's something ongoing process we'll keep you updated. John Inch : I guess my question is, would \u2013 did this just come about? Or were you've been working on it for a little while, or what was the genesis of it? Mike Roman : This particular case, the gas detection business, when we made the acquisition of Scott Safety, this was part of our strategy at the time of acquisition. So this was we've talked about on portfolio how we think about complementing our organic priorities with acquisitions that leverage our fundamental strengths. Scott Safety was one of those, moves us into a high value space. And gas detection we identified that early that wasn't part of our strategy and now we're acting on it. John Inch : Got It. And then just a couple more cleanups. I think you said \u2013 maybe Nick can you just update us on your expectation for share repurchase in the second half? And then I think you raised the dividend by 6% in the first quarter. Maybe Mike, philosophically you've got a lot of \u2013 you got a few pressures on your cash call at the moment. Are you committed still to an annual dividend increase kind of looking out? Nick Gangestad : Yes John, let me take that. First, as far as the dividend our position for many several years has been that we expected to grow, our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. Now this particular year is with the 6% increase that's outstripping our earnings growth, but the concept of us continuing to increased earnings our dividends year-over-year, I'd say that's a philosophy and approach we continue to expect. But I would say as far as expecting a dividend increase that over time it will parallel fairly closely our earnings per share growth. And then John remind me of the first part of the question. John Inch : Sorry share repurchases. Mike Roman : Share repurchase, yes. Nick Gangestad : I've guided $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year. That would imply at most just a few hundred million in the second half of the year. John Inch : And, I'm sorry for this last point. Obviously the earnings are going down, is the philosophy you grow dividends with earnings, but if your earnings are going down, are you just going to hold the dividend, or and then wait for the catch up? Is that kind of the implication? I'm not actually trying to hold you to a number I'm just trying to understand the philosophy. Nick Gangestad : No, the philosophy would be over time. I would think unlikely that we would decrease full flat or decrease a dividend even if there was one year of an earnings decline. If I go back to other times in our history where we've had an earnings decline, we still have some small increases in our dividend. John Inch : Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning John. Nick Gangestad : Good morning John. John Walsh : So in the prepared remarks you kind of talked about higher pricing being able to offset inflation for the full year. Just want to pull apart that price piece and just we've seen a deceleration right for the full year on an absolute basis. Nick Gangestad : Yes, I'll go even further John. So we've averaged about 70 basis points of price growth in the first half of the year. My best estimate for the full year is we'll be right in that range. So I wouldn't characterize it as a deceleration. I think about 70 basis points first half. I think something in the range of 70 basis points that can have is our best view on that now. And remain quite confident that it will more than outpace what we're seeing from a raw material and tariff inflation impact. John Walsh : Got you. And then just thinking about the third quarter organic growth the flat to up low single digits that still implies that the growth on growth would decelerate because you have an easier comp in Q3 of 2018, just maybe some color that you saw exiting the quarter, June, July, anything you can kind of talk to as the trajectory seeing currently. Nick Gangestad : John's the biggest trajectory change that I'll say that that colors the flat to up low-single digits in the third quarter as far as versus a comp is my earlier statement that we expect Transportation and Electronics to be down low to mid-single digit. I think that will be the thing that colors why sequentially versus an easier comp it's not quite the same level of growth you would expect. When I look across the rest of our businesses your analysis you just went through, I think, is a pretty valid analysis. John Walsh : Great, appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes thanks John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I have two quick ones. Can you just give a little bit more detail on what trends you're seeing in aerospace, it seemed a bit weaker than what we've heard from other companies. And secondly, on PFAS or PFOS and PFOA, that litigation area, can you characterize whether the U.S. standards are tougher or easier than in Europe? And maybe just sort of help us get in front, get ahead of where the food contactor base is because I think that that's like another cloud of noise that shouldn't really be affecting you. But I think sort of people are, sort of focused on the European side there? Mike Roman : Yes, Lawrence maybe starting with aerospace when we talked about the business we talked about Automotive and Aerospace together as one business and when you look at the divisions that we share and that we report the revenue from its together. Our aerospace business actually has shown some good growth as we come through the first half of the year. So it's smaller than our automotive business, but it's an important business for us in doing well. So I don't think we're saying anything different, in that respect.  What I would say about, thinking about Europe versus U.S. and PFAS or PFOA, PFOS regulations, the regulations are really evolving right now. I don't think it's clear to \u2013 I don't think I can clearly compare U.S. versus other international Europe regulations it\u2019s very evolving and we're working with regulators broadly both federal and local. Laurence Alexander : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning fellows. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Jeff. Mike Roman : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey obviously a lot of ground covered. I thought it might be interesting to just flip the script a little bit to things that look okay or a little bit better. So in particular your confidence level and consumer maybe being kind of middle of the guy, healthcare may be better. Just a couple finer points on what you see going on there what would drive that? Where are we at in kind of the drug delivery, comps, et cetera? Mike Roman : Yes, so I would say if you look at healthcare, we talked about at a good quarter. And behind that is a strong market growth. So this was a \u2013 we\u2019re not a place where we got good market dynamics and our businesses are performing well. We had our biggest business, our Medical Solutions business, up mid single digits, we saw strength in the U.S. we saw strength in China as I talk about it. Our food safety business was up mid-single digits, our Health Information Systems business was up high single digits. So it's pretty broad-based performance as we went through the quarter. We did see a decline in drug delivery as we expected in mid-sing digits in Q2. We\u2019re talking about how we see that stabilizing as we go through 2019 and we do see some improvements sequentially as we go into the second half in that business. So that will actually help the overall performance of the Health Care business. So second half we also have the same comparables year-over-year dynamic. We have a little easier comparable in the second half. So strong market dynamics, a portfolio performing well, broadly and I think, a strong of performance against comps in the second half. You look at Consumer we're at 1% and as Nick's comments said, kind of the middle of the range as we look for the total year. If we look, we got good balance between our sell in and sell out. And all of our businesses in the second quarter were growing with exception of our home care business. And we see that sell out dynamic setting up a good middle of the range kind of performance in the second half against some growth in retail spending in the macro. Jeff Sprague : Is there anything that conclude or any comp issue as it relates to that home care business? What was actually going on there? Mike Roman : I think we saw maybe a little bit of a comp year-over-year we had some of the same go-live of the U.S. ERP deployment impacting that business. And I would say consumer is larger in the U.S. than some of our other businesses. About half of our global revenue is in the U.S. So it's a bigger footprint. So it has a slightly higher impact when you have that pull ahead, and it did impact all of those businesses in 2018. Jeff Sprague : Alright, thank you guys. Nick Gangestad : Yes thanks Jeff. Mike Roman : Thanks Jeff. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments Mike Roman : To wrap up, I am encouraged by our Company's progress in the second quarter. Our execution was strong in the face of continued slow growth conditions and key end markets. As we effectively managed costs and improved our cash flow. Moving ahead and we remain focused on continuing to drive operational improvements, investing for the future and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. Our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 28th, 2020. Please note we will be providing our 2020 guidance during our January call. As a result, we will not be having a 2020 outlook meeting later this year. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4 and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team executed well and delivered a strong operational performance in the third quarter, building on our progress in the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we continue to effectively manage costs, improve productivity, and invest for the future. We exceeded the cost savings plan that we laid out in April, at the same time reducing inventory by $180 million. This is on top of the $250 million reduction in Q2. Our underlying margins were strong, and we generated robust free cash flow with a conversion rate of 106%. At the same time, we are making good progress on our four strategic priorities for value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture. For example, two weeks ago, we finalized our acquisition of Acelity, which is an exciting addition to 3M's health care portfolio. In Q3, we also divested our gas and flame detection business and announced the sale of our ballistic protection business, all part of our ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio. Later in today's call, I will also discuss our guidance for the full-year and provide an update on PFAS. Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our third quarter results. Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive and electronics, which represent 30% of our company. Growth in the rest of our business was positive. And we saw strength in end-markets such as residential construction, medical and consumer retail, which Nick will discuss. We also continue to see good returns from our investments in innovation, including the priority growth platforms we have shared with you in the past. Year-to-date, these platforms are up 9% as we create differentiated solutions for customers in areas such as auto electrification, connected safety, and structural adhesives. Turning to EPS, we delivered GAAP earnings of $2.72 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.14 benefit from the Q3 divestiture that I talked about earlier. We generated underlying margins of 23.8% with all business groups above 23%. For the second consecutive quarter, we improved our margins on a sequential basis while reducing inventory, which shows that our productivity actions are working. We also saw notable improvements in both EMEA and Canada, two areas where we have deployed our new business processes end-to-end. In these areas, we are seeing improved margins, better use of data analytics, lower inventories and enhanced customer service, which gives us continued confidence in our ability to realize the benefits from our transformation journey. In summary, I'm pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter. I thank them for their efforts and continued focus as we move forward. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back with some additional comments after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter, Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance. Third quarter organic sales declined 1.3%. Volumes were down 160 basis points, while selling prices were up 30 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 60 basis points. Well, foreign currency translation was a 130 basis point headwind to sales. All-in third quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. declined 1% organically. Consumer and health care each delivered solid growth in the quarter. This was more than offset by declines in safety and industrial and transportation and electronics. These two businesses were impacted by weakness in end markets and channel inventory adjustments which further softened as we moved through the quarter. Asia-Pacific declined 4% in Q3, Japan's organic growth was up 3% with broad base strength across most of our businesses. Organic growth was down 9% in China driven by continued weakness in automotive, electronics and export related markets. For the year, we expect organic growth in China to be down mid single digits. EMEA grew 2% with positive growth across all businesses. Latin America, Canada grew 3% led by strong growth in Canada and Mexico. Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $8 billion, with operating income of $2 billion. Operating margins were 25.2% which included a 140 basis point benefit from the Q3 divestiture. Overall, I'm pleased that our actions to drive productivity continue to gain traction with strong underlying third quarter margins of nearly 24%. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see the breakdown of our third quarter margin performance. First, the biggest impact to Q3 margins was the year-on-year decline in organic volume, along with our actions to lower production volumes and reduced inventories to improve cash flow in the quarter. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from the restructuring actions taken in Q2, as well as net gains related to property sales. In total, these factors resulted in a 160 basis point reduction to margins, versus last year's third quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 100 basis points to margins, primarily due to the gain from this quarter\u2019s divestiture, which was partially offset by the M Modal acquisition. Higher selling prices continue to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 30 basis points to third quarter margins. Well, selling prices came in a bit lower than expected, our sourcing efforts to reduced raw material costs resulting in a net benefit, which we expect to continue as we move forward. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 80 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.72 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit from this quarter\u2019s divestiture. Excluding this benefit, overall earnings were solid as the 3M team delivered strong operational performance. Looking at the components of our year-on-your earnings performance, the net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and the other items that I covered on the prior slide, reduced third quarter per share earnings by $0.16. Acquisitions and divestitures combined increased third quarter earnings by $0.10 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share tailwind in the quarter. Our third quarter underlying tax rate contributed $0.08 to per share earnings year-on-year. The lower rate is primarily a function of last year's tax reform and the benefits it created for U.S. based companies with a significant portion of their manufacturing in the U.S. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2.6% versus Q3 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered very strong cash flow in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion with a conversion rate of 106% which included a negative 27 percentage point combined impact from the Q3 divestiture, and cash payouts of previously accrued respiratory related legal settlements. For the full-year, as a result of increasing cash flow, we are raising our expectations for conversion to a range of 105% to 110% versus 95% to 105% previously. Third quarter capital expenditures were $349 million and remain on track to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for the year. During the quarter, we paid $828 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $142 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 10, where I'll summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which declined 3.3% organically in the quarter. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw continued end market softness and channel inventory reductions, which impacted most of our portfolio. Looking geographically, safety and industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 2% increase in EMEA and a 1% increase in Latin America, Canada. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined. Safety and industrials third quarter operating margins were 26.8%, which included a 3.9 percentage point benefit from the gas and flames detection divestiture. Overall underlying margins in this business were solid in the quarter when considering negative organic growth and inventory reductions. Moving to transportation and electronics. Third quarter sales were down 3.4% organically compared to last year. The electronics related businesses declined high single digits organically, as demand remains soft in consumer electronics, semiconductor and factory automation end-markets. Our automotive OEM business was down 3% in line with third quarter global car and light truck builds. Advanced Materials grew mid single digits organically well both transportation safety and commercial solutions each grew low single digits. Geographically, Latin America, Canada grew 7%, EMEA was up 1% organically. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined mid-single digits. Transportation and Electronics third quarter operating margins were 25.2% down 250 basis points. Similar to safety and industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales and inventory reductions. Turning to health care, the business delivered 2% organic growth in Q3. Organic growth was broad based across most of our health care business. Growth was led by a high single digit increase in Health Information Systems. We continue to invest in this business, including this year's acquisition of M Modal, which recently launched a new AI clinical documentation software that provides real time insights to clinicians. Medical Solutions, our largest business in health care was up low single digits in the quarter. We are excited to have Acelity join this team, which Mike will cover shortly. Food safety grew organically mid-single digits with oral care up slightly. Separation and purification was down mid-single digits, primarily due to softness in China. Looking geographically, health care grew across each area. Health care's third quarter operating margins were 26.7% impacted by 1.5 percentage points from the M Modal acquisition. Also impacting margins were inventory reductions, Acelity acquisition related costs and investments in priority growth platforms. Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our consumer business was nearly 3%. Sales were led by  mid-single digit growth in home improvement and low single digit growth in consumer health care. Well stationery and office and homecare declined. We saw continued strength in many of our leading brands in particular Filtrete, Command and Nexcare. Looking at Consumer geographically, EMEA, Latin America, Canada and the U.S. each grew low single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined. Consumers operating margins were 23.2% in the third quarter up slightly year-over-year. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. And I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Nick. I would like to make a few comments about our acquisition of Acelity, which was finalized earlier this month. We are excited as we bring together two innovative companies focused on improving health care outcomes for patients. Acelity offers an impressive range of medical solutions, including their groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy. They are an ideal fit within our health care portfolio, complementing our existing business and further accelerating 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, which is a significant and growing market. Acelity has annual revenues of $1.5 billion and year-to-date, they have delivered organic growth of 5% and EBITDA growth of more than 10%. We look forward to leveraging the fundamental strengths of 3M, especially our global reach and technologies to build upon these results and drive even greater value. We expect the acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive to GAAP EPS in the first 12 months or $0.35 accretive excluding purchase accounting and anticipated one-time expenses related to the transaction. We are pleased to welcome the talented people of Acelity to our 3M team and are confident in the value this acquisition will deliver to our customers and our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 12 where I will discuss our guidance. Today we are updating our guidance to incorporate the Acelity acquisition along with our expectation of continued softness in China, automotive and electronics. With one quarter remaining in the year, we are providing our guidance for Q4. We anticipate earnings in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 and an organic sales decline of 1% to 3%. On this slide, you will also see our updated full-year guidance for EPS and organic growth. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to make a few comments related to PFAS. We continue to proactively manage this issue. And I would like to provide some specific updates of what we have done since our last earnings call. As you may know in early September, we testified before Congressional Subcommittee in Washington D.C. We reminded the committee that the weight of scientific evidence does not show that PFAS cause adverse human health effects at current or historical levels. Opposition shared by public health agencies and independent science review panels. In our testimony we also announced a number of commitments that build upon our existing efforts related to PFAS including supporting new coordinated research into PFAS, establishing a clearinghouse to share best practices on detection, measurement and remediation, supporting nationwide science based regulation and continuing to work with former customers to help ensure that unused AFFF containing PFOS is properly handled. We also reaffirmed our commitment to ongoing remediation of our manufacturing facilities and historical disposal sites. With respect to litigation, the AFFF multi-district litigation is still in the early phases and at this time no trials have been scheduled. Outside of AFFF, the earliest we expect other product related trials to begin would be in the Spring of 2020. Moving forward, we will continue to keep you updated as developments unfold. In summary, as I look across our company, I see the strength of the 3M model. We have deep competitive advantages in our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands. We also have experienced teams that know how to manage through macroeconomic slowdowns, which our businesses tend to see early. In these situations, we put an even greater emphasis on improving our operational performance and reducing costs, enabling us to generate strong cash flow as we did again in the third quarter. And throughout the business cycle, we remain focused on winning with our customers and keeping them at the core of everything we do, a great strength of the heart of the 3M culture. As a result, we are well positioned to lead out of this slowdown, and deliver strong growth and premium returns as our markets recover. Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Nick, can you give us more color into your revenue guidance for Q4, if you look at sales comps. They're reasonably close to Q3 and Q4, you are forecasting continued deceleration at the mid-point of your guide, so you are expecting some of your markets just still get worse in Q4 and could you give us some color by segments are the biggest changes there in safety and industrial, and then in health care, are you going to reach the high end of your range. And how much of that is the China slowing that you mentioned? Mike Roman : Andy I would say when you look at Q3 versus Q4, Q4 has a very similar dynamic to Q3. You start with industrial production GDP, they're pretty much in line quarter-to-quarter. We, as I said in my remarks are still anticipating some that slowing in China automotive and electronics could continue through Q4. So that outlook continues to remain the same. I would say our view of Q4 is on the top line, much like Q3 and with a range around it. And then we are and our focus continues as you expect to focus on execution. There are growth opportunities, that 70% that has positive growth in Q3, there are growth opportunities there, so we're going to be pursuing those aggressively and there are much of health care as part of that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Mike and maybe shifting gears, Nick, can you give us more color and how you're thinking about all the moving pieces around margin obviously good performance in the quarter, you got to around 23% in Q3 and you came in closer to 24% ex-divestiture. So you talked about second half restructuring, currency tailwind lessening impact from inventory destock. And then you've got the transformation optimization ramping up. So can you talk about which of these variables were better than expected? And if it's possible, could you give us some early color and how you're thinking about these variables into 2020? Nick Gangestad : Okay, Andy, quite a bit you asked there. First of all, we are I am very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. When we strip out the gain on our divestiture nearly 24%, and we're seeing productivity actions that we\u2019re taking gaining traction. And at the same time, we're continuing to lower our production volumes and inventories with our focus on improving cash flow. So very pleased with that. Now when we look at what's going on in the margin performance itself in the quarter, there's about 150 basis points that we lay out that's negatively impacted from organic growth, inventory reductions and other items and about a third of that headwind is just directly related to the lower organic growth. And then the remaining two-thirds is tied in with our lower production on lowering our inventory levels. And it is partially being offset and being benefited by our restructuring actions, which are coming in exactly as we expected. And we also had a gain on a sale of some property that will just go into a little more depth on. We continue to do have a portfolio process where we're reviewing our assets that we have in place looking for are they optimal? And can we be moving to more cost effective operations, we continually do that. And then in the third quarter, we consummated a transaction disposing of an office building that resulted in a net benefit of about 50 basis points to our margin, or about between $0.06 and $0.07 per share. So those are the main things going on in the quarter from a margin perspective. If I as far as next year, Andy, I think it's really too early. We're so focused on delivering 2019. We'll give guidance on that in January. Andrew Kaplowitz : All right, thanks Nick. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, John. John Walsh : I guess, maybe going back to electronics and automotive markets, maybe even China as well, in the Q, you have the reported numbers, you kind of give us some direction on the local currency growth on the call, but are you actually seeing the second derivative start to improve in those end-markets. So if you look at some of the external data, electronic markets declines have kind of stabilized, at least where they are in terms of negatives and gotten a little bit better sequentially, auto could potentially flip next year as second derivative gets better, but can you talk specifically to your businesses and those that touch those markets, what you saw in the quarter? Mike Roman : Sure John. Yes, just maybe kind of look across all those starting with automotive, so automotive the build rates are still negative and actually, I would say, the projections, they were worse than the projections maybe bit better than what we saw in the first half but still negative and so that was something that is an update to how we look at the second half of the year, I think we had a more conservative view of the overall projections. And so we are planning for this. We did see additional channel reactions to those negative build rates. We had talked about in the Q2 call that we thought a majority of the channel response to the decline in automotive and electronic more broadly took place in the first half of the year, but we did see some additional adjustments, a big part of that in I would say in China, but more broadly than that as well.  Electronics continued to be a drag in terms of end markets, they were negative growth as well. There's some signs out there that people are optimistic it\u2019s going to improve. We have some early indications that semiconductors is looking like it might start to improve. Certainly there's been some good consumer electronics, OEMs and brands that have talked about increasing sales. We've yet to see that necessarily play through the supply chain for us, but it's, I think the Q3, Q4, what I said earlier to Andy's comment, we see auto electronics and China kind of in line between Q3 and Q4. So we haven't seen that what we call a bottom and an upturn yet, although there are some signs in electronic side anyway, that there's an outlook for improvement coming. John Walsh : Okay, thank you for that. And then I guess as we think about at least the acquisitions and I know, you don't want to get into next year, but maybe we can talk about the underlying you're seeing in the back half this year, obviously M Modal will flip from being a headwind to a tailwind based on your prior guidance for that business. We have Acelity coming in, but can you talk about the underlying health care business either in terms of incremental, if you were to take out all the noise, are you seeing anything different than history? Or maybe just help us understand what's going on there in an underlying basis? Nick Gangestad : Hey, John, just to clarify you\u2019re talking about growth or margin when you're saying that? John Walsh : Sorry, on the margin side, on the margin side, because there's going to be a lot of noise in that margin number, particularly on Q4 through the acquisition dilution. Nick Gangestad : Yes, thanks for clarifying that, John. So what we're seeing in health care, from year-on-year margin performance, the biggest thing as I said earlier is coming from our M Modal acquisition and yes, that will start to flip next year. Other things going on there, we're continuing to invest in a number of priority growth platforms. If those are a number of growth platforms that you've seen us lay out and health care has a disproportionate amount of those and we continue to invest in that. We also in the current quarter is some investments we're making as we get ready for the Acelity, as we were getting ready for the Acelity acquisition, that that's, that's part of that. Just from a historical standpoint, we reorganized this business earlier this year, and added our separation purification business to be part of this. And I think, John, we restated and shared with those were on a restated basis for last year and the year before that, the health care business was operating on about a 28% operating income margin. John Walsh : Great, thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Please proceed. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Hey, good morning. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, maybe just starting with the health care division, not so much on the margin side, which I think you've clarified that maybe organic growth. So I think the organic growth year-to-date in health care is running at about 2%. Also, just wondered, when you're looking at that, maybe over the next 12 months, what are you expecting to accelerate that number and related to it separation purification rolled over, it sounded like having been flattish in Q2. How long do you expect that downturn to last and maybe tied to health care? The Acelity GAAP dilution has shrunk a bit versus what you said at the time of the deal. What drove that? Mike Roman : So, Julian, I would start with just this remains a very attractive business, the end markets are very attractive with some strong growth trends, the demographics play well here. So, as we look forward, we see that as a strong growth driver for us. If you look in the quarter that the 2% growth, it was positive across nearly all of health care and it was led by good growth again in Health Information Systems and food safety, strong growers. Medical solution was up low single digits. The headwind that we faced with separation and purification, as you talked about, and that was primarily due to elevated channel inventories in a few areas of the world. And one of those is China, where we have a significant separation purification business, so that was the headwind, we did have both drug delivery and oral care. We're up slightly in the quarter and we expect drug delivery to continue to improve sequentially as we go forward and oral care continues to grow strongly, globally we saw some softness in the U.S. And we think the strength globally will carry us to better growth as we move ahead. So the overall markets have strong portfolio and the medical solutions business getting stronger with the integration of Acelity. By the way, the results in health information are reflecting some of the early synergies that we're getting from our M Modal acquisition bringing those teams together that's really starting to play out in the market for us as well with our customers. So I think we do see it improving as we go into next year. Nick Gangestad : And Julian in regards to the improved guidance that we're giving in regards to Acelity, we had previously said that in the first 12 months, we expected it to be $0.35 dilutive to GAAP earnings and we now expect it to be $0.25 dilutive in the first 12 months to GAAP earnings. That\u2019s $0.10 better EPS impact is primarily related to lower than expected financing costs. We saw interest rates from the time we announced that to when we actually obtained that financing improve. That's one piece and the most significant piece, we also are seeing better than expected EBITDA projections for that business than we were assuming back in May when we announced this deal. Julian Mitchell : That's good to hear. Thank you, Nick. Maybe one quick follow-up switching tack, just looking at the firm wide P&L for Q3. Very good performance on SG&A to sales coming in at 18%. Just wondered how much you thought that was sort of variable costs, or something temporary, like currency affecting that number or that ratio and how much is related to fixed cost reduction efforts that Mike you've been putting in place the last 12 months, and whether that sort of lower SG&A to sales run rate may be sustainable. Nick Gangestad : If I look at this year-on-year, third quarter last year to third quarter this year, we're down about 80 basis points year-on-year. That's the combination of a couple of things. First of all, FX is not having a very material impact on that on as a percent of revenue, because it's, it affects both the numerator and the denominator, not a big change there. The two biggest things, Julian that are impacting that. One is the restructuring actions that we took in second quarter, we're seeing that benefit, the second and that that I see as sustained. The other thing that's impacting that is the gain we had on the sale of the building that I mentioned earlier, that that will not be a repeated action. It's about half and half. Mike Roman : And Julian I would just as Nick said, we're executing well against our plan for the restructuring actions. Our teams are also responding to the dynamics that we see in the market and I think you see good operational and cost discipline as part of every business. So those are both playing through. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : And just a question, sort of another broad question on growth, as we think auto probably will remain a headwind, specifically North America and even if China bottoms into 2020. Just wondering, what kind of set of macro assumptions do we need for 3M to grow top line organically in 2020? Overall, I'm not asking for your forecast. But if you could just outline what's the baseline macro scenario that gets 3M growing in 2020? Thank you. Mike Roman : Andrew I\u2019m probably not ready to get the forecast. But I would say what you talk through just automotive electronics and you think about broader across what we've been talking about in our businesses, absent a recession and or some other major downturn in the markets in 2020, we expect to have positive growth across the company. You'll see know, at least in a year-over-year comparable improvements, less headwinds in automotive and electronics. As I talked about earlier, we're seeing some early signs that we might have some upside in electronics going forward, though, that has to play out. Right, we are focused on Q4 and Q4 will tell us a lot about what to expect certainly in early 2020. But absent a recession, we expect to have positive growth. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up on electronics, historically, you guys have been very good at calling out electronics a lot better than other suppliers into the industry. Seems it was one area of the shortfall in the quarter. Can you give us more specifics as to what sub segments within electronics end market. And I'm, looking at one of the slides where you give the full blown disclosure, what specific end markets or products drove deceleration of this quarter versus previous quarter? Thank you. Mike Roman : Maybe I will talk about\u2026 Andrew Obin : In 18, I\u2019m referring to Slide 18. Mike Roman : Yes, I will talk about the four end markets in electronics broadly that are -- that we talked about when we talked about driving our growth, consumer electronics, we saw softness in that, continue to come through in Q3. Factory automation, there's no sign that that's turning around at this point, and that that also remains soft. Auto electrification, we saw lower build rates in Q3 in electric, in automotive electrification related platforms and make some models and so that was impacted by the overall auto build rate. And so that was that we still had some growth in our auto electrification portfolio, but not as strong as we had seen earlier in the year. And then semiconductor, I would say it declined into the quarter but as I said, there may be some early signs that we\u2019ll see that pick up as we go forward. So, that's kind of the view of the four. So literally three of them were soft in the quarter and our frame is to, that's the outlook for Q4 as well. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Steve. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So given you aren't going to do the kind of a year-end meeting, will there be a point where you guys kind of it just seems to me like a lot has changed since we last kind of sat down and walk through the strategy like a little less than a year ago. Will there be a time here in the next six months or so and certainly in the context of like maybe what you might learn on the PFAS front, where we'll kind of all get together and reset kind of the long-term view or are you still of the view that, steady as she goes, there's really no change to kind of the longer-term framework and algorithm you provided, last fall or winter, whatever that was in Minnesota? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve certainly the first year of our five year plan hasn't turned out as we anticipated, and given the slowdown in those key end markets, we've been talking about. We do have parts of our five year plan that are just as a reminder are doing well. We're on strong are on track for strong performance in free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, but you're talking about growth when we look at growth in the outlook. Our Q4 earnings calls where we'll give an outlook for next year which is really the next indicator of where we are to get back on track with the longer five year plan. It's I think we are taking the right actions, I think it's early to today to give an update on the five year plan, but we'll be looking for the right time to do that as we come out of our guide for next year. Steve Tusa : Okay, so there's no like you're still kind of a, hey we'll see what happens here. And we may or may not reset that. I mean, is there a chance that you'd look at that? Or is there basically no chance that this is basically just a cyclical element in your first year and you will assume everything kind of bounced back? Mike Roman : We\u2019re always looking at the long-term plan versus what we see in the markets, and I think as we get a better view of 2020 we will incorporate that and then we'll come back to. Steve Tusa : Okay, and then just one last thing on the -- on kind of the leverage the core underlying leverage. I mean, I appreciate you guys had you know some pretty significant inventory headwinds. It still seems to me, especially with the property sale, that there's a bigger decremental kind of volume impact even when you strip out the impact of inventories, is there anything that kind of changes that over the next couple of years? Are you guys spending more than you would otherwise be spending in kind of a tougher environment? I mean, how do we think about the type of growth you guys need to have, that kind of 40% incremental margin or some real leverage on the margin as things come back up because it looks to me like the decremental leverage remains a little bit tough when you strip out everything but volumes? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Steve when part of our year-on-year comparison is as you noted, aggressively pulling out inventory out of our own supply chain, we're estimating year-on-year that's having a 150 to 200 basis point negative impact on our margins. So to partly answer your question reaching a point of more stability on our amount of inventory in production that we have in our supply chain. That in itself is in the future going to start to create some of a tailwind to us when we\u2019ve depleted that inventory out. And by the way, we in our guidance here, we're estimating that we're going to take about another $50 million of inventory out of our supply chain in the fourth quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay, and then one last quick one on price cost? Is that that material benefit, that\u2019s kind of like, detached from volume, right? So like volume goes down, obviously your materials are going to go down, or is that how does that kind of reflect that dynamic? Just remind me about, just remind us of that? Nick Gangestad : Yes, that's detached from volume. That's looking at what we're getting from prices versus what we're paying for our raw materials. And we really don't factor in a volume component to that. Steve Tusa : Yes, okay. Great, thanks for all the details. You guys were very helpful. Nick Gangestad : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, John. John Inch : I just want to pick up on the point of the year-end meeting, is this just a suspension for this year based on economy or an influx, or this permanently you're not going to hold these anymore? And so I'm actually curious, how do we get our gift bag of stocking stuffers? Mike Roman : Well, John, it\u2019s definitely we think it's the right thing to do this year. So we have a really clear  view of what we saw in the quarter as we start the year. We think we can give a better outlook at the earnings call. We did it last year, too. And the dynamic was similar. We saw changes in the end markets coming and we thought it was a better place to give, I think just better quality outlook for the year. So we're going to do it again this year. John Inch : Yes, I don't disagree. Honestly, November last year was a little early. Just based on the way things were fluctuating, that is not really that much of a surprise. I do want to ask you though, the U.S. did seem to step down in the quarter kind of versus that trajectory and not sure that we're hearing that really from other companies. So I'm curious, kind of what's your read Mike and Nick, on the U.S., what kind of got worse? Was there some inventory? Is this transitory or, what's kind of going on in the underlying and Asia also seem to get a little worse too, but I think you sort of explained that with the additional inventory step down that kind of occurred in some of those end markets, but what's going on in the U.S.? Mike Roman : Sure, John. IPI as I said earlier, IPI is kind of similar Q3 to Q4 worldwide, but the U.S. we saw significant decline in IPI and a revision down into third quarter and Q4 actually is projected to go negative. So you're seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing, we're certainly seeing that and that's impacting our safety and industrial business, our auto businesses is certainly caught up in that. We have good growth areas in much of health care. There's some segments, consumer and retail spending continues to be strong in the U.S. And there's some other segments like construction where we've seen significant growth opportunities, but that broader industrial manufacturing set of markets is weighing on the U.S. results. And then we saw with that slowdown, we saw additional channel actions in the quarter. And so that was part of what you saw coming through our numbers, especially our safety and industrial business. John Inch : And I'm assuming I mean, obviously, we all saw the September I assume print, I'm assuming everything you've seen thus far in October doesn't is the trend since September kind of more or less the same with respect to the United States or is there any other, is there any difference thus far realize that you still got another week to go but? Mike Roman : Well, I would say as we've talked in the past channel tends to react pretty quickly. So we it's early days in October, we'll see if there's additional reaction there, but I think I would say what I said earlier that Q4 and Q3 kind of in line and October starting out as expected. John Inch : And then just lastly, Nick on the $0.35 of Acelity accretion, how much like how should we spread that there's obviously going to be some in the fourth quarter through the next four quarters. How would you spread that? And then what about the restructuring savings that we took in the second quarter from those actions? How much hit the third quarter? And how would you expect, again, sequentially the restructuring savings from your second quarter actions to play out? Nick Gangestad : So the restructuring savings, just as a reminder, we expected an annualized benefit of $225 million to $250 million where we expect $110 million of that to be impact the second half of this year, and that's playing out as we expected and it's almost evenly split between Q3 and Q4. And then the balance of that we expect to benefit the first half of 2020. That that's in regards to the restructuring. As far as Acelity and now you're on to, you're not talking about the GAAP impact, but now from a $0.35 once we exclude the purchase accounting and the transaction and the integration costs, we expect that a large chunk of that's going to be hitting in Q4 right now, all we\u2019ve guided, we expect about $0.15 on a GAAP basis, but on a non-GAAP basis, we're not providing guidance yet. But of that $0.35, we will be seeing that more evenly spread over the next four quarters. John Inch : Maybe the point is the fourth quarter what how much of the fourth quarter been as Acelity, is that $0.15 of your fourth quarter guidance? Nick Gangestad : Yes, from a GAAP perspective, it's a $0.15 headwind to us in the fourth quarter and then another $0.10 headwind in the first three quarters of 2020. Mike Roman : Yes, John that is included in our guidance. John Inch : Yes, okay. All right, we will work details offline. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Mike Roman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hey, good morning, Deane. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I\u2019d like to circle back. I know inventory has come up multiple times during this call. But maybe you can just clarify the interplay here, you're referring to customer channel inventory adjustments, and we've seen this multiple quarters now you called it out with safety and industrial, just because of lower demand, it gets reflected in your organic revenue growth. So we get that but then, as 3M, you're also taking inventory down. You did $180 million this quarter, you said there's another $50 million. The interplay between the two, how what inventory you actually taking down is all worth the result of lower customer demand? And then Nick, help us understand the cash flow impact as you liquidate this inventory? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Deane this is impacting our cash flow positively. And it's the single biggest driver, while you're seeing us increase our estimate of cash flow generation for the full-year, as we're realizing these benefits of reducing inventory within our own walls. Some of that is in response to what we're doing, responding to what we see a lower, lower demand right now. So that's, that's part of it Deane, but part of it is also that we're seeing opportunities for us to be managing our own supply chain more effectively. And that was part of what we've talked about for the last few years around business transformation. I would say we are starting to see some of that benefit. And that's part of the reason why we have this confidence that we can be bringing down our inventories and improving the cash flow as you're seeing. Mike Roman : Deane, I would add that and we had a plan coming into the year to take down inventory significantly. And follow on to our go live in the U.S. last year, August. We have built inventory ahead of that. We talked a lot last year about what customers did Q2 to Q3, but we built inventory to manage through that. We didn't take all of that out by the end of 2018 and had a plan to do that in 2019. And so what you're seeing part of significant part of what we're doing is that plan and executing it while we see a slowdown and are having to manage our operations against that slowdown. Deane Dray : That clarification was very helpful. And just as a follow-up, I know there was some SG&A questions but it also looked like corporate costs came in lower. Was that all, was real estate gains there and then interest also looked lower and what were the dynamics there? Nick Gangestad : The real estate gain that was all in corporate Deane, you're correct on that. As far as interest expense, the total net interest expense came in slightly lower and this will be the last what I'll say low quarter for a while be and this is part of the $0.15 guide. We're saying on Acelity because late in the quarter we issued more debt and we'll be seeing our interest expense increase in the fourth quarter. So we ran, I would say pretty steady interest expense over the last three quarters, we will be seeing that uptick in going into Q4. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Scott. Mike Roman : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Is there any color you can give us an how the rating agencies view the PFAS overhang, do they circle a number around it and that's called one turn of debt or something like that and just, or is it just not? We're just not far along enough along on that yet? Nick Gangestad : Scott, I described it as I'd say both our rating agencies as well as everything else -- everyone else on the equity side as well is interested in what that that will be, it's something they're watching, and monitoring just as we're monitoring, I'm sure same as your monitoring as well, but there's not a specific thing that I know of that they're building in their estimates for that for our rating. Scott Davis : Okay, and I have and cycle timing is always tough, but you're taking down inventories now and then, presumably, sometime in 2020 things get better. I mean, is there a top line impact? Do you think missed orders or risk at all in the inventory plan? Or is it just or inventory so high that it's just, it's just not an issue? Mike Roman : Yes, Scott, I would say, really what I was talking about this, this big part of our inventory actions this year are follow-on to our go-live in the U.S. and that we don't see that impacting our service. That's getting us back to where we should be. And I would say we what I highlighted in EMEA and Canada as we get deployed end-to-end, we actually see additional benefits and we can get more efficient and manage cycle times differently and days of inventory outstanding will go down and service will go up. And so we're seeing that kind of virtuous combination. So I don't nothing we're doing is putting at risk service. And I would say it's a indication that we're moving forward and getting a position to have better service at lower inventories. Scott Davis : Are the customers holding less inventory to your mind? Mike Roman : Well, when you go through distribution across a number of our models, they're all getting more efficient, they're driving out structure and cycle time as well. So I think some of what you see in inventory reductions in the channel is just them driving more efficient models. Big part of it this year is the slowdown in the end markets. But in general, I think you're seeing all supply chains get more efficient, at least the ones related to us. We are seeing them get more efficient inside our four walls and then with our channel partners as well. Scott Davis : Okay, super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So maybe my first question, just touching on the decremental margins. I think, Nick in your prepared comments, you highlighted the good decremental in safety and industrial. And I'm just trying to figure out the divergence between the decrementals in that business versus the decrementals in the transportation and electronics business. And so any insight that you can provide on either how much of that is either mixed or end-market specific as to as opposed to how those businesses are being run, and how to think about those decremental margins moving forward? Nick Gangestad : As far as the decrementals between SIBG versus TEBG that I think there's a lot of things in common, Joe actually more than what they're different where they're both seeing volume reductions impacting them as well as taking inventory. And as well as taking inventory out. On the TEBG side, there is also some mixed benefit that's impacting the TEBG numbers a bit more than the SIBG numbers, partly from the geographies in which TEBG sells as well as the businesses where we're seeing the growth versus negative growth this quarter. Joe Ritchie : So is it is it fair to assume that as things, things stay negative for the next couple of quarters? The decrementals then in the transportation and electronics business should remain kind of at pretty high levels. Whereas, you'll be you'll be able to manage safety and industrial a little bit better? Nick Gangestad : Yes, over time Joe, as I'm sure you've observed this to TEBG will have higher incrementals and higher decrementals partly given the fixed asset base that we have there that when things are going up, we tend to see a lot more of that fall to the bottom line and when things are going down, we'll see more of that, that flow. So it'll tend, it will follow what's happening with our volumes in the coming quarters Joe. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And then Mike, maybe one question for you, as you kind of think about things on a higher level, not too long ago, you guys performed a strategic review of the Health Information Systems business. I'm just wondering, given what we're seeing in the markets today, is there another thought to kind of look across the portfolio closer to see, if there's any opportunity from a divestiture standpoint? Mike Roman : Joe, we are always evaluating our portfolio. It's an ongoing process. It's one of the things as we built to become a more active Portfolio Manager, it's really become an active ongoing process and we're focused in that, as I've shared in the past that we're focused on optimizing the value of our portfolio, on an ongoing basis and looking at everything from what we do with our organic investments to where we focus our acquisitions, and what we do with to optimize all parts of our portfolio, including divestitures. And we showed examples, again, where we were, when we identified parts of our portfolio that we could create greater value by divesting them, we're ready to take those actions. So I think it's, I think of it as a very active portfolio pipeline on an ongoing basis and something we top priority for us. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Mike Roman : Hey Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hey, Nick, could we just go back to the inventory impacts. I think you said 150 and 200 basis points. So was that $150 million, $200 million, please clarify that? Nick Gangestad : That was 150 to 200 basis points impact based on our year-on-year change in inventory levels and throughput that we're putting to our factories. Nigel Coe : Yes, okay, can we just dig into that because that implies a $500 million gross margin impacts, just based on the 150 on revenues. And theoretically, that comes back in 2020, as you think about inventories, but it seems like apples for apples, you\u2019re cutting inventory by about $400 million excluding disposals. So I'm just wondering how on earth, it can be as big as that impact just because of the fixed costs absorption. So maybe just kind of clarify that point please. Nick Gangestad : So Nigel, part of that analysis is looking at how much we built inventories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to how much we reduced inventories in the third quarter of 2019. And in the third quarter of 2018, we were still building inventories fairly substantially. And that's now slipped. So all of that 150 to 200 will not pull forward into 2020 because some of it is a statement on the benefits we were getting in 2018. Nigel Coe : Got it. Okay, that helps. We'll take it offline on that one as well. And then you kind of alluded to this in the answer to I think Joe's question on the geographic mix location of the sales and you're growing in EMEA, which is your lowest margin regions still, you\u2019re declining heavily in Asia, which is your highest margin, so maybe just address the mix impacts that you\u2019re seeing right now on margins? Nick Gangestad : Yes, so some of our businesses and that as we look geographically, Asia-Pacific is one of our higher margin places. And EMEA is one of our lower margin places, so geographic mix is having an impact on us. On the EMEA side, you're accurate in saying, it is our lower margin parts of the world. However, I will point out and thanks for bringing that up. We've been on a journey of rate increasing our margins there. And we are very pleased with the progress we've been making in 2019 on our progression to moving our West European margins up to 20%. 2019 has been a substantial step towards reaching that by 2020. And we were highly confident will be there by next year. Nigel Coe : Got it. And then just one quick one, Nick, on the FX hedge the eight basis points of impact this quarter. How does that evolve going into 2020? Do we flip into a slight negative in 2020 means any views on that? Nick Gangestad : It depends on whether you're asking about margin or EPS. We continue to have a number of unrealized gains that if currencies stay where they are. We'll see those gains flowing through in the next two years from our hedging. Right now, I'm not willing to say whether I think it's going to be a benefit or not because there's just too much volatility in the FX market to say but if you look at our 10-Q that we\u2019ll be issuing, we lay out here is the amount of unrealized FX hedging gains that we will unwind in the next year or two. Nigel Coe : Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Just one last inventory question. On the last call, you reduced inventory by about $70 million more than in Q3, but the margin impact was about 50 basis points less, is there -- is that what just simply because of the year-over-year comparison issue that you're speaking of or is that also because of which business lines you were reducing inventory in? Nick Gangestad : No, Laurence, it's solely a function of the comp that we're going against in 2018. Laurence Alexander : Okay, and then just to clarify the 200, 150 to 200 basis points, I think what that Nigel was referring to. I think some of the questions on the call I have framed it has a year, as a full-year impact. Is it a full-year impact or is it just a Q3 impact? Nick Gangestad : That was just a Q3 comments on the impact it's having on our total margin. Laurence Alexander : Okay, thank you. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Mike Roman : Thanks Laurence. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, I am pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter, which demonstrates the strength of the 3M model and our ability to perform across the business cycle. Moving forward, we are focused on delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders building on the momentum from our execution and results in Q3, driving strong cash flow and improving growth. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 28, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 business review and 2020 outlook. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2020 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 28, July 28 and October 27. Also note, we are planning to host an Investor Meeting in 2020. We will update you once we have finalized the date for the meeting. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, please note that throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in the fourth quarter and delivered results that were in line with our expectations. Although we continue to face growth challenges in certain end markets, our focus on productivity and cost management helped generate solid underlying margins and robust cash flow with a conversion rate of 186%. We also continue to build, invest, and transform for the long-term success of 3M. Earlier today, we issued a press release on the next big phase of our transformation journey, a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure, which I will discuss in more detail. Today, I will also provide an update on our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, including PFAS. Later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full year performance, including record cash flow and good progress on our strategic priorities along with our outlook for 2020 where we expect to return to growth. Please turn to Slide 5, where I will begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Organic growth company-wide in the fourth quarter was minus 2.6%, in line with our guidance. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive, and electronics, which impacted overall growth. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share, which includes a $0.20 Q4 restructuring charge that I will discuss shortly. Excluding that charge, we delivered EPS of $2.15 at the high end of our guidance. Finally, we generated underlying margins of 20.7%, which includes a 140 basis point impact from the Acelity acquisition, while reducing inventory levels by $115 million. Overall, I'm pleased with our team's execution and our ongoing progress in driving operational improvements. Please turn to Slide 6. I have talked to you often about the strength and vitality of the 3M value model. We have deep competitive advantages, unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, leading brands, and global capabilities, all of which make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. At the same time, we constantly evolve and build on our foundation, which we are doing through our four strategic priorities, including transformation. Over the last several years, we have been on a journey to transform how we serve our customers, how we work, and how we compete. The deployment of our ERP system has enabled new standardized business processes, new service models, and new digitalization capabilities across 3M. In EMEA and Canada, where we are furthest along in our transformation, we are seeing enhanced customer service, improved margins, better use of data analytics, and lower inventories. We are starting to see the same improvements in service, analytics, and inventories in the U.S. as well, which gives us continued confidence in our transformation journey. Importantly, our progress has enabled us to realign the company and further leverage our transformation capabilities. As you know, in April of last year, we moved from five to four business groups to better align around our customers and our four go-to-market models. This was the first step in our realignment. Since then, we have been working on reorganizing the entire company around our new business groups to take full advantage of our new capabilities. On January 1, we implemented a new streamlined global operating model designed to improve growth and operational efficiency. In the new model, our business groups now have full responsibility for all facets of strategy, portfolio and resource prioritization across our entire global operations. Under the prior model, area and country teams had responsibility for setting priorities in their respective regions, part of a distinct international organization. Now all of our international people report directly into the business groups and functions that they are part of, and there is no longer a separate international team. This new model has clear benefits to both 3M and our customers. First, it will drive more accountability to our business groups to strengthen performance and serve both global and local customers. Second, it will enable stronger customer insights in order to drive more powerful innovation. Third, it will empower our people with more freedom to make decisions and increase speed and service to our customers. Fourth, it will make us more efficient and help us continue to drive margin expansion by reducing layers, streamlining structure, and simplifying reporting lines. Finally, it will allow us to leverage similarities across markets, while maintaining the robust local capabilities and expertise that help differentiate 3M. 3M has both experience and success operating in a global model such as this. For several years, our electronics and auto OEM businesses have operated in a global model, and we've seen stronger customer alignment along with better service, innovation, and efficiency. In addition to our new model, we also made changes in 2019 to the way we support our business groups. To optimize the customer experience in each of our go-to-market models, we consolidated manufacturing, supply chain, and customer operations into a seamless end-to-end enterprise operations organization. This team plays a critical role in tailoring service and expertise to the needs of our customers and has been a key driver in enabling us to reduce inventory levels. We also brought together key capabilities around the world as part of a new global corporate affairs organization in order to advance our brand and reputation and build on our history as one of the best places to work around the world. As a result of these actions, today we are announcing a restructuring charge as we move quickly to our new alignment. The restructuring includes streamlining our organization by reducing approximately 1,500 positions spanning all business groups, functions, and geographies. On a pretax basis, we took a restructuring charge of $134 million in Q4, and we expect annual pretax savings of $110 million to $120 million, with $40 million to $50 million in 2020. In our new structure, we will also report geographic results under three areas beginning in Q1 2020 : the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific, with the same level of detail and transparency as we always have. Ultimately, as I've communicated to all 3M\u2019ers, this is a defining moment for our enterprise. We are modernizing how we run our business and building an organization for the future, and I'm more confident than ever in our journey to transform into a more agile, more efficient, and more competitive enterprise.  Please turn to Slide 7. Being a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship is core to 3M and is a value that matters deeply to our employees, our stakeholders and to me personally. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago, and we have continued to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges. Last year, we moved our St. Paul headquarters to 100% renewable electricity while committing to move our entire global operations to renewable energy by 2050. 3M also produces a broad range of solutions that help our customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from our smog-reducing roofing granules to our films that make homes, electronics and automobiles more energy-efficient. From a governance perspective, we are also strengthening oversight of strategies related to sustainability, R&D and commercialization. In November, our Board established a Science, Technology and Sustainability Committee to ensure we are building on our strong innovation capabilities while advancing our already high standards for product and environmental stewardship. This commitment to sustainability includes stewardship of water, one of our most precious resources. As part of our responsibility, we are proactively managing PFAS, guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency. We are committed to being part of the solution to ensure communities have confidence in their water. This includes addressing contamination at sites where we produced or disposed of PFAS. In addition, we will work with our customers and our other stakeholders in connection with other sites where PFAS concerns exist. Our efforts under these commitments led to a litigation-related pretax charge of $214 million in the fourth quarter, split roughly equally between the following two items : First, we updated our assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to our manufacture and disposal of PFAS, which included expanding our evaluation to other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS material. Second, we updated our assessment of customer-related litigation based on ongoing settlement discussions. At the same time, we continue to work with the EPA and other authorities to ensure we are fulfilling our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. As previously disclosed, in 2019, 3M discovered and voluntarily informed the EPA and appropriate state authorities that discharges from our Decatur, Alabama facility may not have complied with permit requirements. We immediately idled the relevant processes and took steps to address these issues. In connection with our Decatur disclosures, 3M received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama in late December 2019, and we are cooperating with this inquiry. In addition, in Q4 of 2019, as part of our compliance assessment of similar sites, we identified and also disclosed to the EPA and appropriate state authorities similar discharge issues at our Cordova, Illinois facility. We continue to support the EPA and the Alabama and Illinois state environmental authorities to help resolve these matters. We have a strong cross-functional team in place that is actively managing our environmental stewardship and PFAS. And moving forward, we will continue to update you as developments unfold. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our PFAS stewardship website, which can be found on our Investor Relations site under the heading About 3M. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with our 2020 guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8 with a recap of our fourth quarter sales performance. Fourth quarter organic sales declined 2.6%. Volumes were down 340 basis points, while selling prices were up 80 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 5.1 percentage points, while foreign currency translation was a 40 basis point headwind to sales. All-in fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars grew 2.1% versus last year. Looking at growth geographically. U.S. organic growth declined 3%, primarily due to declines in the Transportation and Electronics and Safety and Industrial businesses. Asia-Pacific declined 3% in Q4 with Japan down 7%, primarily due to a decline in our Electronics business. Organic growth was up 1% in China. This result is primarily due to last year's easier comparison. EMEA declined 3% while Latin America, Canada was flat. Please turn to Slide 9 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide fourth quarter sales were $8.1 billion with adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating margins were 19%, which included a negative 170 basis point impact from restructuring. Considering this impact fourth quarter operating margins were right in line with our expectations. On the right hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Lower organic volumes and our continued efforts to reduce inventories to improve cash flow were both headwinds to margins year-over-year. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from our Q2 restructuring actions. In total, these factors resulted in 110 basis point reduction to margins versus last year's fourth quarter. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 140 basis points mainly related to our acquisition of Acelity. Higher selling prices along with slightly lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to fourth quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 10 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $1.95 per share and as Mike noted included a $0.20 impact from our Q4 restructuring, which was not factored into our prior guidance. Accounting for this item, earnings were $2.15 per share, right in line with the high end of our guidance range. Looking at the components of our year-on-year earnings performance. The net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and other items I covered on the prior slide reduced fourth quarter per share earnings by $0.13. Acquisitions and divestitures combined, reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.11 per share versus last year, primarily due to Acelity. Please note that this result includes the impacts of both financing and tax costs. While early, Acelity is off to a good start as our team delivered results better than expected. Turning to tax rate. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.3% versus 20.5% last year. As noted with acquisitions, M&A and restructuring categories in this table include their own year-on-year tax impacts with the remaining impact of $0.05 reflected in this line. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1.7% versus Q4 last year, adding $0.03 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 11 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter free cash flow of $1.8 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 10% to $5.4 billion as our teams delivered strong working capital management throughout 2019. Fourth quarter conversion was 186%, which included a 27 percentage point benefit from the significant litigation-related charges. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $538 million, with the full year totaling $1.7 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. And for the full year, we returned $4.7 billion. Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which declined 2.8% organically in the quarter. Our Personal Safety and Industrial Minerals businesses delivered mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while the balance of the portfolio declined. Looking geographically, organic growth increased in Latin America, Canada while Asia-Pacific, the U.S. and EMEA each declined. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter operating margins were 20.9%. Overall, margins continued to be solid when considering negative organic growth, inventory reductions and restructuring impacts. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. As expected, fourth quarter sales were down 5.9% organically compared to last year, impacted by end market softness worldwide. Our electronics-related businesses showed sequential improvement, despite year-over-year being down mid-single digits organically as demand remained soft in consumer electronics and factory automation end markets. Our automotive OEM business was down 5%, a bit better than fourth quarter global car and light truck builds, which were down 6%. Transportation and Electronics fourth quarter operating margins were 20.8%. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales, inventory reductions and restructuring. Turning to our Health Care business. Organic growth was flat year-over-year against last year's strong comparison. Growth was led by mid single-digit increases in health information systems and food safety. Medical Solutions, our largest business was up slightly, while oral care declined low single-digits in the quarter. Looking geographically, growth was led by Latin America, Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined. Health Care fourth quarter operating margins were 21.3%, impacted by nearly 8 percentage points from the combination of the M Modal and Acelity acquisitions along with restructuring. Taking these factors into account, margins were up 100 basis points year-over-year. Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was flat. Sales were led by mid-single-digit growth in home improvement and low single-digit growth in home care, while stationery and office and consumer declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, Latin America/Canada grew mid-single digits. The U.S. was up nearly 1%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific declined. Consumer's operating margins were a strong 23.4%, up 3 percentage point year-over-year, driven by portfolio and footprint actions we have been executing in this business. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Nick. As I look at 2019, I'm encouraged how our team responded to the challenges we faced in our end markets : stepping up our execution, improving operations and driving strong cash flow as we move through the year. We finalized the restructuring we announced in April, effectively managed costs and reduced inventory levels by $370 million. With respect to the full year numbers, organic growth company-wide was minus 1.5%. We posted adjusted earnings of $9.10 per share, which included a $0.21 benefit from the divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We increased cash flow by 10% year-over-year to $5.4 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise, while delivering a strong conversion rate of 118%. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18%, including the impact of acquisitions. In 2019, we also returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. Please turn to Slide 14. Beyond financial results, I view 2019 as a fundamentally significant year for 3M as we implemented major change to position us well for the future. Earlier, I talked about how we are accelerating the pace of our transformation, and we also made significant progress on our other three priorities for long-term growth and value creation. I'll make a few comments on each, starting with portfolio. The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value across our company. Since 2012, we have moved from 40 businesses to 23, while completing more than 10 divestitures and 14 acquisitions. In 2019, we continued portfolio, with particular progress in strengthening our Health Care business. We acquired Acelity, which accelerates 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, along with MModal's technology business, an ideal fit within our health information systems business. The integration of Acelity is going well, and the business is off to a good start. And M Modal is outperforming our expectations for both growth and income. We also announced that we will divest our drug delivery business, which will enable us to focus more resources on our core Health Care portfolio. Beyond our efforts in Health Care, last year, we sold our gas and flame detection business. And earlier this month, we finalized the sale of our ballistic-protection business. Managing our portfolio is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to act on opportunities to maximize value across 3M. Our next priority is innovation, which is the heart of our enterprise. It differentiates 3M in the marketplace and supports organic growth and our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital. In 2019, we invested $3.6 billion in the combination of R&D and CapEx. These investments enable us to invent unique products and solutions and then deliver them efficiently to our customers through our disruptive manufacturing process technologies. That it is more than the breadth of our technology that sets us apart. It's also our ability to share, combine and apply our technologies across 3M businesses. Our adhesives, for example, are in cars and airplanes, electronics and medical tapes and in the products you're most familiar with, such as Command strips and Post-it notes. And as the needs of our customers evolve, we constantly develop new capabilities and applications to stay at the forefront of innovation. Last year, we expanded our periodic table to 51 technology platforms as we further refined our expertise in areas like meta-materials, computer vision and advanced robotics. We also continue to see strong returns from investments in our priority growth platforms, which serve emerging and fast-growing markets. For the full year, these platforms grew 10% as we create differentiated solutions for customers around health care, transportation, safety and infrastructure. For example, automotive electrification grew 9% as we continue to drive good penetration, with particular strength in automotive displays and lightweighting solutions. Going forward, we will continue to use 3M innovation to solve tough problems for our customers, improve people's lives and help create a more sustainable world. Turning now to people and culture, which is foundational to each of our other priorities. In 2019, we took significant action to develop our people and invigorate our culture, and the transformation initiatives I discussed earlier are at the center of our efforts. Our transformation journey is as much a cultural change as it is a technology change. We are simplifying workflows, equipping our people with new systems and tools and empowering them with more autonomy to make faster decisions. Given the level of transformation within 3M, a key focus of our development is managing change, and I am pleased how our team is stepping up to embrace these changes. At the same time, we are deepening our commitment to 3M's core values, including diversity and inclusion, 60% of our top 100 leaders are diverse, one-third of our corporate officers and Board members are women, and we are doing more to integrate inclusion into our daily life. Of course, underpinning everything we do is our code of conduct. And last year, 3M again was named one of the world's most ethical companies. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made against each of our strategic priorities in 2019, and I am confident in how we are positioned heading into 2020. Please turn to Slide 15. As a result of our work, we are well positioned to return to growth in 2020. Our plan reflects our improved performance and expectation for low but positive global macroeconomic growth. We anticipate organic growth of flat to 2%, along with earnings of $9.30 to $9.75 per share. We expect another year of robust cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. Finally, we anticipate a strong return on invested capital of 18% to 21%. In the appendix of our slide presentation, you will find additional details on our guidance, including a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group and area. Before turning to Q&A, I have one additional announcement. Our Executive Vice President of International, Julie Bushman, has informed us of her intent to retire in April. Throughout her 36 years at 3M, Julie has been an exceptional leader and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. Julie's leadership has been invaluable throughout her time leading our international team, including her role and working closely with me to lead the transformation announcements we discussed today. I thank Julie for her many years of service and many contributions. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Davis : Hey good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : As far as the \u2013 I mean, there's some noise out there with this virus in China and stuff, and you sell a fair amount of products into \u2013 that benefit, but at the same time, there's some offsets and slower growth in China overall. But when you think about, Mike, the cadence of returning growth in 2020, is there a sense of when? Is it 1Q as you start to get into some easier comps or is it more towards the back end of the year? Mike Roman : So Scott, I would start with the model for returning growth in 2020 is based on that broader macro, that outlook for the broader macro. It also is looking at some of those key markets that we talked about that were challenges for us in 2019. China, for example, one of the challenges in 2019. We see that in our model for 2020 returning to low-to-mid single-digit growth for the total year. In both cases, I would say, we see growth strengthening as we move through the year. So Q1, positive growth for the overall enterprise in the middle range \u2013 middle of the overall guidance of the range, maybe a little slightly lower end of the guidance of the range. And China, in particular, before we got to the last couple of weeks with the coronavirus really becoming the focus, we were looking at a sluggish start to China in first quarter really based on automotive, and the build rate's expected to be down mid-single digits and maybe even high-single digits. And so it's \u2013 that was kind of our pacing. Now coronavirus, it's kind of changing things as we go and we're seeing what you're seeing. We're seeing increased demand for our respiratory protection products, and we're ramping up our production worldwide, in China, around the world to meet that demand. At the same time, we're seeing what everybody else is seeing, that there's \u2013 the businesses are shutting down, extending their shutdown beyond Lunar New Year. So, we're really watching day to day what that's going to mean for our outlook for China, but I'll give you kind of the frame we had and then how we're kind of looking at it as we see the updates day by day. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And just as a quick follow-up. Will Acelity be accretive to your growth rate in 2020? Will that be above your guidance range in your view? Nick Gangestad : So Scott, this is Nick. We \u2013 Acelity is, of course, incorporated in the guidance that we're giving there. Throughout the year, most of its growth will be coming through what we report for acquisitions versus organic growth, but when we compare it to the underlying growth that was a revenue that was there before we acquired it, we see its growth as accretive to the overall 3M growth rate that we're projecting. Scott Davis : Okay, super helpful. Thanks, good luck guys. Mike Roman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hey, so just wanted to touch on the additional PFAS charge here. I mean I think I understand the Alabama and Illinois plant issues, but what's the trigger for the customer litigation charge? I mean, obviously, there has to be a trigger to get you to recognize that charge. Maybe just touch on \u2013 there's obviously a speculation about EPA regulation. Where do you stand on that issue? Mike Roman : Yes. So maybe I'll take the charge first, Nigel. So, we played out in the prepared remarks that there are two aspects to the charge. One is our ongoing commitment to resolve the issues where we manufacture and dispose the PFAS. The other part of the charge is related to really ongoing negotiations with customers. As part of our commitment is to do our part to help customers address the PFAS issues they face, and we've got our negotiations and mediation as far enough along that we can identify what's probable and estimable around a group of customers. It's multiple customers. It does account for the Wolverine cases that we've been \u2013 we've talked about in the past, but it's multiple customers, and really the next step of what we can understand is probable and estimable. So then in working with \u2013 one of the commitments we did make in last fall is to work in support of the EPA as we move forward with their regulatory plan around PFAS. They've got a \u2013 they've laid out a plan to move forward. We are working to support that with our investment in research and understanding \u2013 helping the understanding of PFAS, providing our data and really doing things like helping to provide a clearinghouse for all of the information and data around PFAS. And so, we continue to be working in support of the EPA in our work on our resolving, our manufacturing disposal sites, and then also on moving the regulatory standards forward. Nigel Coe : Thank you. A quick follow-on on the 2020 guidance. On the cash flow, the $5.3 billion to $6 billion of free cash, are you simply assuming delevering of the balance sheet in the bridge? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Nigel, we\u2019re not \u2013 as we ended 2019, we had debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly \u2013 just a little over 2.5 times. We see that coming down probably about 50 basis points to be two or just slightly over two times debt to EBITDA, so that's part of our overall capital structure planning in 2020. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Mike, can you expand a little bit on the commentary on this, the new restructuring initiatives that you have in place and how that differs from business transformation, fully recognizing that it sounds like you're streamlining the organization as well? But any additional color you can provide there would be helpful. (Auidt End) Mike Roman : Yes. And Joe, what I laid out is really the next phase of our transformation journey, and it's taking advantage of everything that we've done, deploying the ERP, the ecosystem around it, the service models that we put in place, the capabilities, the technical capabilities to really manage our business, digitize a lot of what we do to manage our operations and our business processes. And so it became clear that we could take full advantage of that with how we operate our businesses globally. And last spring, we announced moving from five to four businesses. At the time, it was \u2013 it looked like a realignment of the company, but where does it go? And this is really the next part of the story. We aligned around our customers and our go-to-market models. And with the launch in the new year of the new model, we are going to operate globally around those go-to-market models. And that includes how we operate our businesses everywhere around the world. It includes taking advantage of the capabilities we put in place with business transformation, and then It also includes this really consolidation of our manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations end-to-end to really optimize for those go-to-market models. So it's a significant change in really how we align the customers, how we bring our innovation to market, how we streamline and simplify 3M around the world. It is taking advantage of business transformation, but it's really transformation, but it's really multiplying that impact as we move ahead. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thank you. And then maybe just my follow-on, focused on the Transportation and Electronics segment. Clearly, that's a segment that has \u2013 had a tough 2019, and I think that there's some optimism in 2020 that we'll potentially start to see a rebound, particularly in the electronics side of things. And so if we were to start to see better growth, what kind of operating leverage would you guys expect to see out of that business? And in your commentary, Mike, earlier around positive organic growth in the first quarter, is this a segment that is also going to be positive in Q1? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Joe, let me take that one. First of all from \u2013 to the second part of your question, Transportation and Electronics, for the year we've guided that negative 2% to positive 2% organic growth. Our view right now, as we see all four quarters in that range. Right now, and just to go a little off track, the Safety and Industrial business is the only one that we see a potential that that one would be below its range in the first quarter and then in the next three quarters within the range that we've guided. As far as leverage that we expect in Transportation and Electronics, this is one of the businesses where as we see us returning to growth in that, that this would be accretive and would be adding to our leverage that we see that. A specific percentage, we typically don't put out, but it would be beneficial and we'd see the margins, the accretive margins there very similar to what we see for the total company, that as we rebuild the revenue there that we would be seeing that maybe an extra 10% going to increasing the margin as that \u2013 as the revenue improves there. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Mike Roman : Good morning, David. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. Can you provide details on how your core gross margin will trend in 2020 given the unusual inventory related effect in 2019? Nick Gangestad : Yes. The gross margins and our overall margins, but a part of \u2013 a big part of it will be our \u2013 through our gross margin improvement. We see overall operating margins improving 50 basis points to 100 basis points in 2020. And in the first quarter, we expect them to be roughly flat prior to the impact of Acelity. Acelity, we again \u2013 we \u2013 because that was not part of our base in the first quarter, we expect that will be a negative impact to our total company margins of about 100 basis points in the first quarter, and will impact Health Care's margins by 400 basis points to 500 basis points in the first quarter. But the underlying margins in first quarter, excluding that we see roughly flat and then some expansion, because our primary inventory reductions that we were executing were occurring in the second, third and fourth quarter. And as we move into that that range then we \u2013 that's when we expect to be seen margin expansion, particularly gross margin expansion in 2020. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And for the follow-up, what are the sort of tailwinds do you see within Health Care? And do you see potential upside to the 2% to 4% organic guidance for the full year as you get to the second half of the year? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. If you look at 2020 David, Health Care is going to be a leader for growth for us and that is really on some of the strengths that we saw coming out of 2019. We see continued strength in health information systems and with the M Modal addition being part of that in our food-safety business. Our medical solutions business, we see that benefiting from the strong market \u2013 outlook for market growth in Health Care. And so we see, and I would say, continued strength in developing markets helping to lead that growth forward. So it's some of the areas that we saw strengths in 2019 and then some of the things that we've been able to build upon with our acquisitions and leverage even stronger positions against a good macroeconomic outlook. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Nick Gangestad : Hey, John. Mike Roman : Good morning John. John Inch : Good morning guys. Nick, can we start on the EPS road map, Slide 27? So you've dialed in minus $0.25 for 2019 headwinds. I think it's interesting. It's not a range. It's an exact precise number. What exactly is in that? For example, like our compensation headwinds, so having to pay people more money, is that in there? And anything you could say on that? Was there flex around it? What is going on there? Nick Gangestad : Yes, John, there's two precise things in there, which is why it's not a range. About one-third of that is from gains we took in 2019 on disposal of certain properties, certain assets we had, that I talked about during our third quarter earnings call. The other two-thirds of that, John, is coming from variable compensation. With our results that were delivering \u2013 delivered in 2019, our variable comp is below our planned variable comp level. And we've built our plan for 2020 that we would be returning to planned variable comp. And that's why we're calling that out as a 2019 headwind. John Inch : And can I ask you, Nick why is that fixed? For instance, let's just say the economy got better as 2020 progressed and you did much better than your zero to 2% core growth. Does that variable number also not dial up? Or is it kind of a fixed bonus? Like, why wouldn't the $0.25 possibly dial a little bit higher as a drag? Nick Gangestad : Yes. So in 2020, if we start to see our compensation being different than that, then our normal practice would be that becomes part of productivity. So if we are paying more than our planned variable comp that would become a headwind to our productivity that we're projecting in 2020. John Inch : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, can you remind us what's going on \u2013 or Mike. What's going on in Europe? I had in my notes \u2013 I thought that you were sort of on deck to maybe downsize your European footprint, I think pro forma, like about a third of production facilities, with a lot of this happening in the back half of 2019. Where do we stand on that? And I noticed that, for instance, Europe, on the core sequentially got worse. Was that actually \u2013 was that self-inflicted because of this associated internal disruption or actions? Or is there something else? Just is it just macro in Europe? Just where do we stand in Europe overall and the runway even to your 20% plus margins that you talked about at the last Analyst Meeting, Nick? Nick Gangestad : Yes. John thanks for asking that question. And there are several moving parts in there. First, let me talk to the margin, and then I'll talk to the growth. 2019 was a very good year of progress for us with our operating income margins again expanding in Europe to approximately 19%, very much along the trajectory that we were projecting that we would be on to be moving this to a 20% operating income margin by 2020. As part of that, we've been taking a number of action over the last few years. Some of them had been footprint actions, and we are starting to see some of that benefit manifest in our 2019 results going forward into 2020. Also, there's been some portfolio adjustments, where there are certain product lines where we've been going through and prioritizing and deciding either to exit or to de-prioritize and de-resource. And as we look at our organic growth in 2019 as well as, in particular, you're asking about fourth quarter of 2019, that's been impacted, impacted by 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth by some of our \u2013 what we have planned and done from a portfolio standpoint as part of our move to shift our portfolio in Europe. Much of the rest has been macro of what we're seeing. Plus, a little bit right now what we're seeing in the fourth quarter is a comparison that we're going against fourth quarter last year in Europe. This was very much in the range we're expecting. But macro, we're continuing to see auto builds down in Europe, and that does impact our overall EMEA results. John Inch : But EMEA is up. Do you think it hits your 20% target in 2020 or maybe even a little bit better? Nick Gangestad : Yes. We see ourselves very much in-line to be hitting that. Could be a little ahead, but I wouldn't get too far ahead on that. We see ourselves right in line to be hitting that. John Inch : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, Mike, I was hoping to circle back on the restructuring announcement today, and I wanted to put it in context with what we're seeing across the multi-industry sector, where a number of companies are pursuing simplification via larger spinouts, bigger, bolder moves versus kind of what I would characterize, 3M has been more surgical. Have you looked \u2013 as a result, you look more like an outlier in terms of your simplification approach. Is it \u2013 what's your response there? Is it really company-specific? Are there opportunities to do something bigger? Is that \u2013 might be another next phase? But if you could give us some color there, that would be helpful. Mike Roman : Yes, Deane. We \u2013 what I framed it up is this is part of our transformation journey. And if you look back, even back to the Investor Day in November of 2018, we laid out a plan for margin improvement over the coming years, and a big part of that was from transformation. So there was a plan by us to really keep moving forward in this. This announcement today is the next phase of that plan to move forward with an alignment around those four go-to-market models, our customers, better leverage all the business transformation investments we put in place. And we are optimizing as we go. We're building on the capabilities we've put in place. You saw that in 2019 start to come through our EMEA and Canada results in terms of margins and service and inventory management improving there. We \u2013 it was part of getting on top of inventory in North America, too, as we deployed the new capabilities. And so I wouldn't call it a \u2013 I wouldn't think of it as a one-step in the middle of this. It's part of our transformation journey. And so we'll continue to optimize off of this. This is \u2013 enables \u2013 the charge that we took in Q4 enables us to move quickly to the alignment, get the full benefit of it as we go forward. It's really, we think, going to be an important part of what positions us to deliver growth and better efficiency as we go through 2020 and beyond. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. And then just staying on the restructuring, the payback for 2019, did \u2013 that's $40 million to $50 million in savings. Just based upon the size of the restructuring that seems a slower payback, does that have more to do with the timing of how you'll do these reductions? Nick Gangestad : Yes, Deane, that really is a function of this. As we move to streamline the \u2013 our operations there, not all of it is happening right away. There's parts of it that phase in over the course of the year, and that's why it's only having a $40 million to $50 million impact. Some of it, a minority position, part of that will come in the first half of the year. The vast majority of that $40 million to $50 million comes in the second half of the year. Deane Dray : Got it. Thanks helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. John Walsh : Yes, good morning. Mike Roman : Hey John. Nick Gangestad : Hey John. John Walsh : Wanted to talk about the price performance in the quarter and specific to the U.S., but happy if you want to broaden it out. As we think about that 1.7% price increase, that's a higher number than we've seen here in the past. Is that priced because of innovation and sustainable? Or did you hold price, and that was kind of impacting why the volume was down in the U.S.? Nick Gangestad : John, the price growth \u2013 first of all, let me expand it to the full year for U.S. price growth. With that 1.7%, that brings our full year price growth to 80 basis points. John, I think that's the more helpful number for you to look at and focus on. Often in a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's going to be what is it comparing to in the quarter in the prior year. So I won't overreact to the 1.7%. Our view is the 80 basis points that we did in the U.S. in total 2019, that's indicative of what we're doing. And to the first premise of your question, what we overall see in price growth is a function of the value we are creating. It's the innovation we have in our products and continuing to update the product lines and the products that we offer there. And that is a big driver of that. But I won't focus on the 1.7%. I'd focus more on the full year, the 80 basis points. John Walsh : Got you. And then maybe coming at the flat to up 2% organic just a different way. If we think about 2019, particularly on the automotive side, you did have some impact from channel inventory destocking. I don't know if it's possible, but have you thought about what the growth rate would look like just with the absence of those headwinds? And how much of that kind of flat to 2% is just a normalization versus the macro getting any better? Mike Roman : John, the return to growth of zero to 2% that is really reflecting both the macro and then I think a closer look at the markets that we've been challenged within 2019. So electronics, automotive, China. And in 2019, as you noted, there was an impact from channel reactions. As they saw the decline in those markets, they reacted, took out inventory. So part of the year-over-year, in those markets, comparison is going to be a more stable channel. We do see more balanced inventory in those channels. I would say electronics; we're seeing the early signs of maybe some encouraging outlook in areas like semiconductor, fabrication and data centers. In automotive, the outlook for the year is still negative build rates. Slightly negative, I think, is the broader economic view. We're a little more conservative than that in a slower start to the year. But again, I would say our view is \u2013 also has that idea of balanced inventory in the face of those outlooks. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Hey Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, can we go back to Health Care for a second? I know that you changed the reporting last year and put separation and purification, and that's continuing the growth a little bit. But you, I'm sure, recall that Health Care was supposed to be a 2% to 4% grower in 2019 and reported a little under 2% and the 4% to 6% through 2023. So I know you're saying 2% to 4% for 2020. Has the impact on Health Care just been, I guess, unexpected cyclicality? Or have you sort of reassessed the long-term growth of the business? And is there any sort of thought about accelerating portfolio optimization in that particular business beyond selling drug delivery? Mike Roman : Well, Andy, I would say, as I highlighted in my speech, we have been focused with our portfolio actions on Health Care. As you mentioned, drug delivery and the plan to divest that, adding Acelity, adding M Modal into our health information systems. And if you go back to Q4, the growth \u2013 organic growth in Q4 was positive across most of the portfolio. It was led by mid-single-digit growth in health information systems and food safety. Medical solutions was up slightly in the quarter. Oral care declined in the low single digits. And so that was maybe the focus of the softer growth in Q4. We did see strong growth geographically in areas like China and other parts of the world. So that's kind of what we carry into 2020. And we see medical solutions improving. The market outlook there is strong, and our position is strong. We see health information, food safety continuing. We see separation and purification getting a little better. And so we \u2013 all of that together positions us in a stronger growth for the outlook for the total year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful. And then, Nick, just looking at the walk for 2020 again. Do you still see the potential for additional property sales? So there may be an element of conservatism in that item. And then you talked about a pretty wide range for this year in terms of productivity impacts from zero to $0.25. It seems that's like a little higher than usual. Is productivity more dependent on what organic growth is this year and that's why it's a little hard to pin down in 2020? Nick Gangestad : Andy, I just want to make sure you asked, where the potential for other property sales and if that's what you said, no, we're not anticipating anything of any material magnitude on gains or losses from property sales in 2020. In terms of the range that we have for productivity between zero and 25% \u2013 $0.25, that's might be a little wider than normal. And I think it does reflect as we're coming off a year where our margins were declining as we were having noticeable drops in inventory as well as we're going through the transformation and the restructuring charges we've called out and isolated the restructuring charges, but that's also a driver of our productivity and we're isolating that, and just the interplay of that adds a little more complexity for that. And we see the zero to $0.25 is like our best estimate right now. And of course we're going to be striving to be on the higher end of that, but it's where we are building our plans right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning Josh. Nick Gangestad : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a follow-up on Andy's question a little bit on productivity, maybe slightly a different way. I guess Nick, how does zero end up in the range? You mentioned kind of the under-absorption and destocking issues, which I think caught you by surprise in the first quarter of last year, in particular on the volume drop. What would be the driver of the lower end of that range? Is it \u2013 if demand is better and like you said the incentive comp is a hit to productivity? Just trying to understand what the downside could be or what even drive the pressures to that? Nick Gangestad : Josh a couple of things. First of all, as would typically be the expectation if our growth is on the lower end of our range, I think that puts a little pressure to us on the lower end of the productivity range that we've laid out here, and included in that productivity range there's positive things that we're doing such as where we're seeing where the utilization of our factories in comparison to 2019. But it's also \u2013 we're also facing into as we do every year wage inflation so offsetting wage inflation is part of that. We also have other things that are impacted in there. For example, what we've called out under other and other pension expense that hits the non-offline is being flat year-on-year. Included in our productivity there is a between $0.06 and $0.07 headwind for increased pension expenses, that's part of that productivity number. So there is a negative headwind \u2013 there is headwinds we're facing and there as we face a zero to 25%. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the demand outlook. I think clearly there is an expectation maybe a few months ago that we were on this kind of linear recovery and maybe a mid-year bigger inflection in demand across the industrial universe. It seems like January has been a little slower for everyone. If you guys had a snap the line today versus some of the potential may be green shoots you could have been seeing 30 days or 60 days ago, as anything seen pushed out or off track or is this just kind of a timing issue and we shouldn't read anything into January? Mike Roman : Josh, I think you laid it out. The way we looked at that low growth macroeconomic especially in industrial, industrial production index kind of view of that it was getting better as we went through the year. That's the way we built our outlook for the year, our plan. I would say the biggest change since that has been what's going on in China. And it's \u2013 that will be the \u2013 have the biggest impact on how the first quarter plays out and then how we move further into the year. So I think that's the most important thing to be watching out. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Just a quick question following up on inventories. I think Nick or Mike; you'd said that you had a $370 million drawdown in 2019 overall. Maybe just help us understand what the margin impact of that drawdown was for the full year 2019. And also, as you sit here today, do you view your channel inventories that your customers and partners as being fairly normal? Or is there a bit more to go of destock in Q1? And then, switching back to 3M itself on inventory, do you have that old medium-term goal of a $500 million reduction, where do we stand on that? Nick Gangestad : Julian, several questions all at once. So first of all, on the $370 million of inventory reduction, our estimate that that's negatively impacted our operating margins or our gross margins in 2019 by 50 basis points to 100 basis points. That's true both for the fourth quarter and also true for the full year about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And we see that flipping to be part \u2013 that's part of our guidance of the margin improvement in 2020 is having that headwind behind us. As far as channel inventories, there's always some puts and takes. I'd say we're seeing nothing abnormal right now with channel inventories. We have, of course as we've said throughout the year we've seen some reductions in our inventory \u2013 channel held inventories, but right now, I'd characterize it is fairly normal where we stand with inventories. And then we \u2013 in 2020 we do anticipate that we will bring down inventories a bit more, nothing on the magnitude of the $370 million that we did in 2019, but we expect we will be \u2013 we'll continue our progress of taking down our inventories slightly in 2020. As far as the guidance we had given prior of $500 million. We see the progress that we made in 2019 as most of that reduction getting us back to where we were when we first said that and some of that starting to make progress on that $500 million. We still see opportunities in the coming years for us to operate our supply chain even more efficiently and gather even more of that $500 million inventory reduction through our cash flow in the coming years. We've made some progress in 2019, we'll make more in 2020 and we'll make more in 2021. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up. In the fourth quarter, we leveraged the strengths of the 3M business model to navigate market conditions while delivering strong cash flow and solid margins. We also continue to make significant progress on our transformation journey with the rollout of our new operating model. We enter 2020 in a strong strategic and financial position poised to return to growth and deliver value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

I thank all of our people for your tireless efforts and your incredible work. At 3M, we have a unique and critical responsibility in pandemic preparedness and response. Our response throughout COVID-19 has been guided by our purpose as an enterprise and shaped by these three principles. First an uncompromising commitment to the safety of our employees; second, fighting the pandemic with urgency from all angles, including everything we're doing to help protect health care workers and first responders; and third, maintaining business continuity, executing actions to deliver for our customers and shareholders and to lead out of the economic slowdown. Please turn to slide 5. In January, we mobilized 3M's crisis action team to coordinate our response to COVID-19. This team meets daily to ensure we are addressing our highest priorities, which as I mentioned starts with protecting the safety and well-being of our people. Our learnings from China which was impacted by the virus first helped guide our actions worldwide and made a significant difference in our ability to rapidly prepare and respond. We moved quickly to implement remote work, where possible across the enterprise. And today approximately half of our employees are working from home including myself. In our plants and other facilities where remote work isn't feasible we have instituted robust safety protocols. These include stringent, cleaning and medical screening, along with staggering shifts and reorganizing how we work to increase social distancing. COVID-19 is impacting all of us, both professionally and personally. But for some it's much more serious than others. For 3Mers personally affected by the virus, we have implemented pandemic support policies to help protect their pay and benefits and allow them to take care of themselves and their families. The situation is changing daily sometimes hourly, and we will continue to assess the safety of our people and facilities to ensure their well-being and comply with government directives. Please turn to Slide 6. As we protect our own employees, we continue to work urgently to protect the public, including health care workers and first responders. 3M is a longtime leader in personal safety with a range of science-based solutions for respiratory, face, hearing and fall protection, which goes to the heart of our vision of improving every life. This includes our N95 respirators, which 3M pioneered nearly 50 years ago and which we have continuously refined and improved ever since. Our largest production of N95 respirators is in the U.S. at two plants in South Dakota and Nebraska. And we also manufacture them in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. After SARS in the early 2000s, we made the decision to prepare for future crises by investing in significant surge capacity at each of our respirator plants around the world. This additional capacity has largely remained idle for the last two decades, except for emergencies such as H1N1, the Japanese tsunami and wildfires in California and Australia. As you know, compared to prior emergencies, COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented explosion in demand. When the virus broke out, we were able to immediately activate our surge capacity and maximize production to support the public health response. Beginning in January, 3M doubled our global output of N95 respirators to 1.1 billion per year or about 100 million per month, including 35 million per month in the U.S. We've made additional investments and are also working with the Department of Defense to double annual production once again to two billion by the end of this year with additional capacity already beginning to come online. In the U.S., we will be producing N95 respirators at a rate of roughly 50 million per month in June, a 40% increase from current levels. We are also partnering with other companies on innovative solutions to protect those on the front lines. In collaboration with multiple sterilization companies, we have introduced new methods for hospitals to safely clean and reuse their N95 respirators. We are also working with Ford and Cummins to expand production of 3M's powered air purifying respirators with a plan to increase capacity by tenfold within the next 60 to 90 days. Protecting people in this crisis is not just a 3M challenge; it's an industry-wide challenge. Even with 3M's accelerated production the stark reality is that global demand for respirators far outpaces the ability of the entire industry to deliver. That is why as we urgently expand capacity, we are also prioritizing and triaging our supplies to the most critical needs. We move quickly within days of regulatory approval to redirect more than 90% of our respirators into health care with the rest deployed to other critical industries such as energy and food. Within individual regions and countries, we are working with government agencies such as FEMA and distribution partners to identify and serve hotspots. In addition as the pandemic unfolds in different stages globally, we are working with governments to address trade restrictions and regulatory standards, so we can redirect supplies around the world. For example, in early April, 3M and the U.S. government announced a plan to import 166 million respirators, primarily from our plant in China. 20 million of these respirators have already shipped via the FEMA airbridge, with a total of 40 million expected by the end of this month. This would not have been possible without the partnership of the White House. I would like to thank the President and his team for their leadership, the FDA for extending its emergency use authorization and FEMA for their work in expediting the import of product to the U.S. This plan is enabling us to maximize support for the U.S. and other areas in urgent need including Europe, Central and Latin America and Canada. We also continue to aggressively fight fraud, price gouging and other illegal and unethical activity. 3M has not and would never raise prices as a result of this crisis. And we are executing a multi-pronged strategy to pursue and deter unscrupulous behavior that is causing real harm to the public. We created a fraud hotline, published our list prices for N95 respirators and are collaborating closely with partners to ensure that supply chains are secure. While virtually all of those engaging in predatory practices have no relationship with 3M, we have in a few instances terminated distributors in our industrial channel for acting unethically or in violation of their agreements. We have also filed multiple lawsuits and continue to make referrals to law enforcement, take down counterfeit websites and remove deceptive social media posts. Beyond personal protective equipment, 3M Science is leading the fight against COVID-19 in other significant areas as well. We are providing biopharma filtration and purification solutions to support the development of vaccines and therapeutics, including multiple drugs in current trials. Our advanced membrane technology is being utilized in blood oxygenation procedures and medical devices, vital treatments for some of the sickest patients. We are helping hospitals in New York City and elsewhere quickly connect their temporary facilities and are providing leading software and coding solutions at no cost during this critical period of time, enabling frontline workers to better manage the surge in patient volume. 3M has also donated $20 million to support health care workers, vulnerable populations and scientific research. In summary, I am proud of how 3M is helping lead the fight against COVID-19 and we have launched a comprehensive website on 3M.com with more details on our response and other valuable information. Please turn to Slide 7. 3M is leading from a position of strength. And in these challenging times the benefits of our business model have never been clearer. We are a science and manufacturing powerhouse with strong capabilities and brands across the world with our greatest capabilities here in the United States. In the U.S., we have nearly 80 manufacturing plants and distribution centers, anchoring communities in 29 states across the country. 3M has never left our home country and has continuously expanded our U.S. capabilities. Over half of our research and development and capital investments are in the U.S. And every year we export $5 billion in goods to other nations from our robust U.S. manufacturing base. At the same time over the decades we have also built out robust capabilities around the world, to be close to customers and better serve the unique needs of regional and local markets. These global capabilities include plants and distribution centers in 54 countries along with three global R&D centers in Asia and Europe. In this crisis, our model has enabled us to respond with agility and add scale including the rapid deployment of personal safety equipment that we just talked about. It is also enabling us to maintain business continuity, continue to serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain, which brings me to Slide 8. I am pleased how our team is managing through the pandemic and adjusting our operations to the realities of this fast-changing situation. This includes working closely with our customers to modify our supply and demand plans. Our critical sites are fully operational, though we have implemented some targeted plant or line shutdowns due to weak customer demand or government mandates. Overall, as of late April, roughly three quarters of our plants and distribution centers, remain fully or partially operational. And to support 3Mers impacted by shutdowns, we have implemented a short-term paid furlough program. In this crisis, I'm especially encouraged of the benefits we are seeing from the new global operating model we rolled out at the start of this year. As part of our new model, we consolidated manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations into a seamless end-to-end enterprise operations organization. This team is enabling us to maintain strong customer service, streamlined decision-making and adjust faster than ever to the external environment. As an example, we have reduced our production planning cycle times by 70% across our portfolio of businesses. In addition, our new corporate affairs organization has increased our collaboration with governments around the world while enhancing our employee and community engagement. Beyond our operations, we are also executing financial actions to deliver 2020 and set us up for success in 2021 and beyond. We are maintaining critical investments in organic growth through R&D, including in personal safety and other priority areas. At the same time, we are aggressively managing costs, a continuation of our relentless focus on efficiency and productivity improvements. We have already implemented sharp spending reductions, including a global hiring freeze, limiting our use of temporary contract workers and cutting indirect costs across the enterprise. In total, we expect these reductions to result in cost savings of $350 million to $400 million in the second quarter. We're also adjusting CapEx plans as we delay or experience slowdowns in certain projects. And we have suspended our share repurchase programs as of March 20. Importantly, we remain committed to our dividend as a high priority for capital allocation. Overall, these steps will help protect our company as we manage through this uncertain period and we are prepared to respond with additional actions as needed. Please turn to Slide 9 Given the diversity of our businesses, the financial impact of COVID-19 is mixed across 3M. Some areas of our portfolio are experiencing high demand while others are facing steep declines. In the first quarter we saw strong growth in personal safety as well as in other areas such as home improvement, retail cleaning products, food safety and biopharma filtration. At the same time, we saw weak demand in several other end markets with the biggest slowdowns in oral care, automotive, aerospace and general industrial. The slowdowns in these markets accelerated in the second half of March, as many countries began to shut down their economies. With respect to geographic trends, we saw mixed performance across Asia Pacific, with significant declines early in the year and gradual improvement in March. The Americas held steady through most of the quarter with the U.S. up 4%. Though beginning in mid-March, we saw a significant deceleration in both the Americas and EMEA. All in, we delivered organic growth company-wide of 30 basis points, along with adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, solid margins of 21% and a double-digit increase in cash flow. In summary, I'm confident in our ability to lead through this crisis and emerge even stronger. Our execution against our four strategic priorities : portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture, has positioned us well leading into this downturn. Going forward, a continued focus on these priorities, combined with the actions we are taking, will enable us to deliver even greater value for our customers, shareholders, and all stakeholders as the economy recovers. hat wraps up my opening comments. I'll come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick? Nick Gangestad : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will start on slide 10, and review the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.1 billion with adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion and adjusted operating margins of 20.8%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Solid underlying productivity in the quarter along with benefits from our Q2, 2019 restructuring actions contributed 40 basis points to the margins. This result includes COVID-19-related asset write-downs, which negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points. Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 90 basis points. This impact is primarily due to the integration and amortization costs associated with our acquisition of Acelity. Higher selling prices along with lower raw material costs together, contributed 40 basis points to first quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 11 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $2.16 per share down 3% year-over-year. Looking at the components of our year-on-year earnings performance, solid productivity and benefits from Q2 2019 restructuring actions increased first quarter per share earnings by $0.07. This includes a negative $0.04 impact from the asset write-downs related to COVID-19 mentioned on the prior slide. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced first quarter earnings by $0.05 per share versus last year, primarily due to the Acelity acquisition. Please note that this result includes financing costs associated with the acquisition. Foreign currency net of hedging was an $0.08 per share headwind in the quarter. Turning to tax rate, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.6% versus 19.5% last year, lowering earnings per share by $0.03. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% versus Q1 last year adding $0.03 to per share earnings. Please turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our balance sheet and liquidity. One of the hallmarks of 3M is our strong balance sheet along with our time-tested business model which generates strong cash flow through economic cycles. As Mike mentioned we have taken proactive steps during the first quarter to protect and enhance the company's financial flexibility in this uncertain time. With respect to our balance sheet, we had cash and marketable securities on hand of $4.5 billion as of the end of March. This includes $1.75 billion in additional liquidity from last month's debt issuance. We are well capitalized to meet our two upcoming debt maturities, totaling $1.2 billion this year, one in May and another in August. Additionally, we have multiple sources of liquidity. First and foremost a business that generates strong free cash flow. In the first quarter, we had adjusted free cash flow of approximately $900 million with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 74%. Also we continue to expect the drug delivery divestiture to close in the second quarter, providing approximately $400 million in after-tax proceeds. From a capital allocation perspective, our long-term strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in our business; and second, maintaining our dividend; and lastly, flexible deployment for M&A and share repurchases. While we continue to invest in the business in the near term, we are taking actions and adjusting our 2020 capital allocation plans. As a result, we are lowering our full year CapEx budget to approximately $1.3 billion from a range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion previously. This expectation includes investing an additional $100 million to continue to expand our output of respirators. In addition, in March we suspended our share repurchase program. And finally, we are aggressively managing discretionary spending to preserve financial flexibility. That wraps up my prepared remarks. Please turn to Slide 13 and I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Nick. I'll start by providing an update on the market trends we're seeing so far in April. On a geographic basis, we're seeing ongoing improvements in Asia Pacific, most notably in China where the virus first emerged. However, we continue to experience significant downturns in the U. S., Europe and Latin America, areas that remain in the throes of the crisis. I can share that we are seeing a slowdown in growth during the first several weeks of Q2, with total company organic growth through late April down in the mid-teens. We anticipate continued strong demand for respirators, which we expect to contribute approximately 150 basis points to company-wide Q2 growth. At the same time, we expect ongoing weakness in other end markets through Q2, including oral care, automotive, office supplies and general industrial. Due to this end market uncertainty, at this time, we are unable to adequately quantify the impacts to our business for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are temporarily withdrawing our 2020 guidance, until we have better visibility of the duration and impact of the slowdown. At this time, we believe Q2 results will be especially challenged, given the trends we have seen so far in April, with revenue and EPS declines year-over-year. In lieu of guidance, starting in May, we will provide monthly updates on how our business is performing and we will continue to provide this until we are better able to forecast future performance. Please turn to slide 14. To wrap up, our strong fundamentals and position with customers across industries provides a firm foundation during this time of uncertainty. We may not know the exact shape of the recovery, but we are well prepared for a wide range of scenarios and are taking actions to prepare us to lead out of this slowdown. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to once again thank all 3Mers for your tremendous work and for everything you're doing in this unprecedented moment. I'm very proud to represent 3M and our people around the world. Going forward, we'll continue to do all we can to protect our employees, protect our enterprise and help the world get through this crisis. That concludes our remarks and we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Mike Roman : Hey, Andrew. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : It's great to see 3M finally doing what 3M always does. Congratulations. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Andrew Obin : Just first question, just a big picture question. In terms of your capacity additions in nonwovens and specifically respirators, how do you think the industry will change, because you're not the only ones adding capacity? Lots of capacity added in China. All of a sudden you have Honeywell showing up in North America and Europe. What does it mean for competitive environment two years out? Mike Roman : Yes. Andrew, it's a little hard to look two years out. But, certainly, as we think about capacity expansion that we're doing today, a big part of that is in that category of surge capacity for situations like we're facing with COVID-19, there is going to be, we think, a significant tail to demand in this. You can look out. There's demand from governments from healthcare and there's also ongoing demand in the industry as industry comes back from economic slowdown. So we're mapping all of that into our capacity and then we're working with governments and the Department of Defense in the U. S. to plan for capacity that would be dedicated to their needs in a COVID-like crisis. So I think it's really lined up well with what we see as ongoing market and industry demand. And we're looking obviously broader than just our capacity. We're looking at the marketplace and the capabilities. And we're focusing here on N95 and just really respiratory solutions that meet those requirements. So I think it's got a view as far as we can see it. As we look out further beyond, you said, a couple of years out its going to depend on where we end up in those big end markets, healthcare and industrial. Andrew Obin : And just on an unrelated topic, I think, there were some news items. I think, Bloomberg reported some sort of developments in the hearing protection lawsuits. Can you just -- and it's interesting, I guess, the message is on pricing and disclosure. And, I guess, in light that you guys actually published list for N95. But can you just comment where you are in terms of this hearing protection lawsuit? And any comment sort of on the Bloomberg article? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me start here. 3M has great respect for the brave men and women who protect us around the world. And we have a long history of partnering with the U. S. military and we continue to be committed to making safe products. We've worked in close coordination with them and 3M did not withhold information from the government about fit and use of this product. The narrative out there is misleading and really lacks context. So, I think it's -- we will defend ourselves. And we deny that our product was defectively designed. So, I would just say that, that narrative is very misleading. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter.. Mike Roman : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hi, Deane. Nick Gangestad : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I'd also like to add my appreciation for all the 3M has done to help health care workers globally. And in my view that's exactly the kind of corporate citizen we'd expect 3M to respond and so, congratulations to everybody. Mike Roman : Yeah. Thanks, Deane. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Deane Dray : A number of companies have in lieu of -- considering suspending guidance they've been offering some scenario analysis or sensitivity in terms of how the year could play out, in terms of decrementals, margins. Can you take a stab at that? And how might this all compare to the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, if we use that as kind of a benchmark? Could we start there please? Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Deane I'll take that one. First of all, of course we like I think any other company we're going through a number of scenarios. And while I don't plan to share the different scenarios because this is a dynamic situation, a couple of things I will share. First of all, we -- as Mike noted, as we go through this quarter. And until we see a reason to change that we're going to be providing monthly revenue to give you the insight of what's going on with our businesses in different geographies. In addition, you heard Mike talk about the cost-saving actions that we are -- that we've implemented for Q2. And inclusive of that, we expect in the second quarter that we will be seeing decremental margins between 30% and 40%. And now that's inclusive of the $350 million to $400 million of cost saving actions. So, between sharing the revenue, each month as we see it and this -- and our view on, decremental margins, we think that gives you some insight, as to what you can be expecting from us from an earnings perspective, as we're going forward. Deane Dray : That's a helpful start. And then, could you also clarify since this is -- and we appreciate getting the monthly revenue updates. You just suggested we could be getting it by geography. Will you also be sharing -- will it be organic and also by segment? Nick Gangestad : We think organic is the best way to share this. And that's our plan right now. And we do plan to be providing insights of what's going on by both, business and geography. Deane Dray : Okay. That's going to be really helpful, so I appreciate it. Just last question, it got cited but not clarified. What were the asset write-downs that were COVID-related? You sized it. But what were the businesses and why? Nick Gangestad : Those are -- within our company we have -- what we call new ventures, where we're investing venture capital in a number of places of emerging technologies that we think will complement the 3M business model. These were some mark-to-market actions. All or virtually all were felt within the [core] [ph] miscellaneous aspect of our company. Deane Dray : But why were those COVID-related? Nick Gangestad : As a result of changes in triggering events, in terms of the value of those companies that, we saw that as COVID-related. Deane Dray : Okay. Thank you. Good luck to everyone. Stay healthy. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Steve. Nick Gangestad : Hi Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey, sorry if I missed this busy earnings morning. But the $350 million to $450 million in costs in the second quarter that's a pretty big number. Does that -- is there kind of carry forward into the \u2013 sorry, in the second quarter. Does that carry forward in like the third and the fourth? And how much of that is temporary? How much of that was from last year's restructuring? Just unclear to me what's included there? Sorry if I missed you detailing it earlier in the call. I'm sure you did. But I missed -- I might have missed that. Thanks. Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Steve, I'll go through a few of those details. First of all, it is taking actions on a number of components of cost structure. The first and the biggest component is things what we internal to 3M called indirect costs, things that are not payroll or raw material cost related. So, travel, external services, temporary workers, targeted ad merch, things like that we are working on bringing that spending down, in line with what we're seeing happen in the external market. We've also frozen any new hiring. And in the case of with employees there are some parts of the world where we have put employees on required mandatory use of vacation. So, those are the things that are driving that. In terms of carry forward into future quarters, I'd say Steve it's just volatile now that -- and flexible that some of it, or much of it may carry forward depending on what we see, but not necessarily depending on the type of recovery that 3M sees in the coming quarters. Steve Tusa : Okay. So you seem to, kind of, have yet to take structural action -- incremental structural action beyond what you guys did last year, which is what most companies are doing just by the way. Nick Gangestad : That is correct Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last one just on how you're approaching this environment. The inventories, a lot of companies are keeping a little bit of a buffer stock. Have you guys maintained that buffer stock, or have you continued to work down inventories from where they were last year? Mike Roman : Yeah, Steve one of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks was how our enterprise operations bringing together manufacturing supply chain and customer operations together into one organization that we launched at the beginning of the year. It's really been benefiting us and this is another area where really we continue to take down days of inventory outstanding. So we do have plans to reduce inventory, some of it in response to slower demand, some of it really taking advantage of that improved performance. So we have targeted significant inventory reductions on both of those drivers. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate all the details. Mike Roman : Thanks, Steve. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : By the way great idea. Good morning. Great idea on the multi sales and please continue that post COVID. It's one of the information I have. I'm sure you want to. So looking at the April trends, and obviously a lot of companies are using April to anchor their expectations for 2Q and beyond and then using China as a sort of the lead indicator for what to expect elsewhere. So just two-part question here; one, would be can we use the mid-teens kind of placeholder for April as a guide particularly, or are you seeing sequential deterioration through April, which indicates that might get a little bit worse or get better? And then in China the strength that we've seen in April, which is obviously very encouraging. But how much of that is a sort of restock versus the obviously the severe declines we saw in February? Mike Roman : Yeah. Nigel, maybe I'll take that. When you look at April, it's what it is. Our April trends to date. I led with outlook description, very fast changing lot of uncertainty. So to look beyond that trend part of the reason we're going to give monthly updates is it's just -- you can't project April into May or June or any further than what we are seeing right now. And I would -- so we'll update you as we go on that and give you better clarity month-by-month. When you look at China, we are seeing improvements. We're returning to growth in China. It's pretty broad-based across our portfolio. And for sure there's going to be some restocking. But we're seeing the economy start to show signs of recovery broadly. And it's not back to normal yet, but improving as we move through April. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. And then I think one for Nick. On the pricing 40 basis points in the quarter, are we confident that pricing will remain positive this year? Are we seeing any warning signs outside of Asia on pricing? And then can you just mark-to-market on where the raw material benefit is right now for FY 2020? Nick Gangestad : Yeah, Nigel we started the year saying our price growth that we thought would be consistent with past trends and the 40 basis points that we saw in the first quarter is very much in line. If we look forward for the balance of this year, we're not seeing any kind of material change in what we're expecting for price growth for us. We think it will stay in this zone. In regards to raw materials Nigel we -- at the beginning of the year, we said that we expected raw materials to be between flat to up to a $0.10 tailwind to us. Right now if we look at it, it's going to be better than that. It's going to be a more significant tailwind. I'm not going to quantify it because things are dynamic enough, but we're seeing it go beyond that for benefit right now. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks very much. Nick Gangestad : Yeah. Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe\u2026 Mike Roman : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just a first question please around the Health Care division. Maybe just help us understand within that what you've seen so far as the puts and takes from COVID? And it looks like underlying margins, excluding the acquisition impacts have been flattish in Q1 and Q4. So just wondering if and when health care sales recover alongside say oral care coming back, should we expect good incremental margins, or is it just that Health Care is at a higher level of reinvestment for the near or medium-term? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yeah, Julian maybe I'll comment just on the business trends that we're seeing. So we saw Health Care grow by a little over 1% in first quarter. It was led by medical solutions and food safety. As we got to March, we saw a significant slowdown in oral care. And we also saw an impact from elective surgeries and a slowdown in Health Care in some of our medical solutions areas as well. So those are some of the trends we're seeing behind that overall growth number. Maybe I'll ask Nick to comment on the margin and your question around margins. Nick Gangestad : Yes. Julian, of course, the biggest thing that we're seeing from margins in Health Care right now is from our acquisition of Acelity. And I think you will note in the appendix we're now providing EBITDA margins. We felt that would be helpful given the acquisition of Acelity to give one more level of information on that. In terms of the margins that we're seeing, it was absent Acelity pretty close to flat. And we've seen some mix impact in the first quarter as we've seen some parts of that business more impacted by COVID. And as Mike said, as we go into second quarter we will continue to see impacts on elective procedures that will be having an impact both on our growth and on our margin. As those recover and as we see people going back to their oral care professionals and electing to do elective procedures, we've also seen that have a positive impact on our margin going forward. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my second question around the Safety and Industrial business. Clearly, some good tailwinds from all the work being done around respirators, but maybe focusing on the margin side very good margin uplift in the first quarter. Do you think we're now at a level in that business where given the cost-cutting actions some of the reorganization measures at 3M once we see the sales side improve in the second half or next year in industrial within that division we should see very good operating leverage there as well as good sales growth? Nick Gangestad : Hey, Julian, I'll take that one. So we have been doing a number of actions within our Safety and Industrial business to be enhancing the margins. The things that we've been doing to make that a more efficient productive operation and part of what we were announcing on our January earnings call. When we look at what -- in our margins in particular in the first quarter that's been impacting that. But I think even more importantly we've had really good spending control going on in our Safety and Industrial business and that's been one of the big drivers of what you see in our first quarter margin. So yes going forward if there's -- as when we return to growth we will be seeing some benefits. But we also are seeing an impact right now of really good disciplined spending control in that business. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please proceed. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Nick Gangestad : Hey, Jeff. Mike Roman : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. And just a little more granularity on some of the divisional stuff if I could. Excuse me. Personal safety was up looks like 7% in the quarter $60 million or so. I guess, I would have expected maybe it to be even stronger than that. I guess the 1.5% benefit you're talking about for Q2 I think is relative to total company sales. So it looks like you're looking for another kind of $120 million or so, kind of, lift on a year-over-year basis. Is that correct? And would that be kind of indicative of what your kind of current run rate production is for that business? Bruce Jermeland : Hey, Jeff. This is Bruce. Organically, personal safety is up 14%. What you're seeing for all-in sales growth we had divestiture impact from our gas and flame detection divestiture which is impacting obviously total sales growth. Jeff Sprague : All right. That's helpful. Thanks, Bruce. And then Nick just thinking about the sources and uses of cash and thanks for your color there what is your view on repo? Should we consider it's off the table for the balance of the year? Is this something that you'll be reconsidering as the year progresses? And is there going to be any requirement in pension as you get towards the end of this year looking into next? Nick Gangestad : Yes. Jeff, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at a number of scenarios and manage accordingly for those. I think it would be fair to say that it's a dynamic situation. So I'm not going to put a timeline of when we would be possibly back in the market with a the share buyback program, but I think it's safe to say that we would want to have enough confidence in the future that we can resume guidance of what we're anticipating for our financial results before we would be resuming our share buyback program. In regards to the pension, we started the year with a well-funded pension. And we took what I will call a minor hit in our pension-funded status in the first quarter. And right now we don't foresee any changes in our capital allocation plans to our pension. We've been targeting around $200 million a year to our global defined benefit pension plans. And we don't see any required -- changes required in that pension funding going forward. So we don't -- for the foreseeable future at this point we're not seeing that change Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope, you're all well. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Just maybe touching on China to start-off. It looks like the rebound in April has been pretty strong. Is there any end market-specific commentary that you can provide on what's really driving the strength in April? Mike Roman : Yes. Joe, it -- when I said it was broad-based, we're seeing it across our businesses. Maybe I'd highlight, automotive is recovering. And remember, we had a big decline in Q1. So it's coming off of a low point, but starting to see some recovery there. Electronics has been leading the way. Semiconductor manufacturing has been strong demand for us. Consumer electronics off, but not as much. We're seeing Health Care and oral care recovering as we come into April. And then broader industrial and consumer as well. So it's really broad-based the market all the markets and businesses for us. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And Mike, I may have missed this earlier, but as you're kind of thinking about the guidance and clearly, we don't have one now for the rest of the year. But like as you're kind of thinking about the trajectory for the U.S. and Europe, how much are you using China as like a guidepost from a growth perspective for the rest of the company? Mike Roman : Yes. I would say, back to this fast-changing and lots of uncertainty, I think it's encouraging what we're seeing in China. But it's as good as April to date for us, because it's a pretty fast-changing dynamic globally. We did see as I mentioned trends in the second half of March in the Americas and EMEA down. And in some of the businesses that we highlighted that were weaker oral care elective procedures in our medical solutions, automotive general industrial, those are trends that we saw coming into the quarter. We'll have to see how it plays out and get a little further before we can give you a better projection. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Good enough. Thanks guys. Mike Roman : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Good morning guys. Mike Roman : Hey, Scott. Nick Gangestad : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Just comment here just says late April 75% plants and distribution centers fully or partially operational. What -- is there a sense -- how do you compare that to past cycles? Is that -- given that you'd probably be shutting some stuff down or shifts declined and stuff like that, is that materially different than what you saw in late 2008? Is it something you expect to ramp up meaningfully over the summer? Just a bit more color on that please. Mike Roman : Scott, I think the way to think about it is look at our sales value of production. And we -- as I talked about some of the benefits of our enterprise operations the way we're operating that we're able to adjust more quickly and track with our demand and make sure our production plans are tracking with it. I remember, Q1 last year was one of the things we're working on adjusting to a slowdown in end markets. We are shortening our cycle times to do that. So our SVOP is tracking with what you saw in Q1. It's tracking with what we're seeing April year-to-date. That 75% number is kind of a view over a broader portfolio against end demand and just how we're managing the factories in the middle of the COVID crisis. So I think looking at SVOP is the way to look at it. And we can adapt quickly and we'll adjust as we see changes in the marketplace. Scott Davis : Okay. Good, Mike. But can you help us understand, how that might compare to past recessions if you -- it doesn't have to be explicit, but if you have a sense of where you were in late 2008 was this 80%, 85%, or is this... Mike Roman : I think the way I would probably think about it Scott is, I'd look at the magnitude of the slowdown and it's probably similar. There might be a little faster reaction to it and adoption to it now than even then. But we -- and living in 2009, we really managed our operations very quickly to in line with what we're seeing in the slowdown. And then back up again as the markets recovered even in the second half of the year. So I think it's similar, and it's one of the strengths of our model being vertically integrated with our manufacturing that we can do this. So I do give our teams credit for reducing cycle times, but the strategy and the 3M model, the strength is there in 2009 and it's here again in 2020. Scott Davis : Okay. Super helpful. Thanks. Good luck guys and stay safe and we appreciate the monthly data too. So thank you. Nick Gangestad : Thank you. Mike Roman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Hope, you're well. Mike Roman : Hey, Andy. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So you mentioned \u2013 Mike, you mentioned the impact from respirators in the business. Just following up Jeff -- on Jeff's question a little bit 150 basis points. But given you're ramping to 2 billion respirators a year would seem like your impact could be more than 150 basis points by the end of the year, especially for the total PPE business. You do make surgical masks, gowns. You've got safety now. So could you give us some more color on the sizing of overall PPE? Any more color there would be helpful. Mike Roman : Well I think the 150 basis points is -- that's Q2. That's the way we look at it in Q2. And we are adding capacity in the U.S. coming out of Q2. In late June, we'll get to 50 million respirators a month. That's up 40% from where we've been running coming into the quarter and where we expect to run for much of the quarter. And then our increased capacity that we plan to bring on later in the year and that likely to be a Q4 impact kind of on the business results. It will give us additional supply into very strong demand. So, we'll see additional growth impact from that. I don't have a number for you at this time. It's not clear the demand and how exactly the timing of when that production comes on, but you can use that 35 million to 50 million in the U.S. which the 35 million was part of 100 million worldwide. So, you can kind of back into maybe a 15% increase on the worldwide N95 piece of that come out of Q2. Bruce Jermeland : And Andy for reference our disposable respirator business which is largely the N95, pre-crisis was about 2% of our global revenue, slightly less than that or around $600 million. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. That's helpful guys. And then Mike I wanted to follow-up on the comments on electronics. I mean you mentioned the recovery in China. It's obviously more of a China-based business for you guys, but is that business being a little more resilient this cycle than expected? Can you give us some more color on what your -- to the extent you can on expectations moving forward between semicon? Obviously, you've got mobile devices in there. What are you seeing in that business? Mike Roman : Yes. And Andy even as we came into the year, we were starting to feel better about electronics and it was really semiconductor manufacturing demand increasing. And that has held up. We're seeing that and that's part of that broader growth and return to growth in China. Consumer Electronics has been year-over-year a bit of a slowdown. We continue to see that. But overall, electronics is seeing a positive uptick as we come into Q2. Andy Kaplowitz : So just pushing you a little bit, is it up year-over-year at this point in April? Mike Roman : April year-to-date -- or April month-to-date yes. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. Thanks guys. Nick Gangestad : Andy, I want to just give a little -- just go at one level down that where we are seeing our most significant growth in electronics in China is around fluids and semiconductor and less so on the consumer electronics side. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. Thanks Nick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Bruce Jermeland : Good morning, Nicole. Mike Roman : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So, just following up on some of the questions around cost-cutting activities that you guys are doing this year, does that -- the 30% to 40% decremental margin assumption, I assume that also includes the carryover from payback on last year's restructuring actions. Is that correct? Nick Gangestad : When we say the $30 million to $40 million, that's also including the year-on-year impact of taking those actions last year, so that's -- that is part of us being able to deliver a 30% to 40% decremental in the second quarter. Yes, that's part of it. On -- plus the extra $350 million to $400 million of cost savings we're initiating in this quarter. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. Thanks Nick. And as my follow-up, if we think about the Health Care business, is there a way to quantify how much of the Health Care business is actually being impacted by elective surgeries not taking place? I'm just trying to get a sense of what part of the business has the potential to come back as COVID cases die down and elective surgeries return? Mike Roman : Well medical solutions Nicole is our largest business in Health Care and that's being impacted by elective procedures. We're also seeing that in our Acelity business which is part of medical solutions. Oral care has been the more sharply impacted in demand slowdown as we come out of March. So, that's our second largest business in Health Care. So it's the bigger part of the impact I would say as we come into the quarter. But we would expect as elective procedures come back and demand there increases we'll see the benefit of that in that medical solutions business. And I -- so I think it's both is the answer and it's -- we expect it to recover as elective procedures come back. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks. I'll pass it on. Nick Gangestad : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Kind of a specific question here, but just want to understand the geography of where something might live looking at slide 22 when you talk about the sales by divisions. But it was interesting. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about respirator demand government industry health care I didn't hear consumer. Just wondering if we actually start to see some different behavior from consumers. Where that would show up? Does that actually hit the consumer segment through some type of health care, or would that go through a different segment and then ultimately end up in a consumer's home? Mike Roman : Yes. And John, thank you for catching me on that because consumer is an important part of where we do supply respirator solutions. It reaches a broad range of customers. Some of them in -- through our DIY channel and small construction companies are strong customers for that. But we do expect to see a demand from consumers as we move forward as well. And that will show up in the results of our consumer business. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. John, the biggest impact we're seeing is in our stationery and office business. Currently, as people have gone or work remotely from home on the negative side along with obviously schools shutting down. John Walsh : Yes. No, thank you. That's helpful. And then there's kind of a lot of excitement that we might see some manufacturing return to the U.S. Obviously you highlighted on PP&E. There's been some discussion around life sciences. Just curious, what you're hearing or seeing from some of your folks that are doing pharma filtration. I'm thinking about, if they're actually starting to get quotes or see an uptick activity for some of those solutions that you sell to that manufacturing front? Mike Roman : Yes. And John, maybe I'll start there. We have seen some increased demand in our biopharma filtration. I highlighted as one of the stronger demand, stronger growth in Q1 and even as we come into April. When talking about manufacturing and having supply in the U.S., we are a company that as we took our model overseas, we never left the U.S. We continue to manufacture in the U.S. for the demand we have in this marketplace and then some. We have -- we take advantage of our strong base here and our technology in the U.S. and we do export as well. So our strategy -- and it's true around the world but especially true in the U.S., our strategy is to locate our manufacturing and supply chains close to customers to be able to serve them regionally and that's true of respirators and it's true of health care products and it's true of biopharma. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for the color. Mike Roman : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To close, I am incredibly proud of how our people are helping lead the response to COVID-19 and managing through this uncertain time. Going forward, we will continue to be guided by the three principles I laid out at the beginning of my remarks, protecting our employees; fighting the pandemic from all angles; and maintaining business continuity while positioning 3M to lead out of the slowdown and deliver for our employees' customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time if you have a question, please press the one followed by the four on your telephone keypad. It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you are going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 28, 2020.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, along with Nick Gangestad and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officers. As you may know, Nick will be retiring at the end of July. Monish joined the 3M team on July 1, succeeding Nick as CFO. Mike, Nick and Monish will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions.  Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Let me remind you to mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call, which will take place on Tuesday, October 27.  Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we\u2019ll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today\u2019s presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. Please note we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today\u2019s press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you Bruce. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy, and I thank you for joining us. We continue to fight the pandemic from all angles to ensure the safety of our employees, healthcare workers, first responders, and the public. In a highly uncertain environment where economic activity was restricted by global lockdowns, we executed well and delivered another strong operational performance in the second quarter. We posted solid margins and robust cash flow while strengthening our balance sheet, innovating for our customers, investing in the future, and continuing our transformation. Our value model is strong and we are taking action on a number of fronts to lead through this crisis and emerge even stronger. While there remains a great deal of economic uncertainty, we are seeing an improvement in sales trends in July across all businesses and geographies as we start the third quarter, and Monish will provide additional comments later in the call. I am proud of how our team is leading through these unprecedented times and I thank all 3Mers for their tireless efforts to serve those who count on us. Please turn to Slide 5. Our COVID-19 response starts with a steadfast commitment to the health of our employees. We have robust safety protocols in our manufacturing plants and distribution sites, enabling us to effectively protect our people while maintaining supply chain operations. For remote employees, we have developed a phased approach for their return to the workplace with enhanced safety measures and emphasis on flexibility for individuals. We have had our colleagues return to the workplace in two dozen countries, mainly in Asia and EMEA, along with our global R&D community, and we are adjusting based on government guidelines and the evolution of the pandemic across the world.  As we protect employees, we work around the clock to protect the safety of all people, including healthcare workers and first responders. 3M is making and distributing more respirators than ever before, though demand continues to far outpace what the entire industry can supply. In the first half of the year, 3M manufactured 800 million respirators globally with half distributed in the U.S., primarily to healthcare and FEMA. For the full year, we expect to produce 2 billion respirators globally, more a threefold increase versus 2019.  We continue to make investments and partner with the U.S. Department of Defense and other governments to bring additional global capacity online. We are also working with federal, state and local governments to deliver respirators where the need is greatest. At the same time, we remain vigilant in fighting fraud and price gouging. To date, 3M has filed 18 lawsuits and removed over 7,000 counterfeit websites, protecting people from bad actors.  Beyond personal protective equipment, 3M science is fighting COVID-19 in other areas as well. Our membrane technologies help improve blood oxygenation procedures and our biopharma solutions support the development of needed vaccines and therapeutics. Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with MIT on a diagnostic COVID-19 test that aspires to make testing faster, more broadly available, and less expensive. The project has received approval from the National Institutes of Health and we are working as fast as we can to develop a low cost, highly accurate device that can be mass produced. I will now turn to our second quarter results on Slide 6. The financial impact of the pandemic remained mixed across 3M during Q2. We continue to see strong demand in personal safety along with other areas, such as home improvement, general cleaning, and biopharma filtration. At the same time, we experienced steep but expected declines in other end markets, including medical and dental elective procedures, automotive OEM and aftermarket, and general industrial.  Geographically, while organic sales in Asia Pacific declined 8%, we saw year-over-year improvement in China, up 3% in the quarter versus down 11% in Q1. Organic trends in EMEA and the Americas remained consistent throughout the quarter, both declining in the mid-teens each month. All in, organic sales company-wide was minus 13% with adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share. While growth conditions were challenging, our operational execution was strong. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to 26.5%, up 110 basis points year-on-year. In the second quarter, we delivered $400 million in cost savings versus last year as we aggressively managed expenses to offset COVID-19 impacts and associated restructuring. This cost discipline along with effective capital allocation enabled us to increase our adjusted free cash flow to $1.5 billion in the second quarter, and Nick will walk you through the details. Please turn to Slide 7. Importantly, while we managed near term uncertainty, we continued to advance our four strategic priorities : portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. We finalized the sale of our drug delivery business in May, enabling us to focus more on our core healthcare portfolio. We are encouraged at the benefits we are seeing from the new global operating model we implemented this year, a significant step in our transformation. This includes our new enterprise operations team which is enabling us to reduce cycle times and improve the customer experience. Nearly all of our plants and distribution centers are operational and we have worked with our partners to ensure consistency of supply. Our new structure streamlines decision making and allows us to adjust faster than ever to the external environment, all of which helps our customers. As just one example, one of our U.S. plants recently pivoted to manufacturing hand sanitizer almost overnight, moving from formulation to production in less than 72 hours.  In addition, we\u2019re accelerating our efforts on automation and robotics and introducing new digital capabilities such as virtual selling tools to deliver on our promises to customers. At the heart of 3M is innovation and our ability to apply science to solve critical customer needs. We continue to invest in R&D and drive innovations to solve big challenges like air quality, automotive electrification and food safety, just a few of our priority growth platforms which are outperforming in the markets they serve. For example, our air quality platform grew double digits in the quarter as we introduce new indoor air quality solutions through our innovation and increased investments in capital.  We are also finding new ways to engage our people, strengthen our culture, and advance our core values. We continue to step up our leadership in sustainability and our annual Sustainability Report released in May includes a comprehensive look at our progress. As part of this commitment, we are proactively managing PFAS guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility, and transparency. For example, in March we launched a clearinghouse to share research on testing, measurement and remediation, a commitment we made at our Congressional testimony last fall. You can find this clearinghouse and all the latest information on PFAS on our website at 3m.com. In addition, we provide regular updates in our 10-Q filings. We are also fulfilling our commitment to comprehensive reviews of all 3M manufacturing operations to ensure adherence to environmental requirements, company policies, and our values. As we shared previously, we continue to work with communities where we manufacture, along with government officials and regulators including the EPA, to advance our environmental stewardship.  Last week, we announced an agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to resolve matters related to previously disclosed PFAS discharges at our Decatur facility. This is part of our commitment to address contamination at sites where we manufactured or disposed of PFAS. With respect to PFAS litigation, we anticipate the earliest trial date will now be in 2021.  Beyond our environmental responsibility, we know we and others must do more to address injustice and inequality. The death of George Floyd here in Minnesota was jarring for all 3Mers, especially our African American employees. At 3M, we stand for equity, fairness and social justice, and we will be part of the solution by listening, understanding, and then acting. Based on insights from our employees and communities, we have two focus areas. First, we are identifying the most impactful actions to accelerate inclusion and diversity within 3M. While we have made good progress in recent years, we have much more to do. At the same time, we are working with other companies on actions that will make a difference here in Minnesota, and we have made initial investments as part of these efforts. We are also working with stakeholders to develop a long term plan to support economic opportunities and development in communities of color, address the education gap, and advance social justice. It is vital that companies step up to lead change, to really make a difference this time. I am personally leading these initiatives and we will provide you with updates as we move forward. Please turn to Slide 8. Before turning the call to Nick, I would like to make a few comments about our CFO transition. First, I want to thank Nick for his many contributions throughout 35 years at 3M. He has been an outstanding leader and a great colleague, and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. In six years as CFO, Nick\u2019s guidance has been especially valuable as he helped lead our transformation and our work to optimize our portfolio and position 3M for the future. I wish Nick and his family all the best in the future. I am also excited to welcome Monish to our leadership team. Most recently, Monish was CFO at GE Healthcare, a $17 billion business. His experience leading healthcare and industrial businesses along with driving operational transformation is already making an immediate impact for 3M. Monish is an ideal fit for our enterprise and for our culture, and later in the call he will make a few comments about our perspective on the third quarter. I will now turn the call over to Nick for the details on Q2. Nick? Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.2 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margins of 19.6%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the second quarter. The impact of the pandemic was varied and numerous across the business and operations. The biggest factor negatively affecting Q2 operating margins was the impact of the pandemic on global customer demand, which resulted in nearly a 14% year-on-year decline in organic sales volumes.  In addition, during the quarter we undertook restructuring actions resulting in a Q2 charge of $58 million due to the impact of the pandemic. These headwinds were partially offset by aggressive cost management during the quarter which reduced costs by approximately $400 million year-on-year. Also providing a year-on-year benefit to operating margins is a restructuring charge in last year\u2019s second quarter. All in, these benefits were more than offset by the decline in organic sales volume and restructuring actions resulting in a 100 basis point reduction to second quarter margins versus last year. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced margins by 80 basis points due to Acelity purchase accounting impacts. Higher selling prices along with lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to second quarter margins. Finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 10 basis points. Overall, we effectively managed costs throughout the quarter in a very dynamic and challenging global economy, and as Mike mentioned, we expanded EBITDA margins by 110 basis points year-on-year to 26.5%. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $1.78 per share, down 16.4% year-over-year. Let me now cover the items that made up our second quarter earnings performance. Similar to the operating margin discussion on the prior slide, organic sales declines, productivity, and other actions collectively reduced year-on-year per share earnings by $0.28. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced second quarter earnings by $0.07 per share versus last year primarily due to the Acelity acquisition. Please note that this result includes financing costs associated with the acquisition. Foreign currency net of hedging was a $0.05 per share headwind in the quarter. Turning to tax rate, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.7% versus 22.3% last year, adding $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% versus Q2 last year, adding $0.02 to per-share earnings. Please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. As Mike noted, we delivered strong second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year. This increase was driven by effective working capital management, disciplined capital allocation, along with a $400 million benefit related to timing of income tax payments which will be paid in the third quarter. Through the first half of the year, adjusted free cash flow increased to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion last year as we continue to generate strong free cash flow, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model. From a capital allocation perspective, our long term strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in our business; second, maintaining our dividend; and lastly, flexible deployment for M&A and share repurchases. Second quarter capital expenditures were $379 million. For the full year, we now anticipate capex expenses of approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion previously. This increase in our full year capex budget expectations is primarily due to the pace of projects picking back up as economic activity returns. During the second quarter, we returned $846 million to our shareholders via dividends. Share repurchases remained suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong second quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.7 billion or 10% in the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which declined 6% organically in the quarter. Personal safety saw strong double digit organic growth driven by continued unprecedented levels of demand for respirators globally in response to the pandemic. The balance of the safety and industrial portfolio declined significantly due to the global slowdown in industrial production activity during the quarter.  Looking geographically, the Americas declined 9% organically with the U.S. down mid single digits. EMEA declined 1% while Asia Pacific was down 4%. Safety and industrial\u2019s second quarter segment operating margins were 23.8%, up 180 basis points driven by continued strong productivity, cost actions, and benefits from last year\u2019s restructuring. Moving to transportation and electronics, second quarter sales were down 19% organically compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was down 1% with strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation, and data center, which was offset by continued softness in consumer electronics, particularly smartphones. Our automotive OEM business was down 44% year-on-year, in line with the 45% decline in global car and light truck builds. Commercial solutions declined roughly 30% while transportation safety and advanced materials were down mid and high teens respectively. Geographically, Asia Pacific declined 8% while the Americas declined 29% and EMEA was down 33%.  Transportation and electronics second quarter operating margins were 19.7%, negatively impacted by the 19% decline in organic sales which was partially offset by cost actions and benefits from last year\u2019s restructuring. Turning to healthcare, which experienced significant pandemic-related challenges and disruptions across the industry, declined 12% organically versus last year. Organic growth across much of our healthcare portfolio was negatively impacted by the effects of COVID, which resulted in delays in elective medical procedures and closed most dental offices around the world. These impacts were most prevalent in our oral care business, which was down nearly 60%, and medical solutions which declined mid single digits in Q2.  Food safety declined mid single digits as the business was impacted by the closure of food processing plants during the quarter due to worker safety concerns. A positive note, our separation and purification business grew mid single digits. This business continues to experience strong demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Looking geographically, the Americas declined 14% while EMEA and Asia Pacific each declined 10%. Healthcare second quarter operating margins were 16.8% or down nearly 10 percentage points year-on-year. Approximately two thirds of this decline was due to the significant reduction in organic sales with the remaining one third related to the Acelity acquisition. Looking ahead, we expect both organic growth and operating margins to improve as elective procedures return. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our consumer business was down 5%. Organic sales growth within consumer was led by our homecare business up high single digits, along with home improvement which was up low single digits. Growth in these businesses was driven by strong customer demand for our Scotchbrite cleaning products and solutions, Scotch Blue painters tape, Filtrete air filtration products, and Meguiar\u2019s car care products. Stationary and office and consumer healthcare both declined, impacted by the stay-at-home orders and social distancing protocols which resulted in many offices and schools being closed across the world.  Looking at consumer geographically, the Americas and Asia Pacific were each down mid single digits while EMEA declined 10%. Consumer\u2019s operating margins were 23.2%, up 250 basis points on strong cost discipline and ongoing productivity.  That wraps up my review of the second quarter results. Before I turn it over to Monish, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to make a few comments given it is my last earnings call. Thirty five years ago, I started my career at 3M right out of college. I\u2019m humbled and grateful for the many opportunities and experiences I have had throughout my career, and most importantly the many wonderful people that I have gotten to know both professionally and personally around the world.  In the last six years, I\u2019ve been blessed to be the CFO of this great company and to lead 3M\u2019s global finance organization. As part of my role as CFO, I have also had the opportunity to engage with many of you in the investor community. I have greatly enjoyed the many interactions with those of you who have covered and invested in 3M. I have appreciated your support, input and feedback, and I wish you all the best in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 13 and I will hand it over to Monish to discuss our thoughts going forward. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. First, I would like to recognize and thank Nick not only for his 35 years of outstanding service to 3M, but also for his partnership, counsel and guidance over the past month in helping me learn 3M and ensure a smooth transition. Like Nick, I am humbled to be a part of this outstanding company. I have had great admiration of 3M and its vast scientific capabilities to positively impact the world, including and across industry, healthcare and consumers\u2019 lives. It\u2019s great to be a part of the leadership team and to lead the company\u2019s global finance organization. Over the past month, I have spent time meeting with leadership, key finance members, and also participating in strategic and operating reviews and discussions. While I have only been on the job for a few weeks, this past month has given me a great opportunity to personally engage with our leadership team and learn the company. I want to thank all 3Mers for their warm welcome. With that, let me make a few remarks regarding our thoughts on the coming quarter.  As we start the third quarter, we are seeing sequential improvements in end markets, including automotive, healthcare, and general industrial. While the strength and pace of recovery remains uncertain, we currently are expecting global economic activity to be stronger in Q3 as compared to Q2.  Turning to our business, we are seeing a broad-based pick-up in growth across our businesses and geographies as we start the third quarter. With one week left in July, total company sales are currently up low single digits year-on-year. With respect to respirators, we anticipate continued strong demand which we estimate will contribute approximately 300 to 350 basis points to company-wide Q3 organic growth. As we did throughout Q2, we will continue to provide monthly sales information, therefore we will provide an update on July sales once we have finalized results in a few weeks.  From an operational standpoint, though we anticipate some pick-up in costs as sales growth improves, we are maintaining our aggressive cost discipline while also continuing to invest in future growth and productivity, therefore looking at margins, we currently anticipate our third quarter adjusted operating income margins in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally with respect to free cash flow, we will continue our efforts to drive improvements in working capital and prioritize capex spend. Our ongoing focus on cash flow along with disciplined capital allocation are central to enhancing our financial flexibility and strengthening our capital structure.  While uncertainty remains, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on our priorities, respond to changes in the marketplace, and invest in future growth and productivity.  With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Good morning guys. Michael Roman : Morning Scott. Scott Davis : Congrats Nick on your retirement. Hope you enjoy, well done. Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you. Scott Davis : And Monish, good luck to you. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Scott Davis : Anyways, two questions here. One, on the cost out, how much of the $400 million would you guys say is permanent, you can hold onto, versus the more temporary action? Nicholas Gangestad : Scott, I\u2019d say the majority of the $400 million is temporary, that much of what we were doing in second quarter was reducing expenses through disciplined holding down of expenses. There were some other things that we did of restructuring actions that we think will--that we know will benefit us going forward, but the majority of this $400 million we see as temporary spending reductions and not permanent spending reductions. Scott Davis : Okay. Then as a follow-up, the July--I mean, I know we\u2019re only--we\u2019re not totally through the yet, close, but that seems pretty positive based on the sequential--I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have expected positive until later in the year. Can you give us a little bit of color on that? Is there any particular snapback or inventory rebuild or discretionary healthcare has started up again, things like that, that perhaps is driving that growth? Michael Roman : Yes Scott, maybe I\u2019ll characterize it a little, really in line with what Monish said in his remarks. It\u2019s pretty broad right across businesses and geographies. We are seeing some positive growth in China coming out of Q2, and that continues, but it\u2019s really broad-based. It is related to some of the things you highlighted - elective procedures coming back, the automotive build rate sequentially getting better, still negative but getting better, so we\u2019re seeing--I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing the signs of a snapback in the inventory in the channel yet, but we\u2019re certainly early days benefiting that broader improvement across businesses and geographies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning, and I\u2019ll echo the thanks to Nick and welcome to Monish.  Maybe just a question on the adjusted operating margin first of all. I saw the guidance of 20% to 21% for Q3. It is up slightly sequentially, but I guess year-on-year it\u2019s still a very heavy decline, maybe heavier even than what you had seen in Q2, even with a better revenue trajectory. I just wanted to try and understand if that\u2019s right, if it\u2019s maybe a three-point decline in the adjusted margin year-on-year, and maybe what\u2019s driving that to offset the better volume performance. Nicholas Gangestad : Hey Julian. Yes, with the guide that we\u2019re putting out for third quarter margin 20% to 21%, we\u2019ve been looking at it from a sequential perspective and seeing it up 50 to 100 basis points over where we finish Q2 of this year. Now, as you\u2019re doing and looking at last year, you\u2019ve got to remember last year had some one-off things benefiting it. We had a gain on a sale of a building that\u2019s included in that. We also have the impact of Acelity year-on-year with Acelity not in our third quarter results last year but they\u2019re now in there. Those are the two biggest things impacting the year-on-year number. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then maybe my second question, if we look at the healthcare business specifically, I think there was a comment around improving margins in the prepared remarks. Maybe just put a finer point on it, I suppose, in healthcare, help us understand the pace at which the elective surgery-related businesses are coming back, and did the comment mean that margins could grow even in the second half, or it\u2019s more just a much narrower decline than what you\u2019ve seen in Q2? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Julian, I wouldn\u2019t take the comments to say that we expect the margins to be up year-on-year in our healthcare business. My comments there were in regards to compared to where we saw margins in the second quarter, we anticipate those continuing to expand as we see elective procedures coming back and our own volumes going up. If I use oral care as an example, each month of the second quarter we were seeing improvement in our year-on-year growth rates in that, and we expect that to continue going forward.  We\u2019re also seeing improvements on the month in our medical solutions business, so we are seeing signs that these elective procedures are coming back and we\u2019re seeing the start of that later in the second quarter, early into the third quarter, and as that continues, we expect that to have a positive impact on the sequential operating margins for healthcare. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Just a question, as things improve for you guys, what do you need to see, what are the goalpost--oh, I apologize. Before I go onto my question, I do want to thank Nick and welcome Monish. I apologize for skipping that, Nick. Good luck and thank you, and Monish, welcome. Apologies for that. Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you. Andrew Obin : So just going back to capital allocation, what do you need to see in terms of things getting back to normal to go back to share buybacks, to go back to looking at M&A? What are the takes, what are the goal posts? Monish Patolawala : Thanks for the question. The way we look at it is we have said before, it\u2019s an extremely uncertain environment, so for us to look at what you call stability, we\u2019ll have to figure out what our end markets look like. Think about big end markets, whether that\u2019s healthcare, automotive, and personal safety, so until we see that stability, it\u2019s just going to be really hard for us, so I would call those as the goalposts.  Of course, how the coronavirus cases play out in the world will be another big factor in this and how the economies start opening up, so those are just some of the macro indicators that we\u2019ll have to look at before we feel comfortable, and that\u2019s why we are taking this day by day and we\u2019re going to continue providing you monthly guidance on our revenue, and then as that stabilizes I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to have a stronger view on capital allocation. Andrew Obin : So when you stop providing monthly guidance, I should expect buybacks? Sorry, that was a joke.  Another question, you guys have some of the strongest presence in China of anybody we cover, and we\u2019ve been reading about possible supply chain disruptions related to the Yangtze River flooding. Are you seeing any impact on your customers in China? I mean, I know where you guys are, but are you seeing any impact from flooding on your supply chain or are you making any contingency plans? Just trying to figure out how real that thing is. Thanks. Michael Roman : Yes Andrew, through the entire COVID experience, we really have validated the model that we have around the world. As you know we manufacture in China a majority of what we sell in China, so we really are closely connected with the supply chains there, and I would say at this point we don\u2019t see an impact from the flooding. We\u2019re watching it closely, we\u2019re staying connected to our customers as they see interruptions. If it worsens or their businesses are interrupted, we will certainly adjust in the supply chain, but at this point we don\u2019t see a material impact on the China results.  We\u2019re seeing fairly broad-based improvements really across electronics and industrial and transportation markets leading the way. Like the U.S., elective procedures in healthcare are a little slower to recover, but it\u2019s fairly broad-based in that growth that we saw in Q2. So not at this time, but we will stay close to it and update as we go. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Can you just discuss where you stand on some of the cost actions for second half? I know you said you got $400 million out in second quarter, but maybe just discuss what you\u2019re getting in second half and the how that temporary versus structural plays into next year, just assuming flat sales for example, even though they probably won\u2019t be flat, just what you see as temporary and structural now. Just an update there. Monish Patolawala : Sure Steve. So as Nick mentioned in his prepared remarks and the prior question, most of the actions that were taken in the second quarter were temporary in nature. We have taken some structural actions through a restructuring charge, but most of them were temporary in nature. I would say we are going to continue our strong cost discipline that we are doing, but at the same time as the economic recovery starts coming back up, we are going to see investments in both growth and productivity, as well as some of the timing items in 2Q will play back out in Q3 and Q4, so that\u2019s our current view right now.  As I said, uncertain environment, but depending on which way the world plays out, we are ready to act in both investing in growth and productivity at the same time. Steve Tusa : So I guess that sounds like for--I guess that sounds just pretty--you know, performance next year will be pretty consistent to normal incremental margins on growth, with maybe just the 2Q temporary actions as the key item to call out? Monish Patolawala : As of right now, I would say that, Steve; but again, as I said, let\u2019s see how the world plays out. We\u2019ll act both on growth and productivity as required. But for Q3, again, looking at the cost actions, just to reiterate, we are looking at as sequential revenue goes up, margin rate is going to go up to 20% to 21%, which is 50 to 150 BPs better than Q2. Steve Tusa : Right, okay. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Nick, good luck, and Monish, good luck in your new role as well. I just wanted to touch quickly on July versus June. I wasn\u2019t on for the whole prepared remarks, but what caused the big snap in--you know, it looks like mid-teens declines in June on a daily basis, and then snapping into positive growth in July. Is that positive growth, is that inclusive of acquisitions or is that purely organic? Just wondering what changed between the two months. Michael Roman : Yes, so the growth was all in sales, Nigel, so it\u2019s both acquisitions and organic. I would say that broad-based view of businesses and geographies, it\u2019s adding up everywhere a little bit. That\u2019s what\u2019s making the difference, and we\u2019re seeing demand come back. There was a lot of--I think a lot of optimism that we were seeing an economic recovery at the end of second quarter, and we saw pretty consistent organic growth across the months in the quarter. We\u2019re seeing it come through now in July, so it\u2019s just, I would say, the timing of it and that broad-based across businesses and geographies is adding up to improving trends. I\u2019m encouraged by what I see.  It\u2019s still early days in the third quarter, but we\u2019re off to a good start, and I think it\u2019s a start of a trend in those markets is the cause of it. Nigel Coe : Yes, I\u2019d be curious if there\u2019s any channel impacts that\u2019s causing that, but my follow-on question is really on healthcare margins. I think the best way to think about these is on an EBITDA basis, and we saw sequentially EBITDA margins declining from 28% down to 24.1%. Obviously volumes took a big step down in 1Q versus 2Q. Is that just purely a volume impact that we\u2019re seeing there, or were there some mix impacts that we need to figure in as well? Michael Roman : Nigel, before I give it to Nick, maybe just a comment about the channel at the end there. We did see some strong point of sale as we came through second quarter, so there was expectation that sell-in would follow. That\u2019s probably contributing some of it, but we aren\u2019t seeing a big, as I said earlier, a big snapback in the channel, but there has been stronger point of sale, so that\u2019s also contributing. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks. Nicholas Gangestad : Nigel, to your question on the EBITDA margins for healthcare, and yes, we\u2019re seeing that down, and your presumption is correct. What we are seeing there is almost all volume related when we look at it on an EBITDA basis, because then we\u2019re pulling out the impact of the Acelity purchase accounting impact. It\u2019s almost all volume related, and then again, as we see volumes coming back up, we expect that to abate and come back to more normal operating margins for our healthcare business. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Walsh, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning, and a thank you to Nick and a welcome to Monish. Nicholas Gangestad : Thank you John. John Walsh : Wanted to go back to the Q3 margin guidance. I was trying to calculate the year-on-year decline if I make adjustments for the flame detection gain last year, the property gain which you kind of sized in the prepared remarks last year, and it seems like the year-on-year delta actually gets worse in Q3 versus Q2. Wanted to know, one, if that math was right or if we missed something there. Monish Patolawala : The way to look at it, John, I think the reason we went to incremental quarter-over-quarter or sequential is because it\u2019s so hard to do the math year-on-year. There were some gains last time as well as we\u2019ve got the impact of the Acelity acquisition this year, and that\u2019s why I would just request that you focus on the sequential, and that\u2019s where we are showing margin improvement of 50 to 150 basis points as we go forward, as volume starts getting better. John Walsh : Okay, thank you for that. Then maybe just a follow-up, thinking about price raws for the back half here. Price ticked up, was just curious where you\u2019re actually seeing an acceleration in getting price, maybe by the segment units because we already have it by the geography. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, so we\u2019re at 50 basis points of price growth in the second quarter, and we don\u2019t foresee that having a material change in the second half of the year. What we\u2019ve been experiencing for price growth, both for the first and the second quarter, we think is pretty indicative of where we\u2019ll be for the total year. John, there\u2019s really not any big trend change going on there to highlight. It\u2019s been a very stable number and we think it will remain stable. John Walsh : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning everyone. I will echo all the comments - we\u2019ll miss you, Nick, and look forward to working with you, Monish. Monish Patolawala : Same here, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just my first question, maybe following up on Nigel\u2019s question on healthcare margins, if we were to take out the Acelity acquisition from 2Q, what were the core decrementals in 2Q in healthcare? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Joe, the core decrementals in healthcare once I pull out Acelity, then we\u2019re in 60% or a little higher than 60%, which is not unusual given the make-up of our cost structure in healthcare. Once I pull out Acelity, then we\u2019re in that range. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful. Nick, just following up on a comment you made earlier, so none of that is mix related, like elective procedures isn\u2019t exacerbating that decremental? It\u2019s just basically volume oriented and that\u2019s it? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, when we look at a mix impact, we have pluses and minuses. It really nets out to very little change on our overall healthcare margin. Joe Ritchie : Okay, all right. Thanks. Then maybe one follow-on question, just going back to the comments around capital deployment and when you could potentially get more aggressive with a buyback or M&A. The question I have is how are you thinking about your balance sheet and your leverage going forward? There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces clearly from a PFAS perspective, and so I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re thinking about your leverage in a different way when we start thinking about you getting a little bit more aggressive in the future. Monish Patolawala : Sure, so I will just start by saying a hallmark of 3M has been its strong capital structure, and our plan is to continue doing that. De-leveraging has been a priority for 3M and we are going to continue that journey. I think the pace of de-leveraging will depend on how economic activity recovers and also our ability to continue driving strong cash flow and control our working capital. That\u2019s what I would just say for the time being is our current view. To reiterate capital allocation, our first priority has always been to invest in the business. It\u2019s R&D organic growth, best returns right there. Dividend is our second, which has been a big hallmark of 3M, that\u2019s our second priority, and then M&A is third, and then share buybacks would be our last priority. That\u2019s the way we are looking at it right now. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thank you, good morning everyone. Nick, 35 years? You look so young! I thought maybe you started out in middle school. Best of luck to you. Nicholas Gangestad : Jeff, you\u2019re kind. Thank you. Jeff Sprague : Just two business related questions for me, if I could. First on electronics, can you just provide a little more color on what you saw there? It sounds like kind of a tale of two markets, right, consumer electronics versus the other buckets. Can you give us a little more color on what you saw in the quarter in those pieces, and what the trajectory looks like into the third quarter? Michael Roman : Yes Jeff, electronics for us was down 1%, and as you said, it was kind of a mix of different stories. There was strength in semiconductor, data centers, factory automation. Those were all up double digits for us. Those have been part of our focus on where we invest for growth in electronics. That was offset by softness in consumer electronics. The broader transportation electronics was impacted more heavily by automotive and, I would say, our commercial solutions business, but in electronics the strength was in those categories. We see those trends continuing. Semiconductor fabrication continues robust growth. Consumer electronics is still soft as we start third quarter, but the benefit of being in those higher growth segments gave us some strength in electronics in the quarter. Jeff Sprague : Secondly, unrelated, on the consumer side, obviously potentially a very peculiar back to school, or maybe we don\u2019t even have back to school this year. What is going on in retail in terms of planning for this channel fill, that sort of thing, and what are you expecting in the third quarter? Michael Roman : Well, our retail partners are planning for back to school, and as you said, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around it. It\u2019s another one of those things that\u2019s almost day by day. We are--we built a little bit of inventory even as we went through the first half and anticipation of back to school. We see that being something that is going to add to some of the growth as we move forward, but it\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around how it\u2019s going to play out. The strength in consumer for us has been around home improvement and our cleaning products. Stationary and office had been declining as schools were closed, of course. We\u2019re hoping to see an uptick in demand as schools open, but that still remains to be seen. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning everyone, and echo best of luck to Nick and welcome to Monish. Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks Deane. Deane Dray : I\u2019m not surprised that air quality is one of the priorities for 3M. You\u2019ve got such a big presence on the residential side with Filtrete. Where and how do you see opportunities on the commercial building side on filtration as people start venturing back to work? Are there new products that you\u2019re expecting to launch? Michael Roman : Yes Deane, you hit it. Our innovation and really a core of what we do in Filtrete has been focused on residential, both indoor air quality and, I would say, residential HVAC, together with room air purifiers being part of that. Our innovation goes into the Filtrete filters that are part of that.  The commercial side, while we contribute some of our non-woven technology, it\u2019s not a big part of our air quality growth. It\u2019s one of those areas that it\u2019s still nascent in how the innovation is going to make a difference there. We work in our innovation on opportunities there, but when we talk about the outlook for the strength in this area and the growth that we\u2019re seeing in our priority growth platform, it\u2019s really in that residential side of the marketplace. Deane Dray : Got it. Then for 2020, how do new product introductions shape up - again, this is a strange year, but in terms of product launches and contributions? Michael Roman : Yes, it\u2019s still the heart of 3M is our innovation. It comes through in those new product launches. We highlighted a little bit the benefit we\u2019re seeing in these priority growth platforms, but it\u2019s much broader than that. We continue to launch new products and like everything else, we\u2019re adjusting in the middle of COVID, prioritizing where we see market opportunities, and I would say in some cases you see in our capex delaying some of the investments as we see slowness in markets. Now, we have plans for robust new product launches in the second half of the year. It\u2019s going to be still a critical part of our growth drivers, so it doesn\u2019t change, we just have to adjust to the market opportunities, and I would say too the pace of investment as we go through the rest of the year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz, Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Nick, thanks for all your help, much appreciated. Monish, welcome. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Just focusing on safety and industrial for a second, the margin performance in the quarter was strong. Can you give us a little more color in terms of what led to the margin improvement in the quarter? Is the big increase in mask sales actually helping mix? Is it realignment that that\u2019s now helping that segment, and would you expect to see this kind of performance we saw in safety and industrial moving forward? Nicholas Gangestad : Yes Andy, in total the fact that our revenue was down year-on-year, we\u2019re not seeing a benefit margin in our safety and industrial business from the combination of the higher respirator sales and the lower sales in the rest. Those look pretty much as a push to us. The 180 basis point margin expansion, some of that is coming from that $400 million of cost actions that we\u2019re doing, that safety and industrial had its share of that, but this was also a business where we were taking actions last year in restructuring, so the lack of repeat of that expense plus the positive benefit of that restructuring, all of those things in combination led to that 180 basis point margin expansion. It\u2019s really not a mix or a respirator story.  Then going forward, we do see continued margin expansion potential in this business going forward, possibly not on the same scale as what we saw here in regards to the margin guidance that we provided, but it\u2019s still a business where we see upside on the margin on a year-on-year basis. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Nick. Then just focusing geographically again, China seems to be continuing to improve, but Japan looked worse and Latin America looked expectedly weak, so can you talk about Asia and some of the other emerging markets? It seems like China continues with more of a V-shaped recovery for you guys. Is that what you\u2019re seeing? And then why did Japan turn down in Q2? Michael Roman : Yes Andy, we are seeing that recovery in China, and I highlighted earlier it\u2019s really across safety and industrial, transportation and electronics leading the improvements there as we move ahead. Healthcare is still slow as elective surgeries even--or elective procedures come back in China as well. We are--you know, we see that, as I highlighted, continuing as we start the third quarter. Japan was down 12% in the quarter, really seeing declines in safety industrial and consumer, transportation electronics as well, so it\u2019s a broad-based slowness there. I think we\u2019re seeing that across geographies, that there\u2019s kind of a sequence to things. You\u2019re seeing the earlier recovery in China, then you see EMEA, Americas, and Japan, other parts of Asia kind of going through--a step behind that, and we saw some of that in Japan as we went through the second quarter. Operator : The last question is from Markus Mittermaier, UBS. Go ahead. Markus Mittermaier : Hi, good morning everyone, and again welcome Monish, thanks Nick for all your help, and all the best. Nicholas Gangestad : Thanks Markus. Markus Mittermaier : If I can maybe come back to just the monthly data - sorry for that. Mike, Nick, when we spoke intra-quarter, we talked about the billing day adjustments that we would have to make in May and June, and if I do that arithmetic, I actually see June down significantly more than May was, which surprised me a bit. Then correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but did you say July, the low single digit number, was that all-in or was that organic? Maybe let\u2019s start here. Nicholas Gangestad : Yes, when we look at on a per-billing day sales from April to May to June, we saw an improvement each of those months. However, that\u2019s a normal pattern for us. It\u2019s a normal pattern as we go through the second quarter that May and June sales per billing day goes up, and we saw that again this year. So in a year-on-year growth comparison, what we saw on a per-billing day was very comparable, about the same growth on a sales per billing day in May as what we saw in June. What we\u2019re seeing now in July is now a more noticeable direction change, where on a sales per billing day and on an absolute basis, we are seeing it up low single digits versus where we were in July of last year. Markus Mittermaier : Okay, thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll come back to that after the call, just to make sure. Then on the interim consent order with ADEM in your prepared remarks, is that something that you had already provisioned for before, because in the special items, if I look at it, there were no litigation-related charges in the quarter. Is that something that\u2019s still coming up, or is that something that was already provisioned for in the past? Michael Roman : Markus, the announcement on ADEM, that\u2019s something that we had previously disclosed, and we\u2019ve reached an interim consent order in partnership with ADEM, so this will have requirements as we move ahead. What we know about remediation that\u2019s probable and estimable is part of our reserve, but there will also be capital and operating costs that go along with complying with the consent order. It\u2019s not expected to be material for 3M, but it is something that will become part of our operational costs as we move ahead. Operator : That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing remarks. Michael Roman : To wrap up, the 3M team delivered another strong operational performance in the second quarter. In a challenging environment, we posted robust cash flow, managed costs, and continued to invest for the future. We will continue to fight COVID-19 from all angles, and we are well positioned to deliver value for our customers and shareholders during the pandemic and as the economy recovers.  Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and answer-session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 27, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 business review.  With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, along with Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments and then we'll open it up for questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to slide 2. Let me remind you to mark your calendars for our fourth quarter earnings call, which will take place on Tuesday, January 26, 2021. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q, lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments in today's press release. Please note, we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today's press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to slide 4, and I will hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy, and I thank you for joining us. As you have seen in our monthly sales reports, we saw a significant improvement sequentially in trends versus Q2 across businesses and geographies and we returned to positive year-over-year organic growth. While we remain in a highly uncertain economic environment, it is a credit to our team that 3M continues to execute well, deliver value to our customers, and fight the pandemic from every angle. We continue to prioritize protecting our employees, frontline health care workers and the public, while supporting the reopening of economies around the world. We have distributed 1.4 billion respirators year-to-date on track to two billion by the end of 2020. And we will exit the year at an annual run rate of 2.4 billion as we continue to add capacity. 3M innovations are also supporting the development of new vaccines and lower cost testing methods that can be mass produced. Our operational performance was strong and we posted another quarter of robust cash flow aggressively managed costs and further strengthened our balance sheet. Though our focus remains on executing in this environment, we are also looking ahead and investing in both growth and productivity, while advancing our core values including sustainability, diversity and inclusion. Overall, we are confident in our ability to lead in the economic recovery as we take actions to transform 3M and realize new opportunities from emerging customer needs and global market trends. Please turn to slide 5. Company wide total sales increased 5% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $8.4 billion, slightly above our estimates. With respect to organic sales, we delivered growth of 1% year-over-year with adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share. In the third quarter, demand remains strong in personal safety along with areas such as home improvement, data centers and biopharma filtration, and we see continued momentum in these end markets into October. While we saw improvement in other end markets versus the second quarter, many remain down year-over-year, including health care elective procedures, auto OEM and general industrial. Geographically, we experienced notable improvement in the Americas, led by the U.S., up 5% organically with strong growth in personal safety, consumer and health care. EMEA was flat versus down 15% in Q2, while Asia Pacific was down 3% organically. We delivered growth of 8% in China with all business groups above 6% offset by Japanm which continues to be challenged. Our execution was strong as we posted adjusted EBITDA margins of 29% with all business groups at/or above 27%. Our adjusted free cash flow increased to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date we have expanded cash flow by 19% and are on track to deliver another record performance in 2020. Continued strong cash flow has enabled us to reduce net debt by $2.8 billion, while returning $2.5 billion in dividends to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. Looking ahead, this continues to be an uncertain environment and customers and channel partners remain cautious. We will stay focused on serving our customers, driving operational improvement and investing for the future. Please turn to slide 6. Over the past several months, customer and stakeholder trust in 3M has grown because of how we have delivered through the pandemic. COVID-19 is rapidly changing the global economy and the way people live, work and communicate. Years worth of changes are unfolding in a matter of months, creating opportunities to unleash the power of 3M science to drive sustainable long-term growth. For example, with people at home more, there is growing demand for products to both maintain and improve households. This includes indoor air quality solutions where we've increased investments in our Filtrete portfolio to introduce new innovative products and create additional capacity. As a result, our air quality platform has grown double-digits year-to-date as we keep families healthier and more productive and we expect this market trend to continue. An increased focus in other areas like personal safety, automotive electrification and biopharma filtration to name a few also open additional opportunities for 3M. At the same time, end markets like office, hospitality and oil and gas have been highly impacted by COVID-19 and are declining as a result. To strengthen our competitive edge, we will invest where demand is strong, pull back where needed, stay close to our customers and create new innovations that address global market trends. We execute these strategies in normal times, but in the unprecedented times, we are in now prioritization is especially important. I'm also encouraged with the benefits from the new global operating model we implemented this year, a significant step in our transformation designed to improve growth and efficiency and allow us to adjust faster than ever to the external environment. During COVID-19, the strength of our model has never been clearer from our ability to deliver a threefold increase in global respirator production this year to the reconfiguration of our supply chain that enabled us to import more than 200 million respirators into the U.S. from Asia Pacific. In a matter of weeks, we also fully scaled up 2 new respirator lines at a plant in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, a process that would normally take several months. Those lines are now operating at rates 30% above similar lines as we've incorporated significant new technologies and analytic platforms and we continue to further optimize production volumes. While we have made progress, more work remains to build a stronger and more agile enterprise. Moving forward we will continue to optimize our new model, digitize our operations and improve the customer experience. All of these actions combined with relentless focus on operational execution will enable us to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders as economies recover from the impact of COVID-19. That wraps up my opening comments and I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the details of the quarter and our perspective on Q4. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a good morning. Please turn to slide 7. Company-wide third quarter sales were $8.4 billion, up 4.5% year-on-year with adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion in line with last year. Third quarter adjusted operating margins were 22.9% versus 23.8% last year. As the company disclosed and you may recall, we recorded a $58 million gain from the sale of real estate in Q3 last year. This gain produced a 70 basis point headwind year-on-year to adjust operating margins. Turning to this year's third quarter. Our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts were more than offset by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a net 50 basis point reduction to margins versus last year. Acquisitions and divestitures lowered margins by 20 basis points year-on-year, which includes a negative 50 basis point headwind from the Acelity acquisition due to purchase accounting impacts. Operationally, Acelity delivered a solid third quarter as health care elective procedures picked up sequentially. Based on Acelity's first year performance and integration progress, we are confident in the long-term success of this business. Please note that Acelity will now be reported as part of our organic results starting in Q4. Higher selling prices combined with lower raw material costs contributed 80 basis points to third quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 30 basis points. Let's now turn to slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.43 per share versus $2.58 per share last year. The $0.15 year-on-year earnings decline is primarily due to 2 items : first as discussed on the prior slide, the Q3 2019 $58 million real estate gain resulted in an $0.08 per share earnings headwind year-on-year; and second, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.4% versus 19% last year, resulting in an $0.08 year-on-year headwind to earnings per share. This headwind is primarily a function of last year's tax rate. Finally, acquisitions and divestitures contributed $0.01 to earnings. Please turn to slide nine for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow, with third quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The third quarter cash flow performance was driven by a significant improvement in working capital, which contributed over $330 million of cash. Of note, we delivered an underlying decline in inventory of $240 million since the end of Q2. This reduction was largely driven by the 16% sequential improvement in sales, along with our continued work to improve inventory velocity. Looking ahead, we will continue to adjust our manufacturing production and inventory levels to meet changing customer demand trends, as the impact of the pandemic on the economy evolves. While the working capital progress is encouraging, the team continues to work on improving operating rigor through daily management to drive sustainable long-lasting improvement. Year-to-date, we have generated adjusted free cash flow of $4.6 billion, up 19% versus last year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $368 million and nearly $1.1 billion year-to-date. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion versus approximately $1.4 billion previously. During the third quarter, we returned $847 million to our shareholders via dividends. Share repurchases remained suspended throughout the quarter, given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong third quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.3 billion or 8% sequentially. Year-to-date, we have improved our net debt position by $2.8 billion or 16% since the start of the year. Looking ahead, our priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to focus on driving strong cash flow performance, maintaining disciplined capital allocation, while continuing to strengthen our financial flexibility to invest in our business and to return cash to our shareholders. Please turn to slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.9% year-on-year in the third quarter. Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, as we continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand for respirators globally in response to the pandemic. Automotive aftermarket improved sequentially and was up 1% year-on-year, as auto body shops reopened after the economic shutdowns in Q2. The strong growth in the residential housing market continued to drive good performance in our Roofing Granules business, which was up low teens organically versus Q3 of last year. The balance of the safety and industrial portfolio, namely abrasives, closure and masking systems, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets improved sequentially, but remained down year-over-year organically, as customers and channel partners remain cautious given the continued macroeconomics uncertainty. Looking geographically, the Americas grew 11% organically with the U.S. up low teens. EMEA also grew 8%, while Asia Pacific was down low single digits. Safety and industrial's third quarter segment operating margins were 27.2%, up 430 basis points driven by sales growth, continued strong productivity and spending discipline. Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Third quarter sales were down 7.1% organically compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was up 1%, with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year weakness in consumer electronics, particularly in smartphones. Our auto OEM business was down 4% year-on-year compared to the 3% decline in global car and light truck builds. Year-to-date, our automotive business has outperformed global builds by approximately 400 basis points. Beyond automotive builds, the pandemic also continues to have negative impacts on end markets such as hospitality, oil and gas, advertising and highway infrastructure due to social distancing and work-from-home protocols. These soft end market trends, resulted in year-on-year organic sales declines in our commercial solutions, transportation safety and advanced material businesses. Geographically, Asia Pacific declined 3% and while the Americas declined 11% and EMEA was down 16%. Transportation and Electronics third quarter operating margins were 23.9%, negatively impacted by the 7% decline in organic sales which was partially offset by continued cost discipline. Turning to Healthcare. Both organic growth and operating margins in this business improved from Q2 levels, as elective health care and oral care procedure volumes improved after experiencing significant pandemic-related challenges and disruptions across the industry in the second quarter. Overall, our Healthcare business delivered Q3 organic sales growth of 8.1% year-on-year with operating margins of 23.5%. Medical Solutions grew mid-teens, including the impact from continued strong pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators to protect frontline healthcare workers. Excluding the respiratory impact, this business declined low single-digits as elective procedures remain significantly below 2019 levels. Our oral care business returned to positive growth in Q3 up low single-digits organically driven by the reopening of dental offices globally and the rebuild of channel inventories. Looking ahead, while we have seen improvement in both medical and dental procedures, currently procedures are leveling off and are forecasted to remain below pre-COVID levels through the end of 2021. Our separation and purification business increased low-teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience strong demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceuticals industries' research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Turning to health information systems. This business declined mid single-digits organically in the quarter as hospitals remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety declined low single-digits as the pandemic and related prevention protocols continue to negatively impact the food services industry. Looking geographically, the Americas grew 13% EMEA also grew 9%, while Asia Pacific declined 4%. As I mentioned Healthcare's third quarter operating margins were 23.5% down 320 basis points year-on-year. Margins were negatively impacted by the Acelity acquisition and investments in productivity and growth, which were partially offset by the ongoing cost discipline. Looking sequentially, operating margins improved 670 basis points with 60% sequential leverage on 18% growth in sales. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer Business was up 5.5%. Organic sales growth within Consumer continued to be led by our home improvement and home care businesses each up low double-digits organically. Growth in these businesses was driven by strong customer demand for our Filtrete air filtration products ScotchBlue Painter's Tapes, Command Wall Hanging products, Meguiar's car care products and Scotch-Brite cleaning products and solutions. Stationery and office declined double-digits as a result of many business offices and schools remaining partially or fully closed due to the pandemic. Looking at Consumer geographically, the Americas led up 7% organically; and EMEA grew 5%, while Asia Pacific declined 1%. Consumer's operating margins were 25.3% up 200 basis points on strong organic sales growth and cost discipline. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to step-up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. That wraps up my review of our third quarter business performance. In summary, we continue to execute well in a highly fluid and uncertain macro environment. We returned to positive organic sales growth, delivered solid operating margins of nearly 23%, increased adjusted free cash by 13%, reduced net debt by 8%, while also investing in both growth and productivity. Please turn to slide 11 and I will discuss our thoughts on Q4. As we enter the fourth quarter, significant economic and end market uncertainty continues to persist, as both global GDP and IPI are currently forecasted to remain negative year-on-year. Therefore, we remain cautious as the impacts of the pandemic on the global economy and end markets continues to evolve. From an end market perspective, we do expect continued strength in certain end markets. Namely personal safety, home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data centers and biopharma filtration. At the same time year-on-year declines across many end markets, such as health care and oral care elective procedures, automotive OEM, general industrial, consumer electronics, hospitality and the office supplies are expected to persist through the balance of this year. In fact, many of these end markets are not expected to recover to pre-COVID levels until well into 2021 or beyond. Turning to our business. We currently estimate October total company sales growth to be flat to up low single-digits, which incorporates the anticipated impact of one fewer business day year-on-year. Please note, relative to business days that there is no year-on-year impact for the fourth quarter. However, on a sequential basis, we will have two fewer business days in Q4 as compared to Q3 this year. As we have done over the past several months, we will provide a monthly sales information through the end of the year due to the continued global macroeconomic uncertainty. Therefore, we will report October sales once we have finalized those results in a few weeks. Regarding disposable respirators, we expect continued strong demand, which we anticipate will contribute approximately 300 basis points to company-wide Q4 total sales growth. And as a reminder, we will have a negative fourth quarter sales impact year-on-year of approximately $100 million 130 basis points from our May 2020 divestiture of drug delivery. From an operational standpoint, we will maintain a strong focus on cost management, while continuing to invest in both growth and productivity. With this in mind, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted operating margins of approximately 21%. Finally, we remain focused on generating strong cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility. To wrap up, I would like to thank all 3Mers for the hard work this quarter and the progress that we have made. In the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do. Our team remains focused on fighting the pandemic from all angles, relentlessly serving our customers, delivering growth in revenue, margin and cash, strengthening our balance sheet and driving operating rigor through daily management. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hi, Dean. Deane Dray : Just with respect to the precision that you can provide and have been providing on the contribution from respirators, is it possible to give a \u2013 take a stab at a net COVID impact across 3M, or maybe the size like the key positives and key negatives? And positives, I would imagine are other PPE and the home improvement trends and so forth. But if you could net \u2013 size the biggest outliers on both sides of that equation and how you think that nets out as you see it today? Mike Roman : Yes. And Dean, I would start with our entire business portfolio has been impacted one way or another from COVID-19. We talked about respirators, about 300 basis points of growth impact on the enterprise from that demand that we're seeing in respirators. But half of our businesses do remain down year-on-year. So we highlighted a couple of others that are up. You hit them as well. Our home improvement business, our separation, purification, our biopharma filtration business. Those are both up low teens. You look at some of the ones that have been impacted negatively, our office markets I would say in our hospitality kind of the commercial solutions those are both down low teens. So, it kind of gives you a view of how the impact plays out on both sides of that, both the positive demand and some of the impacts negatively from COVID. Monish Patolawala : I would just add Dean I think the other piece is we've also hit on elective procedures. So they are also down year-over-year. So that impacts our health care business. And then on the positive side too, the other piece I would throw out is, as the economy moves to a digital-first, thinking about how we play in our semiconductor space, data centers, factory automation is another area of strength that has helped us and through COVID. Deane Dray : Got that. And then, as a follow-up, when I looked at the guidance that you had given or the framework for the third quarter and you came in pretty darn close to -- and actually above on revenues and above on margins. What might be the prospects for restoring guidance? I know you've given our framework for 4Q. But just if you -- in the position, we are pretty darn close at this stage, when might guidance be restored? And when might you restore buybacks? I mean, you commented on disciplined capital allocation, but you had really good cash flow. You paid down debt when might buybacks be restored? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yes. Deane, maybe I'll take the first part of that and just talk about how we think about guidance. And as we went through Q3 and got halfway through September, we did give you an estimate of how we were seeing sales. Behind that still, a lot of uncertainty about, how this is going to play out, how the economy is going to impact the businesses we were just talking about. And that remains true today. There's -- the current environment, it remains uncertain. So we continue to keep our guidance withdrawn. We're going to focus on executing well against what we see coming and we'll continue to report monthly sales. As soon as we get better visibility of the market outlook and the trends, then we will look at bringing back a view of guidance. But for now, we'll stay with the monthly sales reports. Monish Patolawala : And as I go to capital allocation Deane, just our priorities haven't changed. We've -- what we've always said is our first priority is investing organically because that's where we believe we get the best return. Our second priority has been paying dividends. Dividends has been a hallmark of 3M and I know our investors care about it. So that's our second priority. And then our third priority is M&A. And then with that is share buyback. So that's the way we look at our four. As you know through the pandemic and through the uncertainty that's going on, we have strengthened the financial position as you saw by reducing net debt. We also suspended share buyback at the end of first quarter. And right now, as we have announced our share buyback remains withdrawn. We are working on 2021. We have multiple scenarios. And as we finalize that, we'll keep you updated as appropriate. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Monish Patolawala : Hey Scott. Mike Roman : Hi Scott. Scott Davis : Are you guys surprised at all that Health Care margins weren't a little bit better, just given the 8% growth, the operating leverage that you would typically get from that? Monish Patolawala : No. I think -- I would say Scott, we are pretty much online. The team has done a nice job of controlling costs. As you can see sequentially, our margin rates have gone up 670 basis points. And that's driven a lot by the fact that the team has done a nice job as well as the volumes have picked up, you get the operating leverage and that's what we've seen, so nothing untoward. The thing that you also have to keep in mind on a year-over-year basis, as we bought Acelity and the impact of the purchase accounting nearly causes a 220 basis point drag on a year-over-year basis due to purchase accounting. Scott Davis : Yes. I saw that. So -- okay. I'll move on. The price in the quarter that you quoted in the earlier slide, I think 60 basis points I believe. That's a pretty good number in a recession, particularly given that raw material costs are low, so it's not pushing up price. Is that -- is there any way to kind of tease that out? Is that new product? And so therefore, it's kind of partially price mix? Is it just the fact that there's certain products you have that are in really high demand right now and so you're getting price in that area? Just maybe some high-level commentary there would be helpful. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Scott. Price was 60 basis points and I agree with you, the team has done a good job of driving it. But as you know that's the innovation model. The company has historically managed to get 30 to 50 basis points and part of it is just the strength of the innovation and the customer value we add. On the price over 60, I would say the Americas and the EMEA were both that we saw price increase. Asia Pacific was down on year-over-year. And I would say there's nothing I would call out as specific or one product line that drove it. It's a general increase that we have seen across multiple markets and the products that we have introduced this year as well as the pricing actions that were put into place at the beginning of the year and they are holding. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. Good luck guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Mike Roman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Roman : Hey Nigel. Monish Patolawala : Hi Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes, hi. I'm just kind of curious on the sequential trends and obviously you've given some decent information on what you've seen in October. But it does seem like on a daily sales basis September was a bit weaker than what you saw in July August. And maybe October got a little bit better than September. I mean again I don't want to sort of play the interest here, but can you just make comments number one if that's kind of correct on a daily sales basis? And then secondly, what you're seeing in terms of channels by business if possible. And kind of did we see a big restock through the summer that perhaps has now played through? Any information on that would be great. Mike Roman : Yes, Nigel maybe I'll start with the second part of that. Just looking at the channel we haven't seen strong restocking across most of our portfolio. Maybe some in Health Care as elective procedures have come back. And I would say otherwise the channel has been cautious and we haven't seen a strong restocking as we went through third quarter even as we come into October. So, if you think about how sales trended as we went through Q3, we came in a bit better than the range that we said the $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. Overall, revenues were pretty consistent through the quarter, two months we had sales we were up about 4%. For the full quarter we grew about 4.5%. Normally -- and I would say pre-COVID, we would see a strong upward trend as we go through September and as the quarter progresses. In both Q2 and Q3 that trend is there, but not at the historical level. So, looking through that and then what Monish mentioned about October that through the early part of October, we're seeing flat to low single-digits, the sales trends have been pretty steady through the interim quarter of Q3 into the start of Q4. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. Well, I'll follow up offline with Bruce on that. And then my follow-up question is on inventories. You've taken down inventories a fair bit into -- from 2Q to 3Q, I think down roughly $200 million implies that your production volumes were down probably low single-digits year-over-year. So, I'm curious if that had an impact on fixed cost absorption because the margins were pretty impressive. So, I'm just wondering if there was a drag from that inventory reduction. And then do you expect to continue reducing inventories into 4Q and probably 2021? Monish Patolawala : Sure. I'll just start with the first one. So, the team's done a nice job on inventory reduction. As I said earlier, I would say there are two pieces that drove it. One is you saw the volumes quarter-over-quarter sequentially up nearly 16%. I would say that's just number one that drove it. And secondly the team has been focused and is focused on driving inventory velocity up. And those are the two factors. For example they started doing -- using a lot of data and analytics that helps us decide where our inventory level should be. There's always more work to do there, but that's another driver of how we were able to drive this down. I would say to your second question on do you see it going down or not, I think our philosophy hasn't changed on making sure that our inventory levels keep going down and our velocity keeps going up. But it's an extremely uncertain environment. So, you're seeing markets that are up a lot. You're seeing product lines that are down a lot. Mike already touched about some of the lines where we were down double-digits and some other lines where we were way up double-digits. So, I think that's what we are working on balancing. So, we'll decide as the pandemic settles out what our production level should be what our inventory level should be. But overall, I would count on you -- count on us to make sure that our inventory levels from a velocity perspective keep improving. And then your last question on manufacturing unabsorbed cost. So, as you know some lines were up or down. We have incurred costs which is approximately $35 million of fixed cost that are unabsorbed manufacturing variances. Nigel Coe : I think I've got five questions. So, I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Monish Patolawala : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Hey Andy. Monish Patolawala : Hey Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Monish maybe you can give us a little more color into your adjusted operating margin guidance the 21% for Q4. You obviously recorded a much higher margin than that in Q3. Incrementals were good sequentially above 40%. Obviously, we know two fewer selling days so lower sales. But is there any other margin impacts on the business in Q4 versus Q3 mix or maybe you expect temporary costs to come back faster in Q4? Monish Patolawala : So, I would say Andy, there are quite a few factors that go into it so I'll just start again with just with the uncertainty that's in the market and volume is a big driver of it. We are seeing GDP and IPI both are going to be down year-over-year or projected to be down. We have also seen uncertainty in the market. In general, we are seeing places where for example where I said healthcare procedures are leveling customers are remaining cautious et cetera. So, there's a lot of uncertainty in that market. On the flip side, we continue to see pretty good end market trends whether it is on our personal safety, our home cleanliness, and our home improvement business, and then biopharma filtration. So, when you put all that together the team will continue to monitor that as the economy evolves. We are continuing to focus on making sure that we have cost -- we are being very cautious on cost. But at the same time we will invest in growth and productivity where required. So, you're going to see both sides here. You saw us talking about investing in some of these segments that we see that in the longer run we have growth potential. So, with all that put together, as well as just remember, sequentially historically two \u2013 Q3 versus Q4 we always see a drop in margins. Q4 is the lowest for 3M, and part of that is driven by just the two lower billing days that you get on a year-over-year basis. So the fixed cost gets spread over a shorter number of days. So with all that put together, we believe right now the line of sight we have is to 21%. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Monish. And then maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you give us more color into the margin performance in Safety and Industrial and Consumer? The margins you recorded in Q3 in both those segments, we really haven't seen those kind of margins from 3M in those segments. So maybe the sustainability, if temporary costs come back how much of the sort of tailwind that you're seeing is from some of the long-term things you've been doing like transformation factory optimization? I think you mentioned advertising, maybe you're doing less advertising consumer but do you see these types of margins being sustainable as you go forward in these two segments and as you go into 2021? Monish Patolawala : Sure. I'll start with just giving you the reasons for the strong growth, and then I'll talk about what we think about the future. On the growth in SIBG, the margins were driven by two pieces. One is extremely strong demand for our respirator business. So that's one as well as our sequential improvement pretty much across all the industrial product lines have helped us from an overall cost position. And secondly, the team has done a great job of being very cautious on how much \u2013 on being cautious about the spending levels, and I think both of that. But at the same time, the industrial business the Safety and Industrial has continued to invest also where we see the growth opportunities. And then on the consumer side, it's driven again by strong growth in our home care business and our home improvement business, which has also helped us from a margin rate perspective. The point on advertising and merchandising that I was bringing on is the team has spent what they think is appropriate in this environment. But as we are starting to see markets come back up and seeing some of the future trends in this area, we are going to continue to invest in advertising and merchandising, as well as investing in new product innovation as required. But I think, I would say that in general is the philosophy that we're going to follow, which is we're going to invest in growth and productivity in areas that we feel that has long-term potential for 3M. At the same time, we'll dial back in areas or reprioritize in areas that we feel in the short run may not give us the big bang for the buck. So that's the way we would think about it. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Hi, John. Monish Patolawala : Hi, John. John Walsh : So wanted to go back to kind of the capital allocation strategy. If we take where you ended this quarter after some delevering actions just \u2013 I'll use consensus numbers here but you take what you're forecasted for free cash flow less the dividend. You look at the EBITDA projections, I mean, there's a path here for you to end next year below 1.5 turns of net leverage. Is that where you're trying to get to? Would you push back on any of that? I just wanted to get your thoughts on where you actually want to get the net leverage down to? Monish Patolawala : Sure, John. As Nick and Mike had said before my time too, the company wanted to get below sub-two on a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage and we are right now where we are. So we are at 1.8 at the end of Q3. The way I look at it is again, it's an extremely uncertain environment right now. So we don't have any target that we're going other than we want to keep strengthening the balance sheet keep giving us the financial flexibility and that's what we are doing. As we get into 2021, we'll see how the world looks like from that trend. And at that point, we'll make a decision. But you should just count on 3M to have a strong balance sheet and that's what we're going towards. John Walsh : Got you. Thank you for that. And then just thinking about some of the uses of that potentially any update here around environmental thinking about an EPA action plan and/or anything on the calendar just for investors to be aware as we think about what 2021 looks like? I think you provided an update last quarter, was just curious if anything changed? Mike Roman : Yeah, John maybe I'll start where we always start. We're proactively managing that really EHS and PFAS kinds of strategies. And we do that around sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency. So, trying to keep you updated as we go here. And your question about EPA, we've been supportive of the EPA's plan for managing PFAS and we've been working in support of them with our commitments to provide a clearing house of information around that. When you look at \u2013 how do we look at 2020 and 2021? I would say, we continue to work as 3M around our manufacturing sites around historical disposal. And we continue to make progress on that. When you look at potential other actions and other EHS matters, I would say, there's been a slowdown with some litigation actions as part of that in the middle of COVID. So now we're looking at trials and related matters next year, first half of next year. So whether it's bellwether trials in Michigan or the multi-district litigation actions those are coming now sometime early to the first half of next year. So nothing more. We -- the reserves that we've taken for the work that we've been doing on our manufacturing sites, those are -- those cover what we see as probable and less mobile today. So that gives you kind of an updated outlook into early next year. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Mike Roman : Thanks John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Thank you and good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Nice sequential improvement on Health Care but sort of longer-term question. This used to be 28% 30% margin business. Or another way to ask is in 2017, 2018 you could make around $500 billion with $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of revenue and now sort of takes $2.2 billion of revenue to make that. Can you just bridge the gap where we were and where we are now. And I get that Acelity is 200 basis points plus. But what are the other big buckets that sort of drive this decline in margin? And what would it take for it to come back? Bruce Jermeland : Yes Andrew, this is Bruce. If you look at the EBITDA margins of Health Care they're right at 30% here in the quarter. So the big driver of -- there's two items really that impact margins as you look at it historically. The realignment of the company when we move the Separation Purification business into Health Care had below-average Health Care margins. So that had a negative impact. And then secondly, the D&A associated with the Acelity acquisition is impacting the margins. So peeling that back though Health Care right now is right around 30%. So kind of back to the upper 20s to around 30% range. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then the second question is on elective procedures you sort of did -- I think you sort of indicated a slowdown in September October. Can you just comment as to what explicitly you guys are seeing on elective procedures? And are you seeing a slowdown related to the second wave of COVID? And how is the second way of COVID factoring your forecast for Health Care and across the board for the company? Mike Roman : Yes. Andrew just if you look at Q3 we saw an increase in elective procedures coming into Q3. We saw that coming out of Q2 starting and then coming into Q3. That was behind some of the improvements that you saw sequentially in the Health Care business broadly. We -- as Monish mentioned in his remarks, we've seen a flattening of elective procedures not necessarily a downturn or -- but a slowdown in a flattening as we've exited September and come into October. So back to it's -- what's driving it. There's a lot of uncertainty of will it pick back up will it stay flat. I would say, we are continuing to remain cautious there as well. Monish Patolawala : And that -- sorry go ahead. Andrew Obin : So are you effectively modeling no acceleration -- no sequential acceleration in elective procedures due to COVID? Is that just part of the framework? Monish Patolawala : So I'll just first answer a little more on with numbers. So if the U.S. and Europe with the data that we see Andrew was at the end of third quarter between the 70% to 75% of pre-COVID levels in those two parts of the world. China of course was a little higher in between the 85% to 90%. And as we said I think what we are seeing is a flattening. I think there's nervousness right now with some of -- with what's going on in the world of course with the outbreaks of COVID in a few of the regions. And we have multiple scenarios that we are watching. And as I mentioned we believe elective procedures will be down on a year-over-year basis. And you can pick that range but we believe it's going to be -- right now what we are seeing is pretty much flat October to September. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Monish Patolawala : Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie : So my first question is maybe just focused on the actions that you had announced previously. I think you had announced something like $400 million or so in cost actions in the second quarter. And I know a lot of those actions were expected to be temporary. I'm just curious how did those play out into 3Q? And is there still any kind of carryover benefit from those cost actions that we should expect into 4Q? Monish Patolawala : Sure Joe. I'll answer both separately. On the $400 million as announced and as you correctly stated most of them were temporary in nature. And some of them as we had also disclosed at the end of Q2 have a reversal impact in Q3 and Q4 especially vacation accruals become negative in Q3 and Q4, as well as the timing of our bonus accruals, AIP accruals become negative quarter-over-quarter. The overall impact of all that put together was a $50 million benefit in Q3. And then your second question on what do I see it going forward? I would say also if you recall in the second quarter we had announced some actions that we had from a restructuring perspective, but that would have an impact in 2021 and beyond. And then in the fourth quarter of 2019 also we had announced actions that we had taken as we went into the new model of the new transform way of running 3M, and there's approximately $30 million of benefit in that in the second half. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. That's helpful, Monish. And then, just my one follow-on question. I know it's probably too early to start thinking about 2021. But, you do have this phenomena this year where your respirator sales are helping to boost growth in 2020, and looks like we're going to be in this pandemic-related situation for quite some time. I guess, I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about framing what the either tailwind or headwind could potentially be in 2021 from just the respirator portion of your business? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. The way we look at it, Joe, is that we believe respiratory production continues or that demand continues for a long time. So, we continue to see, I would say, the strength from that business to grow. We are investing in capacity as we have announced. We have made around -- we'll make around two billion respirators this year. We'll exit at a run rate of 1.2 billion for the second half, which is nearly 2.4 million to 2.5 billion respirators for 2021. And so, our view is that demand remains strong. As well as, we are truly committed to fighting the pandemic from all angles, and this is just one piece of it. Between this, the home cleanliness products, the home filtration products, 3M is doing everything we can to help the world out and make it safer. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Julian. Monish Patolawala : Hi. Julian Mitchell : This maybe just -- good morning. Maybe just hopefully for you, at least one last question on healthcare margins. So, just one that I suppose maybe looking ahead, what do you think the run rate margin level is, what sort of operating leverage should we expect in that segment? Because, I understand the separation and purification, going into the segment, I understand the Acelity impact. But you look year-on-year Q3 the margin ex-Acelity is still down 100 bps of high single-digit organic growth. And I understand, sequentially the margin was up in Q3. But I'm guessing it's probably down sequentially in Q4. So just trying to take a step back from all of that looking forward, what do you think the operating leverage is in healthcare? And do you think there are kind of outsized reinvestment needs there? Monish Patolawala : So, I'll answer my question Julian, with a caveat that I'm 90 days in. But I'd start with the following that the team has done a nice job. You saw the margins rebound from Q2 to Q3 as the sequentials came through. I think for Q4, which is what we should be looking at the question that will come around is what's the volumes going to be, based on where we are with everything that we're seeing in electives and oral care. And I think that's the big piece. The team will continue to focus on making sure that we are being very cautious on what we spend on cost. But at the same time, as we start seeing the future growth come back post the pandemic, we will not hesitate to invest in growth and productivity, because this is a great franchise for us and we want to keep making sure that it has long-term growth and good margin performance too. Julian Mitchell : I see. And then maybe Monish, circling back on that cost question that Joe had touched on. If we look at say 2021, in aggregate with everything that we know today, you've got some fixed costs, I suppose, carryover savings from the Q2 actions. Maybe help us understand what that is in totality in terms of the year-on-year tailwind next year? And also, do you see any headwind next year as you sit today from temporary costs coming back, or those all came back in the second half of this year already? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I would say, Julian, we are busy working on building out 2021. So I'll give you definitely more detail as we get into 2021. And but as I mentioned just a few sets of numbers for you, is the action that we took in Q2 of 2020, has a tailwind of nearly $110 million in 2021, because that's the restructuring action that we'll take. The flip side of that is, as you know we have got a lot of temporary measures put into place. We have frozen contractor services, travel, et cetera, and some of that will come back on a year-over-year basis. As well as depending on what the future growth potential is, we will be investing growth and productivity at the same time. So long answer to your question that there are multiple moving pieces. We are in the midst of working through 2021, and we'll definitely keep you appraise of that as soon as we lock down on our case. Bruce Jermeland : Yeah, Julian, just let me clarify the actions we took, the $110 million related to our Q4 action we announced. Monish Patolawala : Yeah, yeah. My fault. Bruce Jermeland : The Q2 action we announced is relatively small. Monish Patolawala : Yeah. My apologies. That's right. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Great. Thanks, Monish and Bruce. Bruce Jermeland : Yeah. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Hey, Josh. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So just to move a little bit off the current quarter. And Mike you touched on it a little bit in your opening remarks, but I just want to dig in a little bit more. This lateral antigen test that you were putting together with MIT, if I'm reading this right I think some of your peers are out there making one billion of these things a year on a run rate basis. And I would suspect that 3M probably making it cheaper as more of a professional manufacturer than some of these other folks and given the mediums you're working with. How big could this be? Is this something that's any closer to deployment? Because I think going hand-in-hand with needing masks for a while is we're probably going to need tests for a while too. Mike Roman : Yes. Josh, let me give you maybe an update here. So this is the testing work that we're doing with MIT as a partner sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. And this has been a focus on a low-cost highly accurate paper-based device that can be mass manufactured. So, large numbers like you're talking about. And so where we're at we've created a prototype of that. And it's -- this is a saliva-based test and we've demonstrated sensitivity in the lab. And we're currently in a phase where it's being validated by an outside laboratory, and this includes a number of -- a series of tests including test against live samples positives, negatives really to determine how good it is at detecting COVID-19 and accurately. And so if that goes well then we would be looking at ramping it up to production. We would be -- the next step would be to work with the FDA on an Emergency Use Authorization probably sometime in the first half of next year just to give you a little bit of the time line. But it is something that would be a volume based low cost test that could be used broadly. So, we're excited about the partnership. We're excited about the good progress to this point but more work to be done. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And just on understanding the numbers right, maybe that run rate production number that I threw out sounds like it's not too far off. But price per test, I think those peers are $5 to $10 a test. Is this sounds like you'd be on the lower end of that maybe a little bit lower, but the easy algebra there it comes over the pretty big revenue number if all that comes together. Is that that fair, but still just too early to commit to a total TAM? Mike Roman : Yes. Josh, we still have some work to do. So I'll stay with low cost for now and we'll come back as we make more progress. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Perfect. And I thanks for the time and I appreciate the color. So I\u2019ll leave it there. Mike Roman : Okay, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. Mike Roman : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just wanted to confirm. So October kind of if you adjust to days sales like up five or something like that. Is that kind of the right number adjusted for days? Mike Roman : Well, as we -- Steve, we said, it's low -- flat to low single-digits October trend. That takes into account that extra day. So, trending a little bit above that net of the extra day. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. Got it. Mike Roman : Yes. Steve Tusa : Got it. Sorry I might have missed that. And then just kind of like headed into next year on the top line. And any kind of major -- sorry on the bottom line any kind of puts and takes that we have to be aware of when it comes to pension or anything like that that's just more mechanical when thinking about next year? Monish Patolawala : Nothing that I can think of right now Steve. Again, as we get through 2021, as we finish our planning for 2021 we'll definitely keep you posted, but as of right now nothing mechanical. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. On pension, Steve, obviously, we'll see where rates are at on December 31 and that will determine what the expense is next year. Steve Tusa : Where would that -- if you snap the line today where would that be? Bruce Jermeland : No, we're not providing that at this point, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Bruce Jermeland : Yeah. Operator : Our question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question. John Inch : Yes. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning everybody. Mike Roman : Hey, John. Monish Patolawala : Hi, John. John Inch : Hi. Good morning guys. By the way I see on Page 11 you're really bullish on general cleaning. So can I ask you what were the third quarter 2020 margin benefits of past restructuring actions if we could just perhaps start there? Bruce Jermeland : Yeah. If you look at third quarter John, it's pretty minimal, because we've lapped now the Q2 actions we took a year ago. And in the Q4 actions that we announced earlier this year, they were somewhat impacted by COVID. And so we put in place for example things like hiring freezes as we've gone through COVID. So those actions are going to have more of an impact next year as Monish mentioned $110 million to $120 million, a little impact here in the second half of this year. John Inch : Okay, Bruce. So then, I mean to get to 21% margins for the fourth quarter, if you look a year ago when you add back the restructuring costs you get kind of almost 21%. So you're sort of assuming kind of flat pro forma margins. I was just wondering if you expected contribution from any kind of cost-out tailwinds or other things. Just trying to get back to the -- like to gauge how conservative you're being in terms of your fourth quarter guide of 21%? Bruce Jermeland : Yes, there is some benefit from the actions we took. But as Monish mentioned earlier John, some of the actions that we put in place in Q2 such as we encourage our employees to take half of their vacation by the middle of the year becomes a headwind in Q4 because people generally take a fair amount of vacation during the holiday. So, plus we're continuing to making sure we're investing in the business to set up success as we go into 2021. So for now 21% is where we think is appropriate as we start the quarter. John Inch : Okay. And then just secondly, where do you expect COVID sales to be in the fourth quarter versus the $235 million in the third quarter? In other words sort of how much up sequentially? And is this sequential sales trend is it accelerating, or is it sort of decelerating as the bulk of -- just to try and put all of this into the context. I realize you threw out those numbers 1.4 to 2.45 next year. But what sort of -- what's happening to the curve sequentially in terms of the contribution if you can maybe isolate that? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yes, John. So we -- as Monish mentioned, we've added capacity as we've come into the second half or brought it online capacity that we have been working on as we've gone through the year. So that will have a little bit of an impact. I think it's still in that 300 basis point range for Q4. It will be sequentially up slightly off of Q3. John Inch : Sequentially up slightly even though the fourth quarter is usually a bigger sales number though right? Mike Roman : No. John Inch : I'm not quoting. And I'm just trying to understand the context. It seems like it's holding steady. Mike Roman : Yes. Normally you see a sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. Really typically there's two days difference between Q3 and Q4. That's one of the drivers. It's -- there's the holidays have an impact. And so we -- in respirator because of the situation we're in, I would say it's going to be similar to what you saw in Q3 maybe a little bit up as we bring that additional capacity online and serve the demand out there. John Inch : And then Mike moving into 2021, do you see COVID sales sort of gently decelerating, or do you see more of a like a bit of a cliff phenom say hitting when they started to really ramp say in the second quarter or something like that? Mike Roman : John, there's still a lot of uncertainty. I mean, we see demand extending into 2021 for sure and then we're bringing that capacity on to be ready for that. Well as Monish said, we're getting kind of our view of this as we get further into Q4 and get ready for 2021. We'll come back and give you a breakdown on that. John Inch : Good though. Thanks very much. Bruce Jermeland : Thanks, John. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. It's Simon [ph] on the line for Laurence, which is a quick one. You mentioned Health Care elective demand has been weak because -- for obvious reasons. I was wondering if that has accelerated in the recent weeks just with all the headlines we're seeing with increasing COVID cases worldwide if things are getting worse in that particular sub-segment? Monish Patolawala : So we haven't seen it getting worse as of right now, Laurence. I would say we are seeing a flattening of the curve. But I'm sure as you go area-by-area depending on where local lockdowns are happening they'll have an impact. But we haven't seen that yet at our level. So we are seeing more a flattening. But this thing can change weekly depending on how it goes. So this is just an initial trend of what we're seeing right now. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : All right. Thank you. To wrap up, our operational performance was strong in the third quarter as we executed well, innovated for our customers and continued to fight the pandemic from all angles.  In a highly uncertain economic environment, our team delivered robust cash flow strong margins and return to positive organic sales growth. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in both growth and productivity and we remain confident in our ability to lead the economic recovery, deliver great value for our stakeholders and realize new opportunities from emerging market trends. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 26, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Let me begin today by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families continue to be safe and are doing well. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll open it up for questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com, under the heading quarterly earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, I would like to introduce the dates for 2021 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 27, July 27, and October 26. The please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Finally, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments in today's press release. Please note we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for reference in today's press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures. Please turn to Slide 4, and I will hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team finished the year strong as we continue to execute well, innovate for our customers and fight the pandemic from every angle. In an uncertain economic environment, we delivered organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas, along with margin expansion, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow during the fourth quarter. Throughout 2020, I am proud of how 3M stepped up to help meet the extraordinary challenges facing the world, which includes our comprehensive response to COVID-19. Last year, we also took actions to transform for the future, advanced our core values and strengthen our balance sheet through robust cash generation. At the same time, we know that more work remains to deliver for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. Moving forward, we will build on our progress and continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. 3M is well positioned as we head into 2021. And today, we are providing guidance for the year, where we expect a return to healthy growth. Overall, I'm confident in our ability to deliver a successful 2021, lead through the economic recovery and capitalize on opportunities from emerging trends that are favorable to 3M and our market-leading businesses. Please turn to Slide 5. Companywide total sales in the fourth quarter increased to $8.6 billion, with organic growth of 6% and earnings of $2.38 per share, up 22% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Demand remains strong in end markets such as personal safety, home cleaning and semiconductors and we saw a sequential improvement in general industrial and automotive OEM. We also saw ongoing weakness in other end markets, including healthcare and oral care elective procedures, which declined sequentially, as it continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Geographically, organic growth was led by the Americas, up 8%, with the United States up 9%. EMEA grew 6% and Asia Pacific grew 2% with China up 14%. Our team delivered another quarter of good operational performance. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, with all business groups above 26% and increased our adjusted cash flow to $2.1 billion. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our full-year performance, along with my perspective on 2021, after Monish takes you through the details of the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well in expanding respirator production to support pandemic-related demand. We also saw continued end market strength through year-end in automotive OEM, electronics and home improvement. Strong operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove robust adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, up 20%, with adjusted operating margins of 21.5%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components that impacted margins. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributor to a margin improvement, adding 160 basis points. Included in this 160 basis point benefit were two items that I had called out during a conference in early December. First, we exited a product line within our closure, masking and packaging business and sold the related property in Q4. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $54 million, or 60 basis points margin benefit. Please note that this gain is included in safety and industrial's Q4 operating income. And second, we had increased our respirator mask reserve by $107 million in Q4, which resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to margins year-on-year. For the full-year, we increased our respirator mask reserve by roughly $130 million, which is a little higher than the $100 million average over the last few years. This increase in our reserves is reflected in corporate and unallocated. As you may have noticed, adjusting for last year significant litigation charge, our fourth quarter corporate and unallocated expense was up approximately $100 million year-on-year. This increase was primarily driven by our update to our respirator mask reserve, along with impacts from ongoing legal costs, as we continue to manage PFAS and other legal proceedings. Turning to selling prices and raw materials, which was an 80 basis point year-on-year benefit to margins. This benefit was driven by the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material cost versus last year's fourth quarter. Note, approximately half of our fourth quarter selling price performance was benefited by lower year-on-year volume-related customer rebates and markets that were most impacted by the pandemic. Acquisition and divestitures contributed 10 basis points year-on-year. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 10 basis points. And lastly, while the fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $137 million was similar to last year's charge, restructuring provided a 10 basis point benefit to margins year-on-year due to this year's higher sales. Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.38 per share, up 22% from last year on an adjusted basis. First, as discussed on the prior slide, organic growth and ongoing cost management and productivity efforts delivered $0.43 per share to earnings growth. This included a $0.09 benefit from the gain on sale of property and a $0.10 headwind from the increased respirator mask reserved. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced earnings by $0.02 and foreign exchange impacts added $0.02 to per share earnings year-on-year. The strength of the 3M business model, strong cash flow and liquidity position gave us the opportunity in Q4 to retire $1 billion of debt early that was due to mature in 2021. As a result, we incurred higher net interest in the quarter, which combined with higher shares outstanding, reduced earnings by $0.03. Finally, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of the mix of pre-tax income around the world. Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with conversion of 151%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust income and daily management of working capital. For the full-year, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $6.7 billion, up 18%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $422 million and were $1.5 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to our shareholders via dividends and $3.4 billion for the year. Share repurchases remains suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduce net debt by $1.3 billion or 9% sequentially. For the year, we improved our net debt position by $4.1 billion, or 23%. As a result, we exited the year with net debt to EBITDA of 1.5 down from 2.3 at the end of 2019. This significant improvement in our net debt position, along with a strong cash flow generation capability provides us increased financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 9 where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with that Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 11.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result includes an approximate 10 percentage point benefit from pandemic related respirator mass demand. Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q4. However, customers and channel partners continue to remain cautious given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Personal safety posted double digit organic growth year-on-year driven by continued demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits while the electrical markets business was up low single digits. The strong growth in the residential housing market continued to drive good performance and our roofing granules business which was up double digits organically versus Q4 of last year. The rest of the Safety and Industrial portfolio, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking declined year-on-year. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter segment operating margins were 27.7%, up 690 basis points driven by strong leverage on sales growth and continued productivity and spending discipline along with the previously mentioned gain on sale of real estate. Moving to Transportation and Electronics; after a challenging last two years, fourth quarter organic sales growth turned positive, up 1.4% as compared to last year. Our electronics related business was up 2% with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year softness in consumer electronics. Our auto OEM business was up 18% year-on-year compared to the 3% increase in global car and light truck builds. For the full year, our automotive business outperformed global builds by approximately 700 basis points. Advanced Materials and transportation safety return to growth year-on-year, driven by improving end market trends in automotive and highway infrastructure. Commercial solutions continued to be down year-on-year due to negative pandemic related impacts on advertising spend, and demand for workplace cleaning and safety products and solutions. Transportation and Electronics' fourth quarter operating margins were 21.8%, up 100 basis points on positive sales growth and continued cost discipline. Turning to Health Care; some parts of the world were challenged with rising COVID-19 cases throughout Q4. As a result, those health care providers experienced sequential declines in the elective procedure volumes, which negatively impacted parts of our business. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered fourth quarter organic sales growth of 6.6% versus last year. The medical solutions business grew low double digits, driven by continued strong respiratory demand. Excluding respirators organic growth in this business was flat. Our oral care business organic sales were flat year-over-year, as it dealt with rising COVID cases. The separation and purification business increased low double digits year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry's research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. Turning to Health Information Systems, which declined mid-single digits organically, as hospitals continued to remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety was up low single digits organically versus last year. Health Care's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.7%, up 340 basis points year-on-year with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.7%. Fourth quarter margins were driven by continued strong execution and cost management, which was partially offset by the higher year-on-year restructuring costs. Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was up 10% as retailers saw continued strong customer demand throughout the holiday season. Growth in this business continues to be driven by strong consumer demand for a category leading brands namely Filtrete, Scotch, Scotch blue, Scotch Brite, Command and McGuires. We also continue to see very strong growth in e-commerce channels, as the pandemic has accelerated years' worth of changes in consumer shopping behavior. Organic sales growth within consumer continued to be led by a home improvement and home care businesses each up double digits organically. Stationery and office declined low single digits as many business offices and schools remain partially or fully closed due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Consumer's operating margins were 23.5% or similar to last year. As we previously mentioned, we have been stepping up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. Lastly, similar to Health Care, operating margins were impacted by higher year-on-year restructuring costs. That wraps up the review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 10. And I will hand it back over to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Monish. Looking at our 2020 performance, we posted an organic sales decline of 2% and adjusted earnings of $8.74 per share. We increased adjusted free cash flow by 18% to $6.7 billion with a conversion rate of 132% which demonstrates the strength of our business model, and our continued ability to perform across economic cycles. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Our strong cash flow along with disciplined capital allocation helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. During the year, we strengthened our Health Care portfolio with a successful integration of Acelity and the completion of the divestiture of drug delivery. We returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Beyond financial results, 2020 was a year where 3M stepped up when we were needed the most. Please turn to Slide 11. Throughout the pandemic, 3Mers have been relentless in applying science to improve lives and make the world a better place. Our COVID-19 response has been guided by three priorities, protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle, and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Beginning last January, we immediately activated our surge capacity, and doubled our production of respirators to help protect nurses, doctors and first responders. We have since worked tirelessly to bring on more capacity, which includes additional investments from 3M and partnerships with governments at all levels. In total, last year, we produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are at an annual run rate of 2.5 billion respirators, a fourfold increase versus 2019. At the same time, we've worked closely with governments, law enforcement and retailers to fight fraud. To date, we have helped identify more than 8 million counterfeit respirators, protecting health care workers from bad actors. Beyond providing respirators and other important personal protective equipment, we have helped the world recover in other ways. For example, our biopharma filtration solutions have enabled the development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We also took significant actions throughout the year to position ourselves for long-term growth and value creation. We continue to strengthen our innovation which remains at the center of our 3Mmodel. And last year, we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and CapEx. Our team also found ways to innovate differently and faster in response to the pandemic. And to serve growing market trends. We formed partnerships with other companies to expand respirator production. We introduced new daily face coverings, and we quickly adapted our cleaning product lines to serve new customers. We created new products to improve indoor air quality, biopharma filtration, and automotive electrification, just a few of our priority growth platforms. We rolled out cutting edge solutions to improve the performance of electric car batteries. One element of our work to enable more sustainable vehicle designs. For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7% outperforming the markets they serve. We also continue to see benefits from the global operating model we implemented last January. Our model enabled us to respond to the pandemic, with agility and resilience from our significant expansion of PPE production to our ability to maintain business continuity, serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Our enterprise operations team is applying learnings from our expansion of respirator production into other areas of 3M. For example, we are deploying new technology and using our analytic platforms to double our Filtrete capacity. We also took steps to optimize our model and further streamline our organization initiating a restructuring in December that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 million to $300 million. In summary, as I look across 2020, I am proud of our accomplishments and our people from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories, to our colleagues who volunteered to relocate and help scale up new respirator lines. To the retirees who came back to staff our hotline answering calls from home, people across 3M have stepped up to make a difference. And I thank our entire team for their incredible contributions in 2020. Please turn to Slide 12. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2021 with organic growth of 3% to 6%; improved earnings, margin expansion and strong cash flow, and Monish will take you through the details shortly. We have aggressively prioritized investments throughout the pandemic, and we will accelerate our efforts in 2021. With ongoing focus on growth, productivity, and sustainability, we will increase investments in areas with strong growth opportunities such as personal safety, home improvement, and health care, with continued emphasis on our priority growth platforms. The rapid movement to an even more digital first world also opens additional opportunities for 3M. We are pioneering innovations that improve performance of data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing, which will be more relevant moving forward. We will also do more to leverage e-commerce along with digital technologies to better serve our customers. Ultimately, we have big opportunities to unleash 3M science and drive sustainable, long-term growth. And we will ensure that our teams have the resources to capitalize. We continue to advance the digitization of 3M, while also accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. Further strengthening our supply chain is a priority in 2021. With a focus on highly sustainable, disruptive, and safe manufacturing technology, which will help us deliver on our promises to customers and shareholders. To that end, I want to close by talking about the commitments we will keep in 2021 and beyond leading our industry in science, society and sustainability. 3M science drives our business forward; we leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across the company, creating new products and new lines of business. And we are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated value for our customers into the future. In a similar way, 3M is partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020, we took steps to advance our core values, including diversity, equity and inclusion. And in the coming year, we will hold ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on our recent progress. We will also be releasing a new Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report with details on our metrics. We remain committed to sustainability, which includes using science to proactively manage PFS, and to enable success in our ongoing work with communities and governments to advance our environmental stewardship. We will continue to increase investments to make our factories more sustainable, including $100 million in investments this year, which is included in our 2021 CapEx guidance to further reduce water usage and improve water quality around our manufacturing sites. To help address questions you have been asking, I would also like to touch on our strong history of working with governments and leveraging science to solve big challenges around the world. We have had productive conversations with President Biden's transition team and now the administration about their COVID-19 response. And we have open lines of communication. We will continue to do all we can to get respirators and other personal protective equipment to frontline workers and help America in the world beat the pandemic. On environmental stewardship, we share a common goal with governments of improving water quality, and doing so in a way that is based on sound science, established regulatory processes and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders. We look forward to working with President Biden's administration and congressional leaders to pursue these shared goals, including through the remediation of PFAS where appropriate. And we aim to build on the successful public private partnerships that 3M has led globally throughout our history as a company. To wrap up, we are confident about what's ahead in 2021 and in our ability to create more value from the 3M model and build an even more competitive and sustainable enterprise. I will now turn the call over to Monish to cover the details of our guidance. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Mike, please turn to Slide 13. As Mike mentioned, we are initiating full year 2021 guidance as end market visibility has continued to improve despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales updates as we had in 2020. Looking at sales; we are forecasting total sales growth of 5% to 8% with organic growth in the range of 3% to 6%. Earnings per share is projected to be between $9.20 and $9.70, or up 5% to 11% on an adjusted basis. The primary contributors to earnings growth in 2021 include organic sales growth, productivity as we continue to increase our focus on operating rigor through daily management and leveraging the use of data and data analytics, and our ongoing efforts to advance and streamline our global operating model. And lastly, we anticipate benefits from foreign currency due to the weaker US dollar. Partially offsetting these benefits are anticipated year-on-year headwinds from the Q4 2020 gain on sale of real estate and expected increase in areas such as travel, variable incentive compensation and advertising and merchandising investments. Turning to cash, we expect another year of robust cash flow, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority remains investing organically in our business, including R&D and CapEx. As we have noted, we are increasing investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in 2021. As a result, CapEx for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Returning cash to shareholders remains a high priority for 3M including both dividends, along with a disciplined approach to share repurchases, which we plan to restart in 2021. Please see the appendix in today's slide presentation for additional details regarding our 2021 full year guidance. Please turn to Slide 14. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group along with some of the key macroeconomic and market indicators we incorporated into our planning. Overall, the pace and success of the COVID-19 vaccine deployment and adoption will be critical for the global economy. The two broadest macroeconomic indicators, Global GDP and IPI are both expected to grow mid-single digits. The overall electronics market is expected to be up mid-single digits. In addition, global car and light truck builds are expected to grow 14% versus 2020. Also, while health care and oral care elective procedure volumes have improved off the Q2 lows of 2020. They are currently not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the later part of 2021. We are also monitoring the ability and pace for people to return to the workplace and students to return to school. And finally, consumer spending, particularly retail sales and home improvement demand, and e-commerce also are factors in our planning. Taking these factors into account, we expect the following organic growth expectations for our business groups in 2021. Starting with safety and industrial, where we anticipate organic local currency growth to be up mid-single digits, transportation and electronics is expected to be up low to high single digits. This vital range contemplates the potential for end market variability, particularly in automotive and electronics. And finally, both our health care and consumer businesses are projected to grow in the low to mid-single digits this year. In 2021, we will prioritize capital to our greatest market opportunities. Deliver for our customers, drive commercial intensity, improve operating rigor, enhance daily management, leverage data and data analytics and continue to streamline our organization. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth; improve margins and earnings, robust free cash flow and a continued strong capital structure and financial flexibility. To wrap up; in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do and will do. I would like to thank all 3Mers for the hard work and the progress that we have made in an unprecedented year. With that, I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hey, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, it's nice to see you guys back in the guidance business. But I have to admit I'm going to miss those monthly sales updates. First question for Monish. Can you comment on the \u2013 how the company has been benefiting from lowered temporary cost, no travel or less travel trade shows and so forth? And for 2021, what assumptions are you making about how do these temporary costs start to get feathered back in? Monish Patolawala : Yes, so I would just say, Dean, thanks for the question. And as you know, we've done a great job as a team trying to keep up costs under control. You can see that in Q3 results. You can see that in Q4. How it will bounce back will actually all depend on where we see the recovery of the pandemic and how the vaccine plays itself out. Currently, as you can see from the guidance that we've given you, there is headwind that we're planning on the bounce back of $0.35 to $0.45 that was put in there. And there are two or three things in there, Dean. One is, as you think about the property sales that are year-over-year, that are non-repeat. Secondly, all these indirect costs, travel is a big piece of that that comes back. And the third one is the variable compensation that gets reset for 2021. And from 4Q to 1Q, also there will be a reset and an increase in cost. So those are the factors we're looking at. And I would just say from a quarter perspective, it's all going to depend on our how revenue comes across, how growth happens, how the economy recovers. The other piece, just to keep in mind, as Mike mentioned, our plan is to invest more in opportunities on growth, productivity and sustainability. And that also will have an impact on each quarter, depending on how the economy recovers. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, and just broadly, I really appreciate all the work that 3M has done with regard to wrapping up the respirator mask capacity and how you've responded, that's been terrific. Just want to express my appreciation. Can you comment on any updates on the MIT collaboration and the rapid test system that you have in development? Mike Roman : Yes. Sure, Dean, thanks for that question. Our team has been working with MIT researchers, as we've talked about, really focused on developing a low-cost rapid detection capability for COVID-19. And over the past nine months, we've made some very significant technical advances in the design. And we're bringing our expertise in manufacturing and scaling up working with MIT with their capabilities and technology around the assay, the measurement development. And we've been focused on some of the challenges that are inherent in this kind of development, which is the stability of the tests and the robustness of the device, and improving sensibility, sensitivity in the detection. And we're in the middle of the development phase. We're working to address those challenges. We've made very good progress. We'll continue to update as we go along and we're continuing to be very, very encouraged by the partnership with MIT. Deane Dray : What would be the optimistic view on a rollout? Mike Roman : Well, we're in development. We\u2019ve got to resolve some of the requirements that are here around sensitivity and stability of the device. So we're in the middle of that. Well, as soon as we get further along, I would say, in the development phase, we will give you a better view of timelines. Deane Dray : Appreciate it. Best of luck to everyone. Mike Roman : Thanks, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Thank y ou. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Mike Roman : Hey, Scott. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I want to just dig in on the T&E guide a little bit. I mean, it's a kind of drive a truck through that low to high range. And when I look at it at least and based on what we've seen this quarter, it seems like the bias could be a little bit more to the higher side of that. Is there something that concerns you? Perhaps maybe emerging market recovery or something like that that concerns you that make you a little bit more conservative on that specific segment? Mike Roman : Well, Scott, I'll start with something Monish said, it's great to see this business turn positive in Q4. It's a very good business that faces into markets that have very innovative customers and segments. And it's a good opportunity for us to continue to grow and leverage our innovation. As we look into 2021, we see some positive outlooks. We saw and highlighted some of the strength in semiconductor and in automotive build rates turning positive in Q4, that's expected to continue to get better in 2021. I would say there's - we start with - there's some uncertainty on how that's going to play out as we start the year. COVID is still the driving factor here, what is the visibility through that. I think we get better clarity on the plans of our customers and how they're thinking about it. There's still that uncertainty around the pandemic and how that plays out even in those areas. You see some of that, and I'll look of maybe some softness in consumer electronics, as we start the year. We also - as a reminder in this business, we have exposure to oil and gas and highway infrastructure and commercial solutions, which really depends on people in the office working in the office and in commercial settings. So there's a balance across those businesses with the view of the uncertainty in how the pandemic is going to play out and we'll get better clarity as we go through the year. Monish Patolawala : I would just add Scott to everything Mike said. I would just add the supply chain stability in the electronics and the auto OEM market, also something that we are watching. So as that plays out and that gets more stable, I think it'd give us more stability and certainty on how we're going to deliver against it. Scott Davis : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean are there any tangible PFAS milestones in 2021 that you guys can remind us of? Mike Roman : Well, Scott, we've continue to... Scott Davis : Anything at all where we can get some more color? Mike Roman : Yes, I would say, for us, we continue to focus on proactively managing PFAS. And that we've got three principles, and one of those is providing transparency to you and our investors. And right now, there had been scheduled some initial bellwether case in Michigan that's been postponed, it's still to be determined when that'll be scheduled. So we'll update as we go. We do continue to keep our 3m.com site updated with all recent PFAS information. And we'll continue to update on whether it's litigation, our work or our work in support of regulatory standards. Any of those categories we will update there and we\u2019ll update in these calls as well. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Mike Roman : Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question, Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Mike Roman : Hey, Joe. Monish Patolawala : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, maybe my first question, just trying to understand, obviously, great ending to the year from an organic growth standpoint. I'm trying to understand, I guess, like, what's embedded from a cadence perspective, as we progress through 2021? And then secondly, is it - there was some pandemic-related benefits that you received in 2020? I'm just wondering what your base case expectation is for 2021? Is there - is it a headwind? Is it neutral, just trying to understand that better? Monish Patolawala : So I'll try again, Joe, I think you're asking what our cadence is and how we're going to look at 2021. So what we're going to, we're going to be as helpful as we can, as you know, Joe, we have initiated annual guidance, and based on where we see some of the end markets that I mentioned about in my prepared remarks. Based on that we'll see where - how those end markets play out that will determine how our quarterly things play out. Our guidance is right now organic 3% to 6% with 5% to 8% growth in total, including FX. One of the things that we have seen over the pandemic, Joe, is our normal trends that historically you would see don't seem to play itself out. So for example, in December, the company usually sees deceleration we didn't see the deceleration. Similarly, on a month-to-month trend, sometimes what you see in variability in the months was higher due to COVID and therefore, my personal belief is I think you're going to see more variability throughout the year depending how different parts of the world play itself out. We are also aggressively prioritizing our investments throughout on all the three items Mike mentioned growth, productivity and sustainability. Again, that will have an impact based on how revenue plays itself out. We would love to go heavy and invest early so that we can capture the growth that's coming. But we'll have to see how the world recovers. So we'll have to just walk through that. And then just another piece for you to keep in mind, as you're thinking about the quarters is from a restructuring charge perspective, we had announced the charge in the fourth quarter, you're going to see the balance of that charge somewhere between $110 million to $160 million in the second half of this year. And we'll tighten that as we go through the quarter. So our goal is to be as helpful as we can, throughout and through the various interactions we have with all of you is to tell you what's going on in the world. But that's the way we see it right now. So hopefully I answered your question, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Yes, Monish, that's helpful, and maybe just my follow-on question, since you mentioned the restructuring, you did announce the call it $75 million to $100 million in benefits, that we're going to impact 2021. I guess how do we think about that in the context of some of the temporary cost actions that are reversing fully recognizing that the investments that you've just laid out, are likely going to be dependent on how the volume shakeout? Mike Roman : Yes, it's a great one, Joe. And the same thing we keep thinking about all the time of how do we do it. So we have tried on our, on one of the presentation pages, there's a guide out there, where we show you headwinds is $0.35 to $0.45, and the benefit from restructuring is anywhere between $0.20 to $0.30. If you think about the headwinds, as I mentioned before, there's property sales that don't repeat some of the indirect costs that was snapped back. Example, travel and variable compensation is in that range of $0.35 to $0.45. And then on the restructuring side, the $0.20 to $0.30, I would ask you to think about two pieces. One is for all the other actions that the companies had taken other than the fourth quarter, there's a carryover benefit of give or take $100 million. And then the benefits of the restructuring that we announced in the fourth quarter are another $75 million of benefits $75 million to $100 million. And then, of course, it's offset by the charge that we're going to take a $110 million to $160 million. So that's why we have called out the restructuring benefits in the guide of $0.20 to $0.30. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe, hey, maybe just the first question on just the firm wide adjusted sort of operating margin expansion for 2021 that's dialed in. So I see all those moving parts on Slide 21, which is very helpful. So maybe thinking about it just differently from a sort of P&L standpoint, I think your adjusted EBIT margin in 2020 was around sort of between 21% and 21.5% maybe, if you could just confirm that. And then of that base, what level of margin expansion you dialing in for 3M in 2021 at the midpoint of the guidance, let's say. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Julian. I would say a couple of things. So first, just answer your question to give you the 20% to 21.5%. That's correct. So it's 21, 3 is the perfect number. If you think about 2021 ad how we look at margin, I'll just elevate first to say our general view over the long term is growth at or about macro, sustainable margin improvement; strong cash that ultimately helps us have a very strong capital structure. So keeping that in mind, we would say that's basically how we are thinking about long term, things to factor in from a margin guide perspective, as Mike mentioned, we are going to invest properly in growth, productivity and sustainability. So that's going to have one factor. The second factor is going to be the amount of productivity that we are generating. We've got a lot of proprietary technologies that we are rolling out in supply chain. Mike mentioned that the stability of our supply chain is one of our priorities for 2021. We're going to continue that path. So you should see benefit from the productivity actions that the supply chain team is driving. The third piece is making sure that we have factored in correctly the snap back of 2020 costs. We have shown you that it's $0.35 to $0.45 of headwind again on the three items that I mentioned before, and I would say the last one to think about this is thinking about what revenue is going to be and what growth looks like quarter-to-quarter. And that's going to also have a pretty big impact on where we end up from a margin perspective. So those are all the factors that we are putting in here as we think about but long-term growth at or about macro, sustainable margin improvements, and then strong cash. Julian Mitchell : I see. So, Monish, is around the sort of plus 30, 40 basis points margin expansion is that the rough ballpark then putting in all of those different pieces. Monish Patolawala : So I go back again, Julian, I would say it all depends on where revenue ends up being and where - how much we invest. So it all depends on how fast the world recovers. Julian Mitchell : Fair enough. And then just the second topic quickly, you'd alluded in the prepared remarks to the buyback perhaps resuming clearly the balance sheet starting to look under levered and very good free cash flow last year. You're not dialing in much in the way of share count reduction on that Slide 21. So maybe help us understand what scale of buybacks you might be contemplating for the year? Monish Patolawala : Sure. The way that we look at it, Julian, is our first step in all of this is to make sure that we are investing organically R&D and CapEx, you're seeing us increase capital expenditure at $1.8 billion to $2 billion because we see some growth opportunities, some productivity opportunities, as well as sustainability. Our second priority is dividends and making sure that our shareholders think that's important. We acknowledge that our third priority is M&A. And then our last priority share buyback. So we as I said in my prepared remarks at 3M, we understand returning cash to shareholders is important. So we have both, we're going to dividend as well, as we have always supported a reasonable amount of share buyback. And that's our current plan. How much and how that plays out from a timing perspective is again goes back to where we see where the economic recovery is going to look like. And then based on that we'll work it with the board, and we'll keep y'all posted as we announced. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Hi, I just wanted to go back to the increase investments comments. So just go into your 2021 EPS Bridge; the $0.47 of organic growth, I think that kind of recap, and it's down to like a sub 30% of in gross margin. So it feels like this investment spending gains that. Just want to confirm that. And are we thinking about R&D to kind of get back to that 5.5% - 6% of sales kind of range in 2021? Mike Roman : Is a question, Nigel, are we getting back to 5.5% to 6% of sales R&D? Is that the question? Nigel Coe : That's part and then would that investment spent be against your organic growth bucket? Monish Patolawala : Yes, so I would say, listen, R&D right now is I would say is in that range. But it always goes back to the point Mike made, which is our plan is to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. On the growth side, we have so many good opportunities, whether it's home care, personal safety, digital, health care, data analytics, as well as auto OEM. From an electrification perspective, we have tremendous opportunities of growth. And depending on how we see 2021, and then 2022 and beyond play out, we won't be shy to invest in those areas, we won't be shy to invest in advertising and merchandising too as required in our businesses to make sure that we capture for the long-term growth. So I would say that yes, but I would also ask us to start thinking to be four great businesses and depending on how the end markets play out in those four businesses, we're going to flex up or down. So I don't know if I answered your question, Nigel, but that's the way I look at it from an R&D perspective. Nigel Coe : Yes, I think so. I think that's good answer. And then on the pricing side, obviously, we saw a pickup in pricing, especially in T&E, I think, EMEA is [Indiscernible] in the quarter. You talked about reduced discounting activity because of COVID which makes a lot of sense. I'm just wondering if we can just talk about raw pricing. So are you increasing pricing responds to the raw material inflation and maybe just a little bit color around that will be helpful? Monish Patolawala : Sure. So we are seeing inflation. One of the things about 3M is we buy so many diverse products, there's not one product that's greater than $200 million to $300 million that's - that has a big impact. But we are seeing I would say inflation in three areas. Area number one is just raw material and feed. Couple of them we look at is polypropylene, wood pulp, ethylenes are areas that we look at and say all of them are showing inflation. The second is as you're seeing also from different industrials is logistics cost is higher, whether it's air or truck, the logistics costs are higher. So we're seeing inflation there. And the third piece even though the economies still are not that very strong from a labor shortage perspective, that's another area where we're seeing inflation and manpower cost. So those are the three areas that we are seeing, we have a great sourcing team that's working to minimize that as much as they can. And then also your specific question on pricing. Our aim is to have prices that will go up on a year-over-year to take into account the inflation that we're seeing. Operator : Our next line comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. I had just sort of a softer question. I think 3M is going through a period where there are a lot of changes happening below the surface, which are sort of less than apparent to us looking from the outside. But you have new systems; you have sort of this new structure where organization is much more globally focused. Can you just talk to us, as 2020 evolved how did it change your planning process? And how did it impact your planning process going into 2021? Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. We have even in the middle of the pandemic we've continued to make very good progress on some of what you outline there. And part of it is the digitization of 3M, transforming our company deploying new ERP and ecosystem around it that continues to move forward. We are also now operating for one year, our new operating model that we launched in January of 2020. And that we moved ahead in the middle of the pandemic, we benefited from it, we saw the benefits come in our ability to respond to just the dynamics that we hit. It's on our markets as we went through the year. So I would say we benefited from it, it validated where we are going with the 3M model, it validated the strengths of the 3M model and how we apply our innovation in our markets. And I would say it encouraged us to continue to really press ahead, and I talked about that in my prepared remarks about the digitization, improving our operations, I see it in terms of more agility, shorter cycle times, improved response. And ultimately, it's really at the foundation of how we drive productivity, operational improvements as we go. So that's becoming the way we take advantage of it. That's how we focus it. And so planning broadly, as part of that we're getting, I would say better in terms of cycle times. And I better at using the greater visibility on data and the analytics that go with it. So it's, I'm encouraged with the progress we've made. And I believe there's more to come as we go through 2021. Monish Patolawala : Andrew, I would just add, I've been here only six months. So just to tell you the changes that I've seen in the six months I've been here. There's a lot more focus on daily management, are we winning daily? Are we not winning daily, much more tie into what external market trends that we are seeing, so we can quickly react as needed? You can see the work the supply chain teams have done to keep our supply chain lines running despite supply chains in general being broken. I look at also the ability to see visibility of data. So there's data democratization, where we can see stuff that is happening much faster on a daily basis. So it's all about driving the operating rigor getting the daily management quickly going into root cause and then finding sustainable improvements. Here we're using, so I think there's much more transparency on issues that we are facing and the team is going in eyes wide open and trying to find solutions as quickly as we can. Andrew Obin : And just follow up question; you're sort of highlighted, like the procedure slow down. But if I look at medical solutions that were probably driven by Acelity I guess on oral care, you said it down organically, but I think reported number is still up. Can you just talk about where is organic growth for product lines like Acelity and Tegaderm and how do you expect them to sort of evolve into the second half of the year? Monish Patolawala : Sure. So Acelity I would say is one of the divisions that does get impacted, the highest due to hospitalization rate and elective surgeries but overall when you just step back and say what is Acelity done? I would say as the volumes came up in Q2, off Q2 lows the business has continued to grow tremendously through those Q2 lows, the reason why Acelity is so good for 3M, I think there are a couple of things. One is it's in a market that is ever growing right now based on where our demographics are. Secondly, it gives 3M a lot more relevance when it comes to talking to caregivers. Third is it gets us into a post-acute space and a home care space, which I think post-COVID is going to be a trend from a home care perspective. And then what 3M brings to Acelity is the synergies that it can bring one is its brand, its global reach, and its ability to do global and high-speed manufacturing. It brings it to that and 3M did already have an advanced wound care business. So when you put this together, it basically makes it a very good acquisition for 3M. We have seen growth in both. We have made positive income in third and fourth quarter. And we are very encouraged with all the work that the health care team is doing that this business will keep growing. But of course, it will be partially dependent on how the world recovers from electives. Andrew Obin : And is Tegaderm, are they comp positive or still negative? Bruce Jermeland : Andrew, I think we have to get back to you. Monish Patolawala : Unfortunately I don't have that handy. Sorry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning. I'm going to disagree with Dean for once and say I'm glad we're not getting the monthly sales. Just it's I'm in favor of less work, less work these days. Given the industry trends, that's negative productivity for us. On that side, that productivity bucket for you guys, the $0.20 to $0.35 for this year. Where did that end up for? I know this is kind of a messy bridge for 2020. But where did that number end up for 2020? Monish Patolawala : You are saying the full year 2020? Steve Tusa : Yes, the full year 2020 kind of productivity bucket. Monish Patolawala : So the leverage, I think if my memory is right was landed up somewhere. Again, it's so messy with all the indirect snap backs and in and out of 2020 and what we did by quarter-to-quarter timing, et cetera. But I would just say, Steve, in general, you should just think about the leverage range for 3M in the range of 30% to 40% from an incremental volume perspective. Steve Tusa : Okay, that's helpful. And then within the organic growth assumption, what are you assuming for price? Monish Patolawala : So as I said before on the earlier question that was there. We expect prices to be positive based on all the inflation that we are seeing. And historically, when you think about what 3M has been able to do, they have been able to get price just because of the value that they add to customers. And I don't expect that to change. Steve Tusa : So like 50 to 100 bps something in that range. Monish Patolawala : Well, historically 3M, if my memory is right and Bruce can correct me it has been in the range of 30 to 50 basis points excluding electronics, which electronics as you know an industry that definitely sees price decrease, but we'll have to see where inflation ends up here. And we'll do the best we can. Steve Tusa : Okay, and then one last one, just for maybe Mike. DuPont had some news around PFAS recently. Can you just kind of help put that in context? Is that kind of meaningless for you guys because you're on like a very different glide path with your exposures there? I don't know what kind of color you can provide is as far as helping frame that kind of read across to you guys. Mike Roman : Yes, Steve, and we did see their press release. And we won't comment on the agreement that they've announced. I would just reinforce what I've been saying is we are committed to proactively manage PFS, and the three principles are the way we think about this. Sound science and how can we apply that in our 3M expertise to move ahead. Our corporate responsibility and we're stepping into that with where we manufactured, historically manufactured and dispose the PFS and then transparency and keeping you and our investors updated on what we are seeing and how we progress. And that's something that we'll continue to focus on as we go through the year. So that's probably where I'll leave it for now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just a different way to ask this PFS question and also a follow on to the capital allocation question, but I think in response you said the economic recovery is what going to govern your expectations around the pace of share repurchases. I guess the follow-on question to that is, are any expectations around PFAS timing factoring into that? Or is it really about the economic recovery? Monish Patolawala : So I would say, John, we always take multiple factors into account as needed. Right now, one of the big factors is the pace of the core economy. But as things evolve, and things change, we'll definitely update you on our guidance. John Walsh : Okay and then maybe just a question for Mike. We've seen it from several others; obviously you're an integrated material science company. But could you talk about any potential pruning, as you look forward? And if that's a lever, that 3M still has available to pull? Mike Roman : Yes. And, John, you're talking about portfolio when you ask the question. Correct. John Walsh : Yes. Not like, obviously, your models integrated. But are there things still around the edges or maybe even a little bit chunkier in terms of pruning that you would consider? Mike Roman : Well, I would say we continue, and even through 2020, in the middle of COVID, we continue to actively manage our portfolio and we focus on three priorities, when we think about that. One is prioritizing where we invest organically, so the 5.5% to 6% on R&D is not everywhere the same, we are prioritizing where we're making investments, you'll see that in capital investments as well. So we use portfolio to dry that first and foremost, that's our priority in our capital allocation. Then we look at complimentary acquisitions. And Acelity as Monish talked earlier, that's a great example of that strategy. And we're focused on Acelity. We continue to be active and looking at M&A. We're focused on Acelity as we come into 2021. And then we do have a, I would say, a rigorous approach to optimizing value in each of our businesses. And this includes what we might do to change the model, or if there's a better owner or more value to be created, we would this would include divestitures, as we've done, as we did with our drug delivery business in 2020. So it's an ongoing process. We continue to assess it. When we see an opportunity to increase value, we'll take action as we have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Mike, you seem relatively confident in ongoing recovering and in the past, you've said that you don't really see the recovery as a restocking. So maybe give us some more color into where you think inventory is pulling both the channel and at 3M at this point. Mike Roman : Yes. Andy, I would say we're seeing what you're hearing and probably seeing more broadly, and that starts with the second half of 2020, where more I would say the channels across our various markets began to stabilize, as we went through the second half into the end of the year. And so if you look at our four go-to-market models, they each have a little different dynamic, the safety and industrial business. Our channel partners remained cautious there, you're seeing continued demand for us in safety and personal protective equipment. We saw some improvement in our industrial adhesives and tapes business as we went through Q4. Other businesses are still seeing end market declines. And so we're not seeing material restocking in those safety or industrial channels globally. Transportation, electronics, they're pretty much in balance with demand, there's some tight supply and Monish mentioned supply chain things that we're watching everybody's watching around semiconductor and that does relate to the strong demand in their end markets. Health care generally steady as the end markets have now adjusted to the changes in areas like elective procedures in the middle of COVID. There's Q4 we kind of saw a resurgence of COVID cases impact that but pretty steady as we come into the year. And consumer is I would say mixed, we see high demand in home improvement that continues. That's lower-than-normal levels in that channel. And we see really elevated levels still in office and retail as you seen the slowdown because of the work remotely kind of economy that we're in. So it's a little mixed, in general, we're not seeing a strong restocking as we come into the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful then a follow up would be on sort of respirator side. I might have missed this but I think you mentioned 350 basis points of tailwind in Q4. A little higher than you had guided; are you still increasing capacity in respirators and then these other areas that you've experienced pandemic tailwind? And then what kind of line of sight do you have as you - if you do - if you are increasing capacity, I mean, it seems like respirator demand can last well into 2022 at this point. Mike Roman : Andy, we did bring online in the US, we talked a lot about this as we went through the year, capital that we invested in and capital that we invested in a public private partnership with DOD. And that is all online, we did realize some improved productivity on those lines, we've been working even as we bring on new capital to drive greater throughputs and yields and rates and we had some improvement from that. We did, as we got through Q4 get to full capacity and full run rates. And so that's $2.5 billion run rate that I talked about, we're going to - we will continue to strive to improve on that as we go through the year. We are - we still see strong demand around the world where we will continue to do everything we can to meet that demand. And we're at like I said, at full capacity of the new lines. And we can, will incrementally add to that as we go through the year. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the first quarter if there's any color you guys can give. I know we've gone back to kind of the normal annual cadence. But given that things are still kind of crazy with respect to COVID. Not a ton of visibility, kind of the mix between what you're seeing on the industrial side versus PPE. Is there any way you can kind of frame for us? Either what you're seeing in January or thoughts around the organic outlook for the first quarter? Monish Patolawala : Sure, Nicole, it's a question that we keep asking ourselves and try to get as much visibility as we can. As you correctly stated, there's a lot of uncertainty right now in the world. As we saw end markets starting to stabilize, and our visibility got better, we started an annual guidance of 3% to 6%. And I think as the world recovers, we should be able to get there, we are confident that innovation that we are doing should help us get to solid growth and grow that are about macro in the long run. When you think about 1Q, one of the things that we have seen over the last six months that I've at least been here and longer for these teams are some of the historical trends have just not played themselves out. So December didn't slow down, as historically has been. With that said, I don't think January has started off very weak. But the things that we are watching are where does hospitalization go? What happens to elective procedures both in the hospital and the oral care space? So we're pretty cautious in that and seeing what we're seeing right now. On the industrial side, making sure that industrial activity continues, our customers continue to buy inventory will be the second piece that we got to watch. Third, as I've mentioned on the auto side, and on the electronic side, where both of them are starting to combine together, how does the supply chains play itself out and what the volume of auto production is going to be? And then the last one to think about is from a consumer perspective, we had an extremely strong consumer growth. You saw we grew nearly 10% with a very strong holiday season. The question is does that strength continue in retail when do schools reopen? Also, just a reminder, from a tactical basis, we are hitting that point where we start lapping year-over-year pandemic demand. So 3M had nearly $100 million of disposable respirator sales last year 1Q, 2020. Again driven by the pandemic so we are lapping that. And then on the income side to think through, Nicole, what is the volume going to look like? And I mentioned we're quite cautious on what we're seeing. And then just on the tactical side, what else we're going to invest, how fast we're going to invest in each of the quarters in the areas Mike mentioned. And then from a year - quarter-over-quarter sequential basis as we reset variable compensation for the first quarter as well as we start stepping into advertising merchandising investments, we will have an impact. So hopefully I gave you the things we are looking at Nicole as we're thinking about the quarter. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, that's perfect. And just one follow up the outlook for free cash flow. Can you guys just talk about what you see with respect to networking capital and the opportunity to reduce factory inventories 3M in 2021? Monish Patolawala : Yes, so I would say, Nicole, improving velocity working capital turnover, whichever terminology you want to use is one of our priorities. There is a good opportunity there. You've seen the team has done a really nice job from Q2 highs of where the inventory was as a percent of sales or even if you look at days on hand, to bring it down in Q3, and Q4. The work that the team is doing with data, data analytics, but also putting enterprise operations and supply chain together is an area that I would say is an opportunity for us in 2021 and beyond to keep improving inventory velocity. And we are committed to doing that and we'll keep driving that. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, in Q4 and throughout 2020, our team executed well and continue to fight the pandemic from every angle, while building for the future and advancing our values. As we look ahead, we will apply 3M science to capitalize on global market trends and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. We enter 2021 well positioned to generate greater value for our customers and shareholders and deliver a strong performance. Thank you for joining us.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, April 27, 2021. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer; along with John Banovetz, our Chief Technology Officer. John is joining us today to discuss our new sustainability goals which we introduced in February. Mike, Monish, and John will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming 2021 quarterly earnings conference calls which will be held on July 27 and October 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. And finally, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K dated March 22, 2021, 3M changed its accounting principle for pension and post-retirement plan cost and our measure of segment operating performance. The information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all time periods presented. Please turn to slide 4, and I'll now hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was strong for 3M with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow, and expanded margins along with a double digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and Winter Storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, roll-out of vaccines, and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty, and with one quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share, and cash flow. Our team remains focused on driving growth, improving operational performance, and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Please turn to slide 5. Company-wide total sales increased to $8.9 billion with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share up 27% year on year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific up 13% with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6% with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28% with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. While we manage end market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in healthcare, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advanced growing areas like automotive electrification and biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use, and improving water quality. In a similar way, we are implementing a long term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the Twin Cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19 with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity, and advancing sustainability. To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John. John? John Banovetz : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and please turn to slide 6. I'm proud to lead 3M's research and development and sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water, and waste. First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way : 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, and 100% by 2050. Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. We will continue to advance new state of the art technologies including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities, and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last two decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70% while doubling revenues. Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity, and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable; on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment, and over the last five years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our annual sustainability report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities. Please turn to slide 7, and I'll turn it over to Monish. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year on year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year on year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year on year. Turning to selling prices and raw materials, as Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing cost particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts on the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with Winter Storm Uri. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margin in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories, and ongoing demand planning given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. Moving to divestiture impacts, the lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year on year to earnings. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year on year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. Three other non-operating items impacted our year on year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year on year non-operating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net non-operating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income along with regional income mix and equity based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remain unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year on year which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year on year, with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position along with our strong cash flow generation capability continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to slide 9 where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which posted organic growth of 10.3% year on year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand. However, the year on year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparison. Overall, general Industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pick-up in growth across the portfolio. Personal Safety posted double digit organic growth year on year driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low-double digits primarily due to strong demand across Industrial and Electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing granules business which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses, Automotive Aftermarket grew high-single digits organically, the Electrical Markets business was up mid-single digits, and Abrasives grew low-single digits while our Closure and Masking business declined year on year. Safety and Industrials first quarter segment operating margin were 24.4% up 70 basis points year on year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics, and legal costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our Electronics-related business was up high-teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation, and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our Auto OEM business was up 21% year on year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. Turning to Advanced Materials, which increased mid-single digits largely as a result of the year on year increase in automotive builds and finally, our Transportation Safety business was flat year on year while Commercial Solutions declined slightly. Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margin were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year on year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior-year COVID-related asset write-downs which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. Turning to our Healthcare business, healthcare providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volume still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline healthcare workers which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Healthcare business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. The Medical Solutions business grew high-single digits driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low-single digits due to the ongoing year on year impact of low procedure volumes. Organic sales for our Oral Care business increased double digits year on year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. The Separation and Purification business increased low-teens year on year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutic development and manufacturing along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while Food Safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. Healthcare's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year on year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth which was partially offset by supply chain disruption and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year on year with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by the Home Improvement business, up double digits organically driven by strong demand for Command adhesives, Filtrete air quality solutions, and ScotchBlue painter's tape. Stationery and Office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits, with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes, as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our Home Care business was up low-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. Consumer's operating margins were 21.1%, or similar to last year, as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing costs for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing, and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. Please turn to slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021 given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with evolving impacts from COVID including respirator demand, healthcare elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns, and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in costs for raw materials and logistics and in some cases constrained availability. And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity, and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along with it being early in the year, we think it prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70, and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics cost for the full year. We are taking several actions including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year on year operating margin headwind of 75 basis points to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad based growth, strong operational execution, and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity, and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor, and enhancing daily management. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for letting me in here. Are you guys seeing any strange order patterns as far as like double ordering or any kind of panic inventory rebuild? Anything? I would imagine you would probably see it in Transportation and Electronics, perhaps equally in Transportation and Electronics of all the segments, but I'll just leave it at that. Anything on the ordering patterns that's unusual? Mike Roman : Scott, I would say we see certainly a pick-up in orders when we see markets recovering and improving, and Transportation and Electronics were strong end markets for us in Q1. I wouldn't say we see anything unusual there. It's what comes with a normal pick-up in the marketplace. When you look at it a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories, and I would say we see them very much in line with what you have written about in your reports, that we see the changes due to growth trends. Overall inventory in our Industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation Electronics with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage we're seeing some challenges there, and it's just responding with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Healthcare's pretty steady, reacting to the trends still. Elective procedures well below pre-pandemic levels, so that's impacting there. Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand in Home Improvement. We're seeing lower levels there. You see a little lower levels when you see the pick-up, but it's responding to the marketplace. Otherwise, I would say the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected. A little better than we expected in March which was really reflected in our broad based growth but otherwise nothing unusual. Scott Davis : That's helpful. And then just to clarify on the $0.30 to $0.50 supply chain raw material logistics, whatever issues, is that net of what you expect on price for the year? Or is there some opportunity to offset that full amount with price, you're just not certain yet of the magnitude? Monish Patolawala : Hey, Scott. That's a great question. $0.30 to $0.50 is just pure raw material logistics headwind. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are going after price increase, improving yields in our factories, as well as working with our supply chain partners to reduce the impact as much as we can. You can see in the first quarter we had 70 basis points of price increase, and as I've also said, it's going to take a little bit of time for these actions to gain traction. So we expect that the second half will be better than the first half on the price perspective. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Probably can be tons of price cost and other questions, but maybe since we have John on the line, if you don't mind, could I throw one at him? Just wondering if you could actually update us on kind of the size of the priority programs currently that were outlined for us when we were in Saint Paul, whenever that was. Seems like a lifetime ago. I think it was 2019. And anything you can tell us on the vitality rate of the portfolio overall? One of the things that I always try to put my finger on, it's always just a little bit difficult, is the flip side of the new product development, what's going on kind of end of life and commoditization at the low end. And so the effort to counter that, if you have any color there, that would be interesting also. John Banovetz : Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question. So maybe on the first part around our priority growth platforms and our PGPs or so, they're about 5% of the overall portfolio I would say and growing quite a bit I think, as Mike referenced. We've seen approximately about a 10% growth over the last quarter of those platforms, and they continue to grow. And as you know, they sit in high growth market spaces for us, so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. Second comment is kind of around the vitality of the MP value part of it. We've talked about MP value in the past. That's definitely an important metric for 3M without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us, the primary obviously being growth and our profitability for that. I'd say over the last few years, our MPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s if you take an average over the last five years or so, which is I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously COVID's had some of that impact on trends here in the near term as well as we've gone forward. And then kind of as you said the commoditization, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC? Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Was that MPVI a mid-20s kind of five-year number or three-year number? What time span? John Banovetz : It's about a five-year number. Jeff Sprague : Five-year number. Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I guess if there's a surprise this quarter it's that despite having a solid operating beat you're leaving guidance unchanged. And Monish walked through all the list of headwinds and sized all of them or at least framed them with the exception of the last item about potential legal costs. Could you just either size for us or frame for us what the expectation might be this quarter either in terms of remediation costs or product liability? Because you're certainly signaling that something could be brewing here. Thanks. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Deane. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think some of this -- I'll just start first with all the headwinds that I've mentioned. At the same time, all the other actions that we are also taking to continue to drive operating rigor, whether it's raising price, driving operating rigor, and continued strong cash flow. So I'll keep all that first with the headwinds, with some partial offsets that will take a little bit of time to implement. As it regards legal cost you can see this more as we file our Q this morning, but there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter, and then the mask respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is, as we prepare for some of these trials, for example the Combat Arms trial that's also on in Florida right now, with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year. Deane Dray : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as a second question, it is interesting we're talking about a -- it's going to be tepid, but the back-to-school, return-to-office is outside of the seasonality. But it is encouraging. Can you frame for us expectations in terms of how much that might contribute in the second quarter? Monish Patolawala : Yeah, Deane. What we talked about is we did see a return to growth in our Stationery and Office business in first quarter, up mid-single digits, as Monish mentioned. That is the first indication that we're seeing pick-up from return to school and return to the workplace to a degree. It's one of those areas where we're looking at the uncertainties related to COVID, how will it play out. How big a return to school? How big a return to the workplace? And when? That will end up being what drives the answer to your question. So I would say good signs that we saw the pick-up in Q1 back to we expect economy to strengthen, and we're encouraged by the vaccines. We're going to have to wait to see how the return to the workplace and school plays out though. Deane Dray : Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, guys? Some of the constraints you've seen in the supply chain, [Indiscernible] et cetera, normally you see 2Q seasonally higher than 1Q. I'm wondering if the combination of [Indiscernible] production, et cetera, might limit the ability to see that normal seasonal ramp [Indiscernible] right now to 2Q seasonality. Monish Patolawala : Nigel, you were breaking up a little but I think your question was around Q2 seasonality, correct? Is that the question? Nigel Coe : Right. Exactly. Yes. Monish Patolawala : So I'll just start with my three quarters that I've been here in the pandemic that we've seen. I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been, compared to monthly cyclicality as well as compared to quarterly cyclicality, so I'll just start with that as the first piece. The second I would say is one thing you can definitely count on us in Q2 is strong execution. We are also confident that end markets are going to pick up, but I think they're going to be uneven. And for the second quarter we're still monitoring quite a few things, one of course Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery. How does that return to work come in? The return to work impacts not just the Stationery business, but it impacts our Graphics business. It impacts our Signage business and what happens there. And what people spend I think is going to be important to watch. The second piece is as the pandemic is playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. When you think about supply chain disruption, one is of course raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one of course is product availability and making sure there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keeps us manufacturing. Now, I'll tell you this, that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers thanks to the relationship they have with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. We are also raising prices, but it's going to take little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 basis points to 125 basis points of headwind which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned, we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020. We told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we've got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge. The balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. If this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect cost, travel cost, some of the legal costs we talked about will keep going up. Any other one-time headwinds will also go up as it regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run we want to keep investing in growth productivity and sustainability and put all that into play. That's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. Also, to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these things in play. Nigel Coe : Right. Thanks Monish, that's great color. My follow-up question is really just going back to the guidance and I understand all of the uncertainties you just laid out very, very clearly. But seems like the pension change in the way you account for the assets, seems like that's about a $0.20 year-over-year benefit to FY 2020. Was that change in the original guidance range, or was that additive to the [Indiscernible] guidance? Monish Patolawala : Nigel, I would say, as we have stated, we have restated all the years that are presented. So the year-over-year impact of that is approximately $0.11. So that's to answer your specific question on pension. The offsets to that, a couple of things. We took the opportunity to go redeem $450 million of debt that was due in 2022. That had an impact of $0.02 on interest for the quarter. And then as share prices have gone up, even though we have done share buyback of $231 million or share repurchase, our dilution has gone up, and that impacted $0.02 for the quarter. The total impact for other financials we had originally in our guide was zero. Right now, we are saying it's plus $0.05, to be clear. Nigel Coe : Great color. Thanks very much, Monish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Just following up on I think the last couple questions here, just sequentially you guys are usually up 1Q to 2Q, and I think you mentioned a whole host of items that kind of break the normal seasonality. Can you maybe just give us like a total number that you see from 1Q to 2Q that would be the mechanical impacts including the raws and the inflation? That's fine. Just all-in what the headwinds are from 1Q to 2Q? So we can just kind of like -- 1Q is obviously like a big upside, but then 2Q is going to be seasonally weak. So just trying to kind of figure out in total where we should kind of start from mechanically. Monish Patolawala : That's a great question, Steve. Just same comments that I made before. As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get. The amount of volume is going to depend on a lot of the uncertainties that I've talked about, whether it's elective procedures, whether it is semiconductor chip availability for Auto and Consumer, whether it is the strength in Stationery remains, whether the oil and gas industry picks up. So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing. We'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are two pieces. One is of course the inflation that we've told you about which will cost 75 basis points to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics cost as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have. So that's the other, I would say, headwind to 1Q. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about that headwind sequentially? What that headwind would be? What you've already kind of absorbed in first quarter, and what it is sequentially? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So a piece of it got absorbed in the first quarter, Steve. I think we'll have to see how April plays itself out, and May. As we look at product availability, making sure that our suppliers continue to be able to provide all the goods over the quarter is something that we're working on. Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they're also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We have done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully ad merch and travel start to go up. That's a headwind to Q1. As we are starting to see the economies starting to pick up, our investments in growth productivity and sustainability will continue to increase, so that's how I would frame Q1 versus Q2. Steve Tusa : Okay. Just it just seems to me like the biggest piece again is this kind of raw material issue, but some of that you absorbed in the first quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, it looks like that's like, I don't know, $0.15 to $0.20 year-over-year? Monish Patolawala : It's a 75 basis points to 125 basis points headwind. Steve Tusa : All right. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to focus perhaps on Safety and Industrial. The headline organic growth there was slightly lower in Q1 than Q4 even with the improving economy. And that's really that respirator tailwind for your 400 basis points less in Q1 than Q4. So just wanted to understand, what does the guidance for that segment and/or 3M in aggregate reflect for the respirator tailwind over the balance of this year? We've seen some write-downs at certain distributors and so forth for that kind of activity after over-ordering last year. Do you assume that that could become a headwind later this year, or the headwind really comes in 2022? Mike Roman : Julian, thanks for the question. We talked about Q1. We continue to see strong demand that 630 million respirators delivered in Q1. And still in the quarter, 90% going to healthcare workers and I would say first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in healthcare, and that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out and I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changings in protocols in use of respirators, for example, as one of those dynamics. As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties. There's that demand. And we're working on governments all over the world around stockpile strategies and continuing to supply into those. And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in Industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority more than 90% into Healthcare shifting more into Industrial and Consumer. And then the demand overall, how much is it going to be relative to the impact on the overall enterprise relative to SIBG? That's going to depend on how each of those play out. But we're expecting to continue to see demand in Industrial and Consumer and Healthcare as we go through the year. Monish Patolawala : To answer specifically your other question, Julian -- I'm sorry -- on why is the growth rate slowing down, we are starting to lap. So if my memory is right, Q1 of 2020 there was $100 million of disposable respirators that the company had disclosed even before my time. You're going to see actually the amount, if you're looking at the percent, it's going to slow down, as I said in my prepared remarks, because you're starting to lap the pandemic-related respirator demand year on year. John Banovetz : Julian, we disclosed all that last year as we went through the year. So Q2, it's a $225 million year on year comp. So we step from $100 million to [$200 million in a quarter] (ph), then $235 million in Q3. And I think in Q4 we were around $280 million. Last year. So the year on year contribution of growth is going to decline. Julian Mitchell : Yes. Understood. Thank you very much. And maybe just my second question around the capital deployment aspect. Cash flows been very, very good yet again leverage I think is now around 1.4 times. Any updated thoughts around the balance sheet usage? Or do we think that just given sort of the background leverage is likely to remain fairly low through the rest of the year? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. It's a great question, Julian. I would go back again to just our capital priorities. Prioritization hasn't changed. Our first priority is always invest in R&D. Mike mentioned the areas that we have as we think about just a few, and even John talked about whether it's Biopharma, Home Improvement, Personal Safety, Digital, Semiconductor, Healthcare they're tremendous opportunities that we believe we can keep investing in. So that's our first priority is I think in the long run that will give us the best return. The second priority is dividends. We did increase dividends 1% this year. It's the 63rd year of consecutive dividend increase. Our third priority is M&A. As you know, we are busy integrating Acelity. It's doing very well and integrating well into 3M. We don't see another acquisition in the size of Acelity in the near future, but we are always looking for opportunities where we believe it's complementary to 3M's strength as well as 3M can add value and synergies. And then our last priority is share repurchase. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have $231 million of share repurchases. I think the strength that we have right now, Julian, of 1.4 net leverage gives us a lot of flexibility to go either way as well as gives us strategic opportunities to deploy when needed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. So Transportation and Electronics as you know had a very high range of outcomes for the year, low to high-single digits. And obviously starting out at the high end of the range, is there any reason at this point why you wouldn't see the high end of the range in that particular segment given the comps do get a fair amount easier for the next couple quarters? Maybe just could give us more color on how Electronics and Auto really performed versus your expectations? I know you said absolutely that seems like they continue to be strong or even improve despite supply chain concerns. Mike Roman : It's an important question for us too, Andy. We had that wider range at the beginning of the year which really reflected the dynamics in those end markets, the uncertainty we were looking at as we came into the year. And we certainly had a good start to the year. Transportation and Electronics off to a strong start, much like the rest of the company. They're still facing some considerable uncertainties in that marketplace, and we talked about the chip shortage and its impact on both Electronics and Automotive. I think you see kind of changing dynamics in the build rates, much of it reflecting that dynamic. Electronics, I would say Consumer Electronics is off to a strong start. Tablets and TVs really driving a lot of that. So it's how are these trends going to play out through the year? And it still reflects I would say a wider range of outcomes. And it also is going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. Some of these are dynamics being driven by the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. I would say that wide range that we came into the year, we still have a wide range view of how the uncertainties will impact these key market segments. But again, off to a strong start. Automotive above the build rates of our growth and Consumer Electronics above the build rates there. So we're winning in the marketplace with our solutions, and we're well positioned. We'll see how the market dynamics take us as we go through the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, wanted to ask you about your priority growth platforms in the context of -- obviously there was strong growth in the quarter, I think 10%. There's a lot of money out there, whether it's the new Biden American Jobs Plan, focus on automotive electrification continues to increase. How do you sort of change your focus if at all on some of these platforms? Do you shift more money into something like automotive electrification? Do you see more growth in certain areas like that moving forward? Mike Roman : Andy, we talked about it all year last year about what we were doing to invest in the future while we were managing through the big challenges that the pandemic threw at us in 2020. And we are accelerating, I would say, investments not only in our priority growth platforms but other market trends that we were seeing that were opportunities for us, and we talked about things that were going on obviously in Personal Safety but also Home Improvement and other areas that trends were strong. So that's how we're prioritizing growth based on the market trends, where we can create unique and differentiated value. Priority growth platforms tend to represent both of those, strong markets, as John mentioned earlier. These are higher growth market segments. And then we have the investments that we make in the trends coming out of the pandemic, and we're stepping those up as we see the opportunity. So we're really driving those based on the growth opportunity that we see in front of us as we go through 2021, not locked in on a plan that we put together for our priority growth platforms before the year started. So it is what we see as an opportunity to drive the growth and the growth outlook that we had for the year as we came into 2021. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. I can reassure you that this will be one Consumer stocking up on 3M masks because we have to deal with inferior, inferior Kimberly-Clark product. So I just want to tell you that. Having said that, just the dynamic in the Americas on Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics in the quarter, I think you guys gave very useful breakdown. Just broader dynamic by sub end market, but in America, Safety and Industrial is up 12%. I assume it's because of Safety. But Transportation and Electronics down 4%. One is more OE, one is more channel. Can you just talk about this dynamic? What's happening? I think it does sound there's some pre-stock in OE, but what's happening in the distribution channel? Mike Roman : Yeah. Andrew, you're right. Safety and Industrial business [Indiscernible] in the performance in Americas, a big portion is driven by Personal Safety. It's been a strong growth driver. We talked about it. Monish highlighted some of the other Industrial businesses. We're seeing recovery in the Industrial markets in general. We're seeing increasing demand in industrial adhesives and tapes and industrial mineral products in the U.S. with the strong residential housing growth. All of those are driving what's going on in the Americas across Safety and Industrial business group. Transportation and Electronics, it's driven globally, the strong growth that you saw, by semiconductor fabrication, data centers, what I talked about earlier in Consumer Electronics. Those are not the big drivers obviously in the U.S. at this point. The automotive is the driver in the U.S., and I would say we're seeing good performance on our spec-ins. We're winning additional spec-ins in the OEMs. And as the build rates pick up in the U.S., we'll see TEBG, Transportation business from the automotive side get a strong contribution. Monish talked about some of the areas of uncertainties and things that we're looking at. Commercial solutions and the demand for graphics that are part of that, transportation safety products. Those are still flat year-over-year growth, even in decline in key end market segments, and that's one of the things that is an uncertainty as we look at the year. How are those markets going to recover as economies recover? So that will be part of the answer to Transportation and Electronics picking up as we go in the Americas in particular. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question I think Andy touched a little bit on it. But it seems that we have plenty of visibility on semiconductor CapEx going up in the U.S. over the next several years. Given the semi capacity on the margin over the past decade has been added outside of North America, do you need to make any adjustments to your manufacturing footprint in North America to sort of play this growth? Or is it just nature of your process and fungible capacity and just supplies better overall capacity utilization in North America given the assets you already have in place? Mike Roman : Yeah, Andrew. As you know, our strategy is to be close to customers, invest in capacity to meet the demands regionally around the world, and that's true broadly across the enterprise. There are some key product and market segments where we have more of a critical center in key areas of the world. U.S. is one of those areas where in the end we're a net exporter of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here, and that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to the end users, close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed. So we'll have time to adjust and add capacity, but we start in a good place relative to that market segment. Andrew Obin : Thank you for your answer. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. Hey. So a lot of details already around the logistics and the supply chain as it relates to EPS and margin. But curious if there's any sales impact to your ability to kind of get raw feedstock, et cetera, that you want to call out. Just because if you look at even midpoint of your guidance for the full year, just having a little trouble reconciling the two-year and the three-year kind of growth stack deceleration from what you just printed. Monish Patolawala : So, John, I would just say, back to the point on Q2, there is a lot of uncertainty in the supply chain markets other than of course the raw material and logistics costs we've talked about. It's just making sure that the product is flowing, making sure our suppliers can make the product. As of right now, as I said, it's a very dynamic situation that's changing every day. So that is why that's one of the uncertainties that we have called out in the second quarter and the total year, that we've got to navigate through this and hopefully as we get through the second quarter, we'll be in a better state to see where we are for the year. So hopefully that answers your question. Since you're talking about the second quarter -- and my memory failed me earlier. Sorry. So Steve's question earlier also on if you're looking at Q1 versus Q2, just another point is FX which is $0.13 benefit in Q1 for the year. We still see that to be $0.15. Again, we'll see where currencies move as the world plays itself out. And then from a tax rate perspective, we were at 16.4% for the first quarter, and our plan is 20% to 21% for the year. So those are the other items I would talk about, John, as I talk about the second quarter and its overall impact. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe a broader question here. You talked a little bit earlier about kind of new product vitality. You're talking about a lot of interesting technologies around enabling your sustainability commitments. Is there a way for 3M to actually commercialize some of the stuff that you're doing to your own operations, either the technology or the material science? Or can you take what you're doing and actually bring that out to other customers and monetize that? Mike Roman : Yeah. And, John, I would say for us being a leader in sustainability is also about helping our customers and making a difference for them, and you see that in our expectations and our requirement that every one of our new products has an improvement, an advantage in sustainability. That's one of the ways we can leverage our technology and our technology platforms to make a difference for customers. Now, we're also investing a lot of innovation in our operations, and you look at our fundamental strengths of the company. Our manufacturing capabilities are foundational there. And about one-third of our intellectual property sits in our manufacturing operations, process technologies, and we leverage that for our own performance and our own product quality as a competitive advantage. There are opportunities as we think about ways that we can really lead forward in sustainability solutions that we can expand our impact, and we certainly expect to be able to be a good example for manufacturing companies leading in sustainability. We'll look at, as we have all along, look at innovation opportunities where we can commercialize those as part of our offerings to customers as well. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So my first question, maybe just going back to 2Q for a moment. And I fully recognize that things are fluid right now, but can you talk a little about maybe the trends that you're seeing so far in 2Q? You've got very easy comps this quarter. So is the expectation that you'll see at least an acceleration in growth versus what you saw in 1Q based on what you're seeing today? Monish Patolawala : Yeah, Joe, so no major surprises in Q2 so far. So we've started April pretty strong, similar to what we thought it would be. The team continues to execute well. We're working through some of the challenges we have talked about whether it's on the cost or the product availability side. But as you currently pointed out, from a comp basis on the year-over-year basis we will get into the first major quarter of the pandemic. And therefore on a year-over-year basis you should see a higher growth than what you saw in Q1. Mike Roman : Joe, as a reminder, last year in Q1 we were up 20 basis points organically I believe, and we were down lower, 13%, in Q2. So the comp is a fair amount easier. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense. Just wanted to clarify that and then maybe my second question, Monish, you talked about 30% to 40% type volume incrementals when you have decent volumes. I guess can you clarify that comment? Is that an all-in number, taking into account some of the headwinds that you've already discussed on the raw material side or is that just purely on volumes? Just clarifying those comments. Monish Patolawala : Joe, it's a great question. So I would say 30% to 40% is in the long term what you should get leverage. 2021 in general is I think unusual. Unusual on multiple fronts, one when we gave you the guide in the beginning of the year we talked about the snapback of indirect costs that should hopefully in 2021 as people start traveling, as we start investing, from an ad merch perspective would go up on a year over. Similarly, at the beginning of the year we reset our comps, so that's a headwind. We also had a property sale in fourth quarter of last year of approximately $50 million of gain that's a non-repeat. So all of those one-time headwinds coming into the year that we talked about. We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability in 2021 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. And then the third as has come through that I've talked about is the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield, and then managing all the other costs that we have whether it's legal costs as PFAS and Combat Arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term. That's why I would say 30% to 40% is the normal you should see in the long term, but 2021 is just a little odd for these reasons. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense. Thank you for clarifying. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, I am pleased with our first quarter performance as we drove strong growth, earnings, and cash flow. We executed well and continue to build for the future through investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability. We are well positioned for a successful 2021 and remain focused on delivering value for our customers and returns for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 27, 2021.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. As we have done throughout the year, I would like to remind you to mark your calendars for our next earnings call, which will take place on Tuesday, October 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll now hand it off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. 3M's performance in the second quarter was strong as we posted organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow.  From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care elective procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide. Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10. Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples. In Health Care, our innovative Prevena therapy Incision Management System is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system. In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business. In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of Command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas. As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to $2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders. One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and our adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed. As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments. In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation. I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges, and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments, and I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. A strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items, added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year. Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income or 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share. Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respiratory liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the Combat Arms Earplug multidistrict litigation, with one trial in September and one in October. And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year. Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50. As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs. Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share.  Finally, 3 non-operating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses, that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year. Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by a timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2. Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter, driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior pandemic impacts. First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, gearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remains strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single-digits for our personal safety business. Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M products versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms. Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs. Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care elective procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our medical solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in advanced wound care. Sales in our oral care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction. Health Care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels.  Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly Command, Filtrete and Meguiar's.  Stationery and office grew strong double-digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's cohort related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for Scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to work please. Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer Health and Safety business was up double-digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers. Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong. However, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year. For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year. Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind. And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year. Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70. Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time. Turning to the third quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care elective procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds, I expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs. On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress. To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times.  With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good morning, Mike and Monish. I'm on Slide 13 in the appendix, just looking at the price data. And based on my notes, price was up about, I think, 70 basis points last quarter. It looks like 10 basis points this quarter, but the real headwind was Asia Pacific. What -- can you give us a little color into kind of -- I know some of this might be mix. So what's impacting the price dynamic, perhaps there's some comp issues to there. So I'll just leave it at that. Monish Patolawala : Yes. Sure, Scott. It's a great question. And you're right. But as I first said, we are raising prices everywhere. It's taking a little bit of time, but it's broad-based. You've seen what we have said we'll do in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. To answer your question specifically on the second quarter, you hit on one point, which is a comp issue from year-over-year but the second piece of this was also as the volumes came in pretty strong in the second quarter, we had some rebates that get accounted for with that extra volume, and that drove it. But when you reflect on the guide that we gave you, price pretty much came in where we had thought. It's just slightly lower than that. So we were expecting this. Scott Davis : Okay. And then was there a supply chain impact on sales, an explicit supply chain impact on sales that held back sales? Or was it more just a cost logistics issue? Monish Patolawala : I would say, Scott, it's really hard to figure out exactly what the impact was. There definitely was an impact, I would say, in general, in the larger market and 3M was no different where supply constraints were there. The team has done a marvelous job of trying to keep the factories running the best they can and making sure we are taking care of our customers as quickly as we can. So I would say there were more inefficiencies that we have had to deal with just as raw material was not as fluid as we would have thought through this process. But overall, we have done our best to keep our customers whole through this process. But this is an ongoing piece, Scott, that we'll have to watch how the second half plays itself out. You're seeing not only us but end markets also getting impacted by some of the raw material shortages, and we're just going to keep working this as we go through the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can you guys talk a little bit about the durability in the Health Care margins? Impressive back to 25% this quarter, I'm just wondering if this is now kind of like a baseline going forward. We're back to kind of like the 2019-ish type levels. Monish Patolawala : Yes. I think, Joe, that's a great question. I think we also keep looking at that all the time. I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped, but we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be? As I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can. Joseph Ritchie : Maybe just following up on that, it is helpful to have that context. As I think about just the Health Care business, right, you did mention that elective procedures have increased and perhaps maybe that's going to offset some of the respirator issue. Should we think of that as being mix-accretive? If, in fact, elective procedures are increasing and are potentially offsetting the weakness in respirators? Monish Patolawala : I would tell you, I think the way we got to think about it is, as electives go up, we don't have a one-for-one perfect connection between electives. So it depends on which piece of the demand goes up, Joe. So it's really hard to give you the perfect answer on whether it's mix or not. What I generally believe is as elective procedures go up and as volume picks up, you will see us getting more leverage because of that. How much the disposable respirator volume goes down and where it comes from will also have an impact. So it's a hard one for me to quantify exactly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just want to say that Slide 9 is especially helpful with all the moving parts, your assumptions for the year and assumptions for the third quarter. So I appreciate all those specifics. And my first question is on capital allocation. You got the balance sheet in good shape, 1.3x net leverage. You did restart buybacks, but still share count looked -- looks like it increased. Why would you not be doing more buybacks here? And can we start there, please? Monish Patolawala : Yes. Sure, Deane. As I told you, from our priority of capital allocation, our first priority is always investing organically between R&D and CapEx because we think that's the biggest return for our money. The second is dividend. You've seen we have increased dividend. It's 63rd year in a row that dividend is up. It matters to our shareholders. That's our second priority. Our third priority is M&A, and we will normally do M&A in the area where we believe that the target that we're going to acquire can benefit from being a part of 3M. Right now, we are busy integrating Acelity, and the team is doing a nice job integrating that. So we don't see any acquisitions of the size of Acelity in the near future, but we have an active pipeline of a number of things. And then our last discretionary use of capital allocation is share buyback. So for the year, year-to-date, we have done $700 million, give or take. And I would say share buyback and continued share back depends on what the volume is going to be, depends on the needs of future capital in uses that we have as well as what the cash flow that we generate will depend on that. So I would say, we'll keep you posted during these quarterly calls as we continue this program and decide how much we do. Deane Dray : Terrific. And then just as a follow-up, given all the changes, it seems like day-to-day in the macro, any commentary about how July has started, especially regionally would be helpful here? Mike Roman : Yes, Dean, I would say, I start with the expectation that the team is going to continue to execute well as we go into the second half of the year. And we've talked about some of the dynamics. Monish outlined a number that we're seeing. I would say, so far, no surprises as we start the first few weeks of July. We are expecting the global macroeconomic and end market strength to continue. It will remain fluid. We talked about the uncertainties as we look into the second half. We expect and are seeing continued increase in elective procedures in health care, home improvement, expected to remain strong. Industrial, more broadly, generally improving as we go in the second half. We talked about it in the first half, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, and we expect this to continue it. The uncertainty there is COVID and the impact on any increases in cases and hospitalizations. There are certainly some areas around the world where we're seeing that. And even as we talk about the decline in respirator -- disposable respirator demand globally, we're seeing areas that we are increasing supply. And so that's going to be one of the things that can impact second half geographically across the world. So we -- while we expect overall pandemic-related respirator demand to decline, we expect some areas we'll see stronger demand as COVID plays out. So that gives you a little bit of a view of how we look around the world second half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe just for the first one, a clarification. I wanted to know if you could give us an order of magnitude of what you're looking at in terms of price increases that you plan to put through across the product portfolio and obviously, understand it will probably vary by product line. And then second question is, if I look at your kind of organic growth, kind of the same growth-on-growth in Q2 as Q1. Was curious if you have any commentary around customer channel inventory? And if you're seeing any change in behavior there? Mike Roman : Yes, John, I would say price -- our teams are focused, as Monish talked about, on taking price in the second half to help us offset what we're seeing in inflation. And that's fairly broad-based. We -- it takes -- as we talked about, it takes some time to implement price changes and get ahead of inflation and it's been -- inflation has been an ongoing challenge as we've gone through the year. So we're expecting to see stronger price broad-based as we get into the second half and into fourth quarter, we start to see a price raw positive impact. And if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region in the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sets. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to try and circle back to the Safety and Industrial outlook. I suppose it's possible if we look at Q4 that your sales in that segment could be down year-on-year in aggregate because of respirators. Just wondered any perspectives on that? And also, the margin implication in 2020, your S&I margins were up a good amount. Q2, they're softer, I think, sequentially and year-on-year as the respirator business rolls over. So should we expect that sort of mix headwind to play out for a few more quarters? Monish Patolawala : Yes. I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of Safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one I would say is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth, because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa : Can you just maybe talk about, other than the mask headwind kind of sequentially, do you expect the kind of auto stuff -- like what else is getting worse sequentially, kind of when we think about 3 to 4 -- 3Q and 4Q trends? Monish Patolawala : So Steve, I would say, I would just put everything in the context of back to end markets, in total, we feel will remain strong. I think you're going to see volatility as we get through the second half with what happens with COVID. So a couple of items to note. We believe that elective procedures will continue to go up quarter-over-quarter. But in some parts of the world, you could see it go down. Secondly, I would say auto does show an increase. It's still on a year-over-year headwind, down 3% in the third quarter. And if my memory is right, it's projected to be down 3.7% in the fourth quarter. I think the semiconductor shortages will have an impact on what happens there, and we'll see where that plays itself out. Smartphone shipments are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. We'll see where it lands sequentially. And then tablets and TVs, which also were benefited tremendously last year, are also projected to be down on a year-over-year basis, but hard to quantify what exactly it looks like on a sequential basis. You have seen us -- you have seen a pretty good increase in stationery and office supply in the second quarter. That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school, but depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I -- go ahead. Stephen Tusa : I guess at the high end of the range, I think first half to second half, sales are down, which makes sense because of the mask dynamic. And normally, seasonally, I think they\u2019re down in the 4Q from a modestly up 3Q versus 2Q. But I guess is there anything this year seasonally, i.e. kind of the semi shortages kind of pushing demand to be a little bit better seasonally sequentially? You're kind of saying there's a lot of moving parts and like. So it's kind of normal seasonality and then including kind of the masks? Monish Patolawala : That's right, Steve. There is a lot of variability. But we'll keep you posted in there. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Yes. So on the raw mats, Monish, based on your FICO convention and food purchasing, et cetera, when do you expect commodity inflation to peak? I don't know whether that's on a year-over-year basis or whether that's on a sequential basis, but when do you expect to see the peak in those raw mats? Monish Patolawala : So if you're asking specifically on commodities, I think it's a really hard one to call. For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which has now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins we are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor cost, but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics cost has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. Where that will peak? I think, in my view -- and I may be wrong here -- at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand, there's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we are going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy, inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say, when does it peak and when it start coming down. So we've taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw. And in the fourth quarter, our anticipation is that we should be able to get it to be flat to positive, which means price will offset the raw material inflation. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's really helpful explanation. I think I'll stick with you here on the second half outlook. You're calling out legal costs, legal defense costs in the second half of the year. You didn't give a number around that. So I'm assuming it's not that material, but how do you think about just the magnitude of that in the back half? I'm just concerned if defense costs are not settlements necessarily. I'm thinking here about the earplug litigation and also Hoosick Falls settlement that you just announced? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I think the first one that the Hoosick Falls settlement was a part of our reserve. So that was a part of the calculus already. I would say we will -- we are -- it's ongoing litigation. If you look at all the SEC material that we file as well as the Q that will get filed later on the day, should give you an update of all the cases. But just for your benefit, we got a PFAS case coming up in the October of this year. It's with Wolverine and the use of PFAS in there, and we've got 2 Combat Arm trials coming up. So as we prepare for those cases, that's the increased cost in legal fees. And what I would tell you is we will spend what is required to defend ourselves as we go through these cases and that's what the cost is being incurred for. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a sort of longer-term question. I think, historically, 3M has very strong position in terms of sort of global capacity in your key technologies. How do you think about sort of global nonwoven capacity post COVID? And are you seeing emergence of new players? Does it change sort of strategic landscape for 3M vis-\u00e0-vis players, particularly players out of Asia longer term? Mike Roman : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. We -- as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we saw probably the peak of demand, at least near term, in Q1. And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean, we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety, personal protective equipment in normal times, and that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand? We think we'll end up somewhere above where we were pre-pandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that. Andrew Obin : I guess my question was sort of broader and longer term. A lot of this technology is used air filters, automotive, and I was just wondering if you expect this incremental capacity that was brought on by your competitors to go into these industrial adjacencies and generate just more global competition. That was the question actually. Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew, I can speak about us. I mean we are -- our nonwoven capacity, we do leverage that and utilize that in other areas, other products that we have like air filtration. So it is an opportunity for us that even with the capacity that we've built to be -- respond to the pandemic, we can take advantage of that and use that in other areas. And that's something that we're able to do broadly. We take our technologies and find innovative uses for them and air filtration is one of those. Will others do that? I'm sure there will be a focus in other markets for some of that capacity around the world. How much? I don't know how to give you a view of that perspective. The world will continue to grow, and we see trends in personal safety, air filtration. So the demand is going to continue to grow. So to some degree, it will -- the demand -- the capacity will grow into the demand as we go forward over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So you always give kind of helpful color by geography, and there's been a lot of noise about things kind of falling down in China with respect to a lot of different pieces of macro data. Can you guys just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China across your businesses? Mike Roman : Sure, Nicole. I -- like I highlighted for the broader business, we saw broad-based growth, double-digit growth in our Transportation and Electronics, our Safety and Industrial and our Health Care businesses. Consumer was up mid-single-digits as we came through the quarter. And our growth was led by general industrial, some of the segments that are growing there, including our abrasives portfolio. Auto, OEM had strong growth and electronics. It's an important market for us. It's 10% of our total revenue. It grew over 20% in the first half. Last year, second quarter, we saw 3% growth. So China recovered, if you remember, ahead of other regions around the world. And when you look at the second half, comparisons start to get a little more challenging. And so we're expecting just year-over-year comps, I would say, we expect to see a little more challenge there. We still see opportunities for growth across our businesses in some of the same areas that we've highlighted on a global basis. Automotive will continue to be a focus, penetrating with the OEMs there. And we see -- even though it's our smallest business, we see significant opportunities to serve Chinese consumers through our consumer business, especially in areas like air and water quality. So it's -- we see opportunities, maybe a more challenging year-over-year comp, but still opportunities for growth. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks, Mike. And if I could just follow-up on the second half margin outlook. There's clearly a lot of moving pieces here with legal costs, growth investments, price cost. Maybe just to boil it down, do you guys still expect to kind of be in that 30% to 40% incremental margin range in 3Q and 4Q? Monish Patolawala : So I would just say, Nicole, volume is the biggest driver that gives us leverage. So I think that's step #1 with all the volatility, the uncertainty that's out there. The question is where does second half volumes land as well as we've given you the range on disposable respirators are going to be down $100 million to $300 million on a year-over-year basis. The team continues to drive operating rigor so driving productivity and efficiency across the supply chain. We are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact. So I would boil it down to saying what margin will come down to in the second half and what incrementals are, will depend on the volume, will depend on our ability to offset the price -- the raw and logistics pressure through price increase, continued productivity and good execution by the 3M team. And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling. You've seen we've been very disciplined in the first half of making sure that we didn't spend ahead of what volumes come back. But as we see volumes coming back in, you're going to see those indirect start snapping back up. And then the last one is the legal fees and continuing to do what we think is right to protect ourselves as these cases go through. So that's all the factors that will ultimately impact what the incrementals are going to be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Eitan Buchbinder : This is Eitan Buchbinder on for Andy Kaplowitz. Priority growth platforms delivered 10% growth in Q1. Can you update on how the group performed in Q2 as well as your outlook for the faster-growing businesses in the back half of the year? Mike Roman : Yes, Eitan. The priority growth platforms also had strong growth. We talked about it in Q1, second quarter as well. So overall, they were up over 40% in second quarter. Now over $500 million in revenue as a group. And I highlighted a couple of other areas of our businesses that are seeing strong sequential growth and market dynamics that are attractive. So these priority growth platforms broadly are in attractive market spaces. Part of that priority investment in growth that we've been talking about even as we came through 2020, staying focused and aggressively investing in growth areas and PGPs, as we call them, the priority growth platforms, continue to be an important part and performing well. Eitan Buchbinder : That's helpful. The Electronics Business Group was up 13% year-over-year, but down sequentially about 4%. So could ongoing chip supply constraints lead the business to decline sequentially in Q3? Mike Roman : Well, we saw, as we said, some strength in the end markets. And I think it's -- the first half, we were up overall, still low teens for the business. And maybe it's -- I would say the -- it was really more of a seasonality than a sequential dynamic. And as we get to the second half, the one other thing I would add, we're going to start to see some more challenging comps. We saw strong growth dynamics, not only in our home improvement and other areas in consumer also in the cleaning supplies business as we went through the pandemic. So that's the other dynamic to watch. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, our second quarter performance was strong, marked by broad-based growth, increased margins and robust cash flow. I'm confident in our ability to continue executing well as we navigate COVID-19 impacts. And we will stay focused on taking advantage of market trends and overcoming supply challenges while continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. In a dynamic environment, our performance throughout 2021 has shown the skill of our people around the world the resiliency of our business model, and the relevance of our technologies. In the third quarter end-year-to-date, we have delivered broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with good margins and strong cash flow.  Q3 organic growth was over 6% as we drove innovation across our market-leading businesses with margins of 20% and earnings of $2.45 per share. Geographically, growth in the quarter was led by the Americas, up 7% with the US up 6% growth in APAC was 6% with China up 3%, and Japan up 6%.  While EMEA grew 4%. With respect to the macro-environment, overall end-market demand remains strong, though the semiconductor shortage continues to impact many markets, most visibly in electronics and automotive. As we navigate near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability, which I will discuss shortly. We are also actively managing disruptions in the global supply chain with a relentless focus on customer service. Looking at our performance through nine months, we have executed well and delivered 11% organic growth, with all business groups about 10%, along with margins of 22% and earnings of $7.81 per share.  Today, we are updating full-year expectations for organic growth to a range of 8% to 9% and EPS to a range of $9.70 to $9.90, reflecting our results to-date and ongoing supply chain challenges. I would like to make a few comments on how 3M is actively managing those challenges. As you know, many companies are facing supply chain disruptions. The result of a convergence of issues, including the Delta variant, strong demand, energy and labor shortages, and extreme weather events. For example, ocean freight costs have more than doubled over the last year. And the number of containers on the water is up 70% because of port congestion.Suppliers are challenged to provide consistent and predictable supply. On any given day we are working with more than 300 suppliers with critical constraints. With manufacturing sites in 35 countries around the world. And as a $5 billion annual exporter out of the US, we are working tirelessly to serve our customers. The cornerstone of 3M's response is our expertise and deep relationships across the supply chain along with our local for local managed factoring and supply chain strategy, which helps us move with agility and keep our factories running. We have daily meetings with suppliers to strengthen our planning, and in some instances, are strategically prioritizing geographies and markets and portfolios.  Hard but necessary decisions to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We are moving product in different ways, such as expanding our use of rail, shipping out of more flexible ports, and increasing our use of charter flights by over 40%, while deploying new capabilities to better track our flow of goods in real-time. Maintaining talent is also key and we are using several tactics to attract new workers while protecting the health and safety of all of our employees. Some of our actions have impacted our productivity and gross margins,which Monish will touch on. But we will do what is necessary to take care of customers. The combination of strong demand along with supply chain challenges is also contributing to broad-based inflation. We're taking multiple actions to help offset inflationary pressures, including price increases, dual-sourcing, and improving factory yields, with more work to do.  Ultimately, the duration of these supply chain challenges is difficult to predict. We remain focused on serving customers, managing backlogs, and making good on our commitments, delivering the unique, high-quality products that are the hallmark of 3M. Please turn to Slide 5. While we execute day-to-day, we are investing to drive long-term growth and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets.  In home improvement for example, we have multiple $0.5 billion plus franchises that keep families healthier and more productive, including our fast-growing command, damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete, home filtration products.These brands leverage 3M's deep expertise in adhesives and non-woven materials. The same technologies helping drive success in our automotive business, which consistently outgrows build rates. Auto electrification sales are up 40% year-to-date. On the strength of new innovations, including advanced display technologies as automobiles become the next consumer electronic device. In healthcare, the biopharma market is growing more than 10% annually. With our business up more than 30% year-to-date as 3M Science has supported the unprecedented pace of advancement over the past 18 months to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and scale manufacturing to help address the pandemic. The fundamental strengths of 3M our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and leading brands position us to win. And we will continue to invest in these areas.  In a similar way, we're driving productivity by advancing digital capabilities across our operations, allowing us to expand our use of data and data analytics. In sustainability, we have achieved 50% renewable electricity use in our operations, four years ahead of our timeline, on our way to 100%. We are advancing the environmental goals we announced earlier in the year, making the investments to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality, reduced water use, and improve the quality of water returned to the environment from our industrial processes. In addition, we are proactively managing PFAS, making our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. In Cottage Grove Minnesota, we recently announced that we are closing our incinerator and partnering with a leading disposal Company to more efficiently manage our waste streams. We just broke ground to add new filtration technology in Cordova Illinois. [ inaudible 00 :09:50] Belgium, we're working with government officials to resolve issues related to p fast and we will invest up to a 125 million Euros over the next 3 years to improve water quality around our factories.  These proactive initiatives and others are accelerating 3M's ability to go beyond current regulatory standards and deliver on our commitments. With respect to the P fast strategic road map announced last week, 3M remains committed to working with the Biden administration, EPA, and others, and taking a science-based approach to managing PFS. Let me also touch on a few litigation updates. Last week, we announced a collaborative agreement to resolve litigation related PFAS in our facility, indicator Alabama.  The impact is included in our previously disclosed reserves. On combat arms, there have been for Bellwether trials so far, with six additional trials here in the fourth quarter, we are early in this litigation and will continue to actively defend ourselves, including through the appeal process. As always, we encourage you to read our 10-Q for updates on all litigation matters. To wrap up, we are driving strong results in a challenging environment, investing in attractive end markets and positioning 3M for continued growth. I'm proud of our 3M team, which is united by a common purpose, Unlocking the power of people, ideas, and science, to re-imagine what's possible and create what's next. Now, we will turn it over Monish, who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. As I look back on the quarter, the 3M team demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the relevance of our technologies as we executed well in a very challenging environment, effectively navigating the supply-chain disruptions while serving and innovating for our customers.  Though manufacturing, raw materials, and logistics challenges persisted throughout the quarter. We continue to invest in the business while driving operating rigor and managing costs. Turning to the third quarter, financial results, sales were $8.9 billion up 7.1% year-on-year, or an increase of 6.3% on an organic basis. Operating income was $1.8 billion down 6% with operating margins of 20% coming in at the top end of the range, which we had previously communicated in mid-September.  Third quarter earnings per share were $2.45, which was similar to last year. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q3 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth was more than offset by the headwinds resulting from the global supply chain challenges, investments in growth and sustainability, and litigation-related costs. Combined, these impacts lowered operating margins by 1.4 percentage points, and earnings per share by $0.02 year-on-year. The restructuring program we announced in Q4 of last year remains on track.  As part of this program we incurred a Pretax restructuring charge of $50 million in the third quarter. This charge was offset by the benefits we achieved this quarter. Moving to price and raw materials. As expected, increases in selling price gain traction as we went through the quarter with year-on-year selling prices up 140 basis points in Q3 versus 10 basis points in Q2. However, we continue to experience higher costs for raw materials, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing, which outpaced the increase in selling prices.  Thus, third-quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings by 130 basis points and $0.12 per share, respectively versus Q3 last year. Looking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year. Next, foreign currency net of hedging impacts, reduced margins, 20 basis points, and earnings by $0.01 per share.Also, 3 other non-operating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, lower other expenses resulted in an $0.08 earnings benefit. Consistent with prior quarters, non-operating pension was a $0.05 benefit, along with the $0.02 benefit from net interest due to our proactive early redemption of debt. Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.09 benefit to earnings per share. The tax rate was lower due to favorable adjustments this year related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Our year-to-date tax rate is 18.8%.  Therefore, we now expect our full-year tax rate in the range of 18.5 to 19.5% versus 20 to 21% previously. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding increased 1% versus Q3 last year, lowering per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Third-quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion was down 29% year-on-year with conversion of a 107% Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $4.5 billion, which was similar to last year, with free cash flow conversion of 98%. The decline in our year-on-year free cash flow performance was primarily driven by higher inventory balances due to strong customer demand, along with raw material inflation, and more goods in transit as a result of the ongoing global supply chain challenges. Third quarter capital expenditures were $343 million and $1 billion year-to-date. For the full-year, we now expect Capex investments in the range of $1.5 to $1.6 billion versus being at the low end of our prior range of $1.8 to $2 billion. We continue to step up investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  However, the pace of projects continues to be impacted by supply chain and vendor constraints. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $856 million and share repurchases of $527 million year-to-date. we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt position, strong cash flow generation capability, and disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities, and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.  Please turn to slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. Organic growth was driven by continued robust industrial manufacturing activities, along with prior-year pandemic-related impacts. First, our personal safety business declined 4% organically, up against a 40% pandemic-driven comparison a year ago.  Third Quarter disposable respirator sales decreased 7% organically year-on-year, and 15% sequentially. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. Turning to the rest of safety and industrial, organic growth was led by double-digit increases in adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and electrical markets. In addition, closure and masking systems was up high single-digits.  Automotive aftermarket, up low-single-digits, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year. Safety and Industrial's third quarter operating income was $620 million down 20% versus last year. Operating margins were 19.2% down 650 basis points year-on-year, as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by ongoing increases in raw materials, logistics, and litigation-related costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts. Moving to transportation and electronics which grew 5.1% organically despite the continued impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our Auto OEM business was flat year-on-year, compared to the 20% decline in global car and light truck bills. This out performance was due to a few factors. First, we continue to grow our penetration by driving 3M innovation onto new automotive platforms. Second, we saw notable increase in channel inventories at tier suppliers.  Given the dramatic reductions in OEMS bill forecast through the quarter. Lastly, we benefited from a vehicle model mix standpoint as auto OEMS produce more premium vehicles, which tend to have higher 3M content. Our electronics-related business decline low single-digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs, as OEMs face production challenges due to ongoing semiconductor constraints, and COVID-related impacts. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials and Commercial Solutions each grew double-digits year-on-year, while Transportation Safety grew low-single digits. Third quarter operating income was $465 million down 9% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19% down 320 basis points year-on-year, driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was more than offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts. Turning to our healthcare business, which delivered third quarter organic sales growth of 3.3%Our medical Solutions business declined, low single-digits organically impacted by the continued decline in demand for disposable respirator.  Along with the pace of hospital elective procedure volumes, which came in at the low end of industry expectations of 90 to 95% for the quarter. in our Auto Care business grew low, double-digits year-on-year as dental procedures continued to be near pre - COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased high single-digits year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health information systems grew low double-digits driven by strong growth in clinician solutions.  And finally, food-safety increased double-digits as food service activity returns. Healthcare's third quarter operating income was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.5% up 70 basis points. Third quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which is partially offset by the increasing raw materials and logistics cost, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our consumer business, was 7.6% year-on-year with continued strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high single-digits on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand, particularly in our command and Filtrete category, leading franchises.  Stationery and office grew double-digits organically in Q3, as this business laps last year's COVID -related comparisons. We also had strong back-to-school consumer demand and holiday related sell-in for scotch branded packaging and shipping products, posted solutions and scotch branded home and office tapes.Our home care business was up low single-digits versus last year's strong COVID -driven comparison. And finally, our consumer health and safety business was up high single-digits as we lap COVID -related impacts from a year ago. Consumers operating income was $332 million down 3% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.7% down basis points, as increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, more than offset leverage from sales growth.  Please turn to slide 9 for a discussion of our full-year 2021 guidance. As we reflect on the macroeconomic environment, we expect demand to remain strong across most end markets. However, uncertainty persists given the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, along with the well-known global supply chain, raw materials, and logistics challenges that all companies are working through.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on our customers and doing what is necessarily to solve them as we continue to navigate the fluid environment. Turning to guidance, we're increasing the bottom end of our expectations for organic growth. We now project our full-year organic growth to be in the range of 8% - 9% versus our prior range of 6% - 9%. With respect to earnings, we anticipate a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share as compared to our prior range of $9.70 to $10.10. And finally, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow, therefore, we are maintaining our free cash flow conversion range of 90 to 100%.  This updated outlook implies a wider than normal fourth quarter range accounting for ongoing impacts of COVID and the uncertain supply-chain environment. For example, from a growth perspective, the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply are impacting more and more end markets, most notably automotive and consumer electronics, as reflected in the low production forecast for the year. We anticipate global elective healthcare procedure volumes to stabilize with recent trends.  Relative to disposable respirator, we expect continued impacts from the decline in healthcare related demand along with elevated inventory levels in the industrial channel. And finally, we expect our pricing actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate raw material and logistics cost pressures.  Turning to operations. As we have discussed, we are actively managing inefficiencies in global supply chains with a relentless focus on customer service. Therefore, we are adjusting demand plans with greater frequency. And as a result, incurring more manufacturing production changeovers along with expediting shipments. All of these actions are impacting both costs and productivity. But we 're taking the necessary steps to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We continue to make progress relative to December 2020 restructuring announcement. To date, we have incurred over $240 million in pretax restructuring charges and anticipate an additional $25 to $50 million in Q4. We now expect total pretax restructuring charges of $300 to $325 million versus our original expectations of $250 to $300 million. We expect the remaining actions under this program to be initiated by the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect to incur higher costs related to our ongoing litigation matters, along with increases in our other indirect related costs like travel expense. And finally, we continue to invest in the business for the long term. And therefore anticipate increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  To close, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers who have placed their faith in us, our vendors who are tirelessly working with us to ensure continuity of supply, and most importantly, our 90,000 plus 3Mers who continue to deliver for our customers. We have a very steady eye on the long term to deliver growth, margin, and cash through strong operating rigor, while continuing to navigate the uncertainty in the short-run. With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Operator : First question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the details on the quarter. So Monish, you mentioned the 19%, 20% margin for 3Q. You came in at the high end of that range. Obviously, you'd like to be conservative, but I'm just curious, what's in better or maybe not quite as bad as you expected or see it back in mid-September. Monish Patolawala : That's great question, Nigel. I think when I gave you the range of 19% to 20%, as we have said in my prepared remarks, we were facing a lot of inflation. At the same time, there is a lot of uncertainty as regards volumes, as regards supply chain flow. And then third, I'd also mentioned that as we were facing all those items, we were also doing our own self-help versus just letting these things go through whether it was guild sourcing, whether it was controlling some of our expenses, etc.  And then you put all that together, we came in at the 20%. If you look at where we ended up, I would say inflation came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. We executed on price, we moved from 10 basis points of price increase in Q2 to a 140 basis points in Q3. So that was pretty much in line, and we were able to execute more volumes of our vendors. with flow of supply. We were able to get good flow supply.  There's strong demand, as Mike said, and we were able to execute the demand, as well as we controlled our expenses across the corporation to make sure that we were prioritizing on serving our customers and trying to mitigate impact of inflation as much as we could. So put all that in, we came in at the 20% versus the range of 19 to 20 that I mentioned earlier. Nigel Coe : That's great. Thank you.On the margin bridge, based on -- based on your 4Q for your full-year guidance, looks like 4Q margins looked at an 18 handle. Maybe my math offset, but I'd be curious if you can maybe talk to that and maybe the two major margin budget items, the volume productivity, supply chain, and pipe costs 100.8 base points negative on volume productivity and 130 on price cost this quarter. How does that look in a broad sense for 4Q year-over-year? Monish Patolawala : So I would start by sayin, Nigel, a couple of things. So your math is not real, if you follow the implied guide that we gave you. It's directionally very close. I think a couple of things on just the items you talked about, which is priced raw. We expect to continue to have continued momentum in price in the fourth quarter.  You saw us again go up from 10 to 140 basis points and we should see that go up as price continues to take hold across the various geographies and product lines, things that we've talked about before. I would say we don't see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way. I think you're going to see that volatility.  It's going to depend on what the holiday season does. It depends on what logistics costs are going to be. Our goal is to get to neutral. The question is going to be, how does raw materials at some point play itself out, and do we see a turn in some of the commodities like, polypropylene, ethylene, etc, where we have seen a lot of inflation?  I would say that's number 1 on your question. I think there was another point on bridge on revenue. I would just say if you're looking 3 to 4Q, just remember there are a couple of things that impact 3M. There's one less billing day from 3Q to 4Q and secondly, you have a normal seasonality that you have in 3M as many of the factories with our industrial customers slowed down during the holidays and that's the impact. So I think you've answered your question, but if there's anything else I'm happy to answer, Nate. Nigel Coe : No, that's perfect Monish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Just want to pick a touch on auto a little bit. Kind of extraordinary divergence and the numbers there as you laid out, I just wondered, does that create some kind of significant headwind for you now, as you look forward, obviously we should have volumes going up, but may have suppliers, I think that burn off inventory and mix shifts back. I was wondering if you could give us a little more perspective on what's going on there. Mike Roman : Maybe there's a couple of parts to that I'll talk about. The first -- if you look at what we've done year-to-date, it's really been reflective of our innovation, something we've been talking about for some time, we outgrow the build rates and even in dynamic like this year where the build rates are swinging down as there were some challenges in OEM production plans for Q3 and the outlook for Q4 being similar.  We're continuing to drive our innovations when spec -in's and design-in opportunities. And then Monish mentioned the mix of vehicles in this demand environment is more premium, which we have a higher level of penetration in those vehicles. We also have very good growth in our Auto electrification. priority growth platform and broadly, and getting good traction, 40% year-to-date. So those are all driving that performance as we come through a year-to-date and we expect to be able to continue to perform build rates as we go forward.  The channel -- everybody is challenged with matching up to the changes in production plans, and these are changing quickly and the dynamic has been challenging for the supply chains, and I would say everyone in the value chain to keep up with. That said we see inventory trying to track pretty well with that. We don't see really -- in our results, we're not seeing a year-to-date of impact from excess inventory, so it's really about matching up with where the mix is going, where the build rates are going, and again, we see good momentum in our portfolio against those build rates. Jeff Sprague : And just on your, maybe your Capex and what you are seeing your customers do. When I heard Monish talk about seasonal slowdown with everybody of run and full out here and trying to get caught up. Do you actually think it's possible we don't have a normal seasonal slowdown as people try that kind of execute on some of these backlogs and kind of separate move, a little bit unrelated, but your own Capex, what sort of projects did you have planned that are sliding to the right? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. It is -- good question Jeff. Listen, as we're trying to be helpful by giving you what we're seeing right now. Is there a possibility that customers continuing to keep running through 24/7, and that there's more production that comes out from them. Absolutely possible and as Mike mentioned in so have I, will do whatever it takes to make sure that we keep serving our customers. Overall, I would still say this is a short-term phenomenon.  Long-term, we're seeing good end-market trends. And that's why you're seeing us continue to invest. So your point on the next piece which is Capex and where we were I would say the areas where we're looking to keep investing, we're in all the 3 buckets, growth, productivity, and sustainability, and the cycle times to get Capex raw material for these businesses is just taking longer than we had originally thought. And that's why we had to slow it down to 1.5 to 1.6, but I would just end by -- your question by saying, Jeff, we are not done with the quarter.  This team knows how to fight, we are going to keep doing whatever it takes to keep serving for our customers as long as the demand is there and at the same time, the teams furiously working to make sure that we mitigate some of the raw material pressure that we have, as well as keep investing for growth, productivity, and sustainability because we just see the long term to be very bright where we can grow above the macro, we can get margin expansion and keep having strong cash. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, Good morning. Maybe just the first question around China, Hong Kong demand. And obviously 3M has a very large presence in the region. Good perspectives on different industries. The growth rate slowed, I think to 3% in Q3, that was down from low double-digit last Quarter and low thirties in Q1.  So just wondered, do we think that that China, Hong Kong may be down in the fourth quarter and maybe just describe how you see what's going on there as being maybe different or idiosyncratic or do you think about pace of slowdown is a good template for what we should expect elsewhere in the world as the demand recovery matures. Mike Roman : Yes, Julian, if you look -- step back and look at year-to-date, China 's up mid-teens for us. So that, I think reflective of strong growth through Q3. And as you pointed out, we saw a 3% in the quarter. I would say it's having an impact from the same things we've been talking about, supply chain, logistics, port closures. Those are impacting our business. And just as a reminder, our business in China, so we manufacture most of what we sell in China in factories in China.  And we sell to customers -- about 50% of them exposed to exports about 50% to the domestic market. And the exports are probably one of the areas that's hard to sit. So it's down about 10%. Looking forward, that's the expectation as we go forward with Q4. So that'll be one of the impacts, has been one of the impacts being hurt most by the supply chain challenges for us,our focus in China has really been very much in line with what we've been talking about as we came through the pandemic, we see market segments that are high-growth and we've been prioritizing investments there and we see those growth trends continuing.  So we are that's where we're focused -- we're focused where we have the kind of the winning solutions. And we do see opportunities across each of our businesses year-to-date, we've been led with strong growth in Our Home Care business are actually in Q3 and the Healthcare business we expect that to continue as we go into Q4. Monish Patolawala : Julian, just to add to Mike's point on all the items you mentioned on the macro trends. Just on a year-over-year basis to for the quarter at 3%. You also got to look at the comp of last year. We had a very strong growth in China, if you remember, the third quarter of last year, you had seen China starting to come out of the pandemic first. So their order patterns were higher in the end of like June and then into the third quarter.And that's the other reason you see a 3% Julian Mitchell : That's helpful.Thank you.Maybe just my follow-up around safety and industrial margins,understand what's going on with some of the markets in terms of supply chain constraints and the impact that's having on margins.  But maybe focusing on the impact of the legal costs. And also as the respirator business moves slower sequentially. Any color you could provide on the impact that those two things are having on margins. Perhaps sizing that legal headwind. And do we expect that to bleed into next year as well? Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Yes, sure Julian.There are 2 ones, on the legal one, the combat arms litigation that we are incurring costs on show up in the CBG margins. As Mike mentioned, we are continuing to defend ourselves in that litigation. There's an acceleration in the fourth quarter. We will have EPS 5 more of these for which we're going to prepare. I would say, depending on how the litigation goes. Do you see it bleed into '22?  Yes, because the MDS will all not be done by fourth quarter of 2021 On disposable respirators as we've talked about, depending on seeing how the pandemic has played itself out. We felt Q1 was peak. We had mentioned that even in our last earnings call, we have seen revenue consistently, sequentially come down. You have seen we came down nearly 6% in the [Indiscernible] in the third quarter. We see that further down between 75 to a 125 on a year-over-year basis or 25 to 75 sequentially. And depending on where the pandemic goes, that will have an impact into 2022. But again, we've seeing pockets where you are seeing COVID cases go up, where you are seeing demand go up and then in other cases, you're starting to see demand come down. So it's pretty dynamic on the disposable respirator side, but as we've talked before, we've got capacity of 2.5 billion respirators that we can ramp up very quickly.  The team's done a really nice job of managing this environment in certain cases, we have shutdown manufacturing lines in certain cases, we are managing our inventory levels as we go through this, but we'll be ready for the next factor event. And hopefully never happens. But that's not being the history of the world, but we'll be ready for that. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Millios Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning, everybody. Mike Roman : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : The price increase in the quarter was a pretty dramatic quarter-to-quarter sequential change, but we've clearly seen pretty big step-ups in CPI and PPI. What -- when you think about 4Q and kind of think about the ramp into 2022, do you continue with this aggressive of a ramp. Is there any mitigating factors that holds you back from getting price?  I mean, I don't think I remember you guys being as far below CPI before. But these are strange times too. So I'm not sure it really matters. Just some color on that ramp would be helpful. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Scott. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you will see us continue to gain price in the fourth quarter. I know they've been quite a few questions around why it has taken us this long to get price. As we mentioned before, we follow up pretty methodical approach of taking consistent, taking price across geographies. We work with our customers. In certain cases, we are working with contracts and the constraints in those contracts.  And we put a pretty thoughtful approach to how we go after price increases. How it goes into 2022, Scott, I think will also depend on where we see inflation going to be in '22 and beyond. Right now, I think we're comfortable with the price increases that we've taken, but we're going to keep doing it as long as we need to. As I mentioned the goal of the team is to get to neutral, but it's going to highly depend upon what happens with inflation. So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's how we're thinking about pricing from that angle. And we try to be as -- again, as I've said before, thoughtful and methodical in how we go [Indiscernible] we have a pretty rigorous approach on how we approach our customers and we try to work it as a partnership with both. And you've got different businesses, so you've got specting businesses where you are specting for a certain period of time.  You got healthcare where you got half my business where it's easier to take price. In other cases that are contracts. And then you've got the industrial margins, which is distributor lead. And then you've got the consumer business where we working with all the big retailer. So each one of them have a different dynamic. And we factor all that in and you've seen that we have made progress in Q3 and we'll keep making progress in Q4 and beyond. Scott Davis : As a follow-up in -- the China comments were helpful, but can you talk about some of the other major emerging markets and what you've seen as far as improvements or decrements over the quarter and outlook? Thank you. Mike Roman : Sure. Thanks to God. And just as a reminder, if you remember back to 2019, we aligned our businesses, now around four go-to-market models are globally. And so those businesses are executing global strategies locally everywhere around the world. And they -- each of them have a view of each of the regions, but I'll give you a view at a higher level. So we talked about America's being up 7% in the quarter and low double-digits year-to-date. The highest growth as we came through the quarters in Latin America and Canada and up double-digits across all business groups.  So again, similar to what we talked about. And the way we are seeing year-to-date demand across 3M globally, broad-based across business groups in the Americas. And I'd say it's still in a strong position, up 6% in the Quarter and double-digits for the year. EMEA, if you look at how we're doing there, we're growing high single-digits for the year, 9%, 4% in the quarter. We haven't seen a strong rebound in growth as other areas, but we are seeing a recovery now in healthcare and transportation and electronics starting to help drive that growth that we are seeing.  And in Asia-Pacific, grown mid-teens year-to-date, double-digit growth across the business groups. All business groups again, and as I mentioned, and we talked about China, mentioned Japan and in prepared remarks, that's been one of the improving areas is Japan now starting to see improving growth as we come through the year.  So not down -- not near the pre-COVID levels, yet. But again, starting to see some improvements, and in that case also being led by healthcare. So we're seeing some -- I would say the recovery of the electric procedures around the world being one of the dynamics that's helping to start drive improving growth. Scott Davis : Thank you. Good luck, guys. Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Monish Patolawala : Hi Deane Deane Dray : We've heard lots of specifics on material cost inflation. I'd like to hear some color on labor costs, labor shortages. I know Mike highlighted in the opening remarks about new initiatives for recruiting, I'd imagine higher comp and benefits are among those. And is this more of U.S. centered headwind or just how labor costs and shortages look globally? And start there, please. Monish Patolawala : So I would say, Dean e, it's a global item but it's more pronounced right now for us in the U.S. So we are seeing higher cost, whether it is cost driven by some of the i tems Mike mentioned as well as with the demand that we have, we are spending more money on overtime. And also we are seeing cost of inflation, which is labor cost that comes through us, through outsource manufacturing hard goods that we buy, we're also seeing inflation on that. But with that said, I do want to recognize all the employees of 3M who are tirelessly working to make sure that we are delivering for our customers in this tough demand environment, as well as a very tough supply environment. But we're confident, Dean e, will get through this. Deane Dray : Do you have a year-over-year labor cost? Any kind of specifics you can help us with? Monish Patolawala : I don't have it very specific. I can ask Bruce to follow up and give you an answer. But just if you go back to the bridge on the walk for Q3, you can see there's a 140 basis points of pressure due to organic volume and productivity. Some of that is driven by labor constraints. In other words, the higher cost, but at the same time, making sure that we have all the production that we can make. And some of it is driven by the fact that we have had to have more changeovers because raw material has not been flowing properly. Deane Dray : Got it. And just as a follow-up on the Copaxone litigation, I was hoping you could comment on the strength of your insurance coverage. Both - we're just whether it's P fast specifically will see headline settlements. What we don't always have line of sight on is the insurance coverage. Are there any coverage limits and just help us frame for us the strength that the insurance coverage, if you could. Monish Patolawala : Yeah, so we do have insurance coverage. We are working with our various insurance providers through multiple dialogues that we keep having with them. But as you know, some of these things take time. So when we do get those settlements in, we'll definitely keep your costs too. Deane Dray : Okay. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America, please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Mike Roman : Hey, Andrew Monish Patolawala : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey, there's a question for bigger picture question for Mike and maybe Monish. I think 3M has a fairly unique integrated model, and the way your supply chain flows internationally, I think inside the Company is also fairly unique. Do these current supply chain constraints and shipping constraints : A, give you an opportunity to re-evaluate how your internal supply chain are constructed? and -- yeah, I'll just leave it at that. Mike Roman : Yeah, Andrew, it's one of our fundamental strengths and back to what Monish was talking about, how we're focused on delivering for customers. We're leveraging the strengths of our 3M model. The idea that we talked about in the prepared remarks, local for local, building our capabilities across our value model to the customers close to them regionally around the world. And that has been a strength as we've come through COVID and I would say this year as we deal with the interruption in supply chain, this regional strategy has allowed us to be more agile in just what Monish was talking about, the changing nature of our production plans in our production wheels in our -- what we're doing in our factory. So we have a lot of flexibility built in. I would say we are always evaluating how to better serve customers, how do we look at our lean value streams and how do we take new strategies into that getting -- based on, I would say, the improving visibility we have, we see opportunities to be more efficient and improve our cycle times and so on. So I -- we're always looking at changes.  I do think the model that we have has served us well and it's been great place to respond to the challenges. And I think that's the foundation as we go ahead. It's how do we make that better? How do we drive better performance, improving operational efficiency? So building on those strengths is where I'd leave you with. Andrew Obin : Thank you, Mike. And just a follow-up question. I apologize if I missed it, but on electric procedures, what's your best guess with sort of falling COVID cases in the U.S.? What's the most likely trajectory for likely procedures over the next, let's say 6 months? Monish Patolawala : So Andrew, that's one, of course, we keep watching very closely. We -- for the quarter, we ended up at -- I think the industry ended up at a lower end of the 90% to 95% that was originally forecasted. Part of it was, I think September was a tougher month as many countries saw a spike in COVID cases.  Our belief, and I think it's the industry's believe, that we should stabilize in the fourth quarter and we hopefully get back to the 90% to 95% range as we get into the fourth quarter. And then the bigger discussion around the industries, what does 2022 and beyond look like? The reason is a lot of these elective procedures that have been slowed down are elective, but they are still time-sensitive at the end of the day.  So there's -- so that's what we'll have to see and see both capacities added in all the countries we have to see how cases go -- play out from a COVID perspective. But I also think hospitals are far better equipped right now, or more prepared to deal with this. So our hope is that, elective procedures come back up to 2019 levels in 2022. When it happens, I think will depend on different parts of cases in the world, but that's how we see it. Andrew Obin : Do you see the possibility of a cumulative catch-up in '22? Monish Patolawala : Well, that's -- I think that's the debate, right? Who knows? But I think that's going to depend basically on hospital preparedness as well as patient readiness to come into the hospital to get their surgeries done. From our end, we would rather have the volume than not have the volume. So, I would say it will be a good problem to have, but I think we'll have to see what happens. Andrew Obin : Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. Everyone: Thanks to you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Everyone: Hi Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : I just wanted to dig into what you guys are seeing from a supply chain perspective a bit more. So if you could talk about any changes in the key bottlenecks versus last quarter's update. And is there a sense at all that there's green shoots here meeting that is there any possibility that the supply chain issues or headwinds have peaks? Mike Roman : While Nicole, I go back to it, it really is a convergence of multiple factors. And so you've got to pull those apart a little bit. The strong demand we think will continue to see strong demand. So that's going to put pressure on the supply chains going forward. We've seen challenges and labor shortages, the pandemic has impacted production, semiconductor shortages are impacting end markets for us in particular. And then we were also impacted as we went through the year with some extreme weather events which interrupted our raw material supply. Those are getting better. So some of the raw material supply issues that we were facing are getting better as we go and we do expect supply chains to improve. It's difficult to estimate or predict the duration of each of these factors and how they play with each other and watching the congestion in logistics is one of the things that we are carefully looking for improvements in as well.  Can we move back to more normal logistics patterns for us as we go forward, that will be a good sign that broadly supply chain disruptions are improving. But you have to keep an eye on each of these aspects to see step-by-step. And we do -- we are optimistic, we are hopeful as we get into 2022, that we're going to continue to see improvements. Monish Patolawala : Nicole, we also have a control tower that has been set up, so we're constantly watching whether it is the port congestion, whether it is shutdown of airports, whether it is customers, suppliers telling us that raw material, maybe few hours. So that's why we have new changings in our factories faster to keep other products moving so that we just make sure that we keep customer demand as well as customer demand itself is pretty variable right now. And that's another big thing that control towers doing his watching customer demand and then adjusting supply as needed. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks, Monish, thanks, Mike. That was helpful. And then I guess for 4Q, as you kind of think about the expectations by segment, we've kind of discussed elective procedures within healthcare. You guys talked a little bit about safety and industrial, what's going on with math. But I think both consumer and T&E are facing tougher comps in the fourth quarter. Is the expectation that those businesses can still grow organically or is there a risk they could be down year-on-year? Monish Patolawala : So I would start with just Transportation Electronics, that business has impacted the most by two.One is the auto industry, and second is the electronics industry and the semiconductor shortages hits that business squarely. I would say on the auto build the latest IHS forecast that we look at is, on a year-over-year 20% down as where auto builds are expected to be.  There's also, they're facing comps from last year in the electronics side. So whether it's consumer electronics, TVs, tablets, all of them, are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. I think we'll have to see where semiconductor shortages land up for that business, but they're Ashish and team are fighting hard and if the volumes they're going to do whatever it takes to make sure that the customers are served.  On consumer, you're right, that's also facing a very strong comp from last year, but you can see what they -- what Jeff and team have done in the first 11 months. We have seen strong growth. Our platforms where it was command or Filtrete are posted notes, etc., all have seen good growth in the third quarter. We saw a good early start in our stationary business and the holiday season. The question is whether that continues is the thing that we'll have to keep watching. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Hi Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. So what is like the underlying, like leverage this quarter? [ inaudible 01 :00:15] Back out price costs and then I think like the year-over-year on restructuring costs and savings and then temporary costs kind of mask things a little bit. But if I just -- if I kind of like back into what I'm getting something negative on the revenue growth. But then obviously there's the supply and that other inflation that you have to deal with. What is the underlying -- is the underlying leverage positive this quarter on that 5%? Or was it negative because of this, just have that out a little bit because a lot of moving parts here. Monish Patolawala : You're breaking up a little bit, Steve, but I think I got your question as what's the underlying leverage, and I would tell you it's a little hard for me to X everything out from a restructuring perspective. X out organic volume price raw and then give you a leverage. I would just tell you when you look at the bridge that we have given you, we did see volume growth, but that was offset by the productivity from global supply chain, as well as our growth in productivity and increased litigation costs. And you can see that hurt us 1.4% on that productivity basis. That's the way I look at it Steve, it's very hard and I think it would be unfair for me to just X everything out and then tell you leverage is good because I don't think that's the way we look at it. Because for me it's -- ultimately it's the all-in, what I give you versus Xing stuff out. Steve Tusa : Right. I guess, is there a reason why you wouldn't be able to convert more normally in '22? I guess, assuming these things stabilize, is this business still a 35% core incremental margin business? Monish Patolawala : I would say so, Steve, I think it's a gain. You have to go back to all thing s being equal. Monish Patolawala : Yes, it's a 30 to 40% leverage business and I don't see that change. But I think it will come down to what does supply chain trends look like in 2022. You've seen not just us, but many of our peers as well as other people have said supply chain constraints go into 2022. But I think long term, as Mike has mentioned, and I have said, we are very confident we can grow about the macro. We can get margin expansion and we can continue to have strong cash. So all those, it's -- I think it's just a short uncertain time that we'll have to just see how supply chain self -- plays itself. Steve Tusa : Yeah. Yeah, very appreciated. Okay. Thanks. Thanks [ inaudible 01 :02:44] Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Bruce Jermeland : Hey John. Everyone: Hi, John. John Walsh : Maybe just first question around the restructuring,you used the term on track,,but I just wanted to confirm the numbers here. I mean, the prior program was 275 million in Costs, 225 million of savings, and then now you've -- you've taken it obviously up higher here. How do we think of -- what is that -- is that you mean by on track, that's like an 82% conversion on the savings and on the new actions, how do we think about the payback on those? Monish Patolawala : So I'll reiterate and I'm -- our program was going to cost somewhere between 250 to 300 and benefits of somewhere between 200 and 250. What we have looked -- what I said in this, in my prepared remarks was year-to-date we have spent 240 million against the 250 to 300 and we are updating that from 250 to 300 to 300 to 325 and be largely expect the program to be initiated by the end of 1Q '22.  On the benefit side, we are -- we had set 200 to 250 with all the actions that we have taken. We see ourselves at the higher end of that range in between the 225 and the 250, but half of it that's already shown up or will show up for this year in '21 by the time we're done with the fourth quarter. And the balance would show up in '22. Bruce Jermeland : Hey, John I just want to clarify one thing. Monish said year-to-date we've had $240 million of charges -- Monish Patolawala : Charges, sorry, Bruce Jermeland : That's actually a 140 last year in Q4 and 100 million year-to-date this year? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Sorry. Program to-date. Bruce Jermeland : Yeah. Monish Patolawala : And as you know, John, we don't remove restructuring charges from our results and that's all included in the numbers we report. So we don't adjust for that. John Walsh : Yes, no. Thank you for the [Indiscernible] extra details there. And then maybe just as a follow-up here, lot of questions around supply chain I think we're all following the semi shortages, etc.. But 3M, you also mentioned like probably propylene and some other supply chains that a little bit more ancillary to kind of semi and some of the things we might be tracking day-to-day. I'm assuming there was some impact there from either hurricanes first majeur, etc. Can you maybe just help us understand what you're seeing in that part of your supply chain? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So -- John Walsh : How long the duration of that might be. Monish Patolawala : So we're seeing polypropylene ethylene resins, all of the ones are the companies I mentioned seeing inflation. Many of these accrued better videos. They're not perfectly tied to the price of crude, but you can see where crude is going. So there's derivatives. T hey all have got impacted all the way in February, but the hurricane that happened. And then I would say the global supply chains have further put pressure on it for the material flow across the globe. And that makes it harder for you to buy material only in certain locations. And just -- I would, if my memory is right, on polypropylene and ethylene, we saw actually a jump in August. We've seen it come down a little bit in September.  But that's again, it's demand-supply equation there, but it's all goes back to Hurricane Ida that happened in February. And then the demand from the pandemic also increased the need for the product and all that put together, Mike used the word convergence, has driven some of the pressures on the chemical side of the house. John Walsh : Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. Monish Patolawala : Thanks, John. Mike Roman : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Everyone: Morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Maybe an update on how you're thinking about cash deployment at this point. I think we all understand your priorities and they start with organic investments. But at what point do you ramp up purchases for instance, if your stock continues to languish at [Indiscernible], at what point do you think you've gone far enough into a salary integration that 3M might be better equipped to make a larger deal again? Monish Patolawala : Again, just I -- and my apologies, Andy, I am just going to reiterate our capital allocation priorities just so that everyone's on the same page. Our first priority is always go organic. We just see it's the best use of our capital, best return, as you can see, the not afraid to deploy capital. We've done that in 2020, We're continuing do that in '21, which is investing in growth, productivity, and sustainability.  We were going to spend $1.8 to $2 billion this year, but with some office supply chain constraints, it's down to 1.5 to 1.6, but we still believe in the long-term growth, and so we're going to keep investing in that. As Mike had announced early in the year, we also announced a billion dollars to improve -- for our sustainability efforts.  That's going to be spend over the next 20 years, but it's front-end loaded, so that's the second piece on organic investment. Dividend is our second priority, important for our shareholders. So that's a priority that we clearly are focused on. Our third priority is M&A, and you're right that we are integrating Acelity and the team's doing a very nice job by integrating Acelity into our business. At the same time, we have tons of ideas and we have a pipeline that we'll execute when we see that we get a target that we believe can add value to our shareholders at the same time, it's things that we believe that, we can add value to the target too, by using some of the strengths that we have, which is our brand, our global capability, our employee base our material science capability, etc. So that's our third and we always have an active pipeline.  And then the last one, a share buyback. You've seen, we've now done 1.3 billion for the year. We did 527, that's the last priority for us from a deployment of capital perspective. But depending on the stock price and how much cash we generate, we clearly will look at that too. Overall, I would just save and I look at net debt to EBITDA leverage, which is at approximately 1.3. At that point, it gives me a lot of financial strength and optionality.  It gives 3M a lot of financial strength and optionality. So depending on what opportunities we see, we won't hesitate to deploy capital because, as Mike mentioned, even some of the platforms that we've talked about, all of them are GDP plus growth platform. So that's an area we would love to keep investing in. Andrew Kaplowitz : Many sets [Indiscernible] Could you give us a little more color on what's going on in your Healthcare business in terms of margin. I think margin performance is relatively doing year-over-year,at least versus your other segments.  So how much is the Saudi integration helping? Is it a mix of your businesses such as oral care outperforming that's helping margin. And how are you thinking about margin trajectory in that business moving forward? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So for healthcare, I also look at EBITDA, if that helps, Andy. I think year-to-date, we are approximately 31% on an EBITDA basis. The team most and team have done a really nice job of continuing to drive margin. We increased margin 70 basis points in the third quarter. I would say it's a performance all around the Oral Care business and the snapback has definitely helped. It helps us on a volume, it helps us on leverage with the volume and the factories. The MSD business, if you exclude the disposable respirator decline, grew very nicely in the second quarter and MSD's [ inaudible 01 :11:00] Acelity was in there too.  Acelity was impacted in the third quarter by low elective procedures, but the integration is going well, we're continuing to find synergies between the cross-selling that we can do with our wound care business and facility or existing wound care business and facility. So we are very happy with our progress. But in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do to drive growth and margin and most in team are very focused on continuing to do that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate in Monish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Thanks for fitting me in to everybody Everyone : [Indiscernible] Joe Ritchie : Maybe just on the price cost discussion, I haven't covered you guys for a while.It's rare to see that price cost equation negative,the question I have is, do you think we're at the peak of pain that a 140 basis points impact on price costs? And then my follow-on to that, Monish, you talked about some of your business being going through contracts. I'm just curious, what portion of your business is tougher to re-price in this environment? Monish Patolawala : So to answer your first question, we have made progress on price. You saw us going from 10 basis points to 140. And if you recall, Joe, we had said that, you will see this ramp through the year, because we take a very methodical approach to driving price across the multiple geographies and the channels, we have. We should continue to see progress in the fourth quarter as these price actions that we've taken in the third quarter continue to take hold. I think the big issue that we have seen as inflation is coming faster than anybody thought. And so the team has continuously done what it can to drive price increases to the question that was even asked earlier, our goal is to get to neutral of price and all. But I think it'll all depend on how inflation goes. But the team knows how to drive price, the team drives a lot of innovation that also helps from a price increase perspective. So all that put together teams working it pretty hard. Joe Ritchie : And the question on the contract,in being able to reprice some of your contract,you have some kind of benchmark for us on what portion is a little bit tougher to reprice in the environment? Monish Patolawala : Yes. Listen, all price increases we work with our customers. We have contracts with many of our customers, in some cases we get 90 to a 120 days notice. In some cases, these are longer contracts that we worked through. And then we have spec in businesses that we work directly with the OEM. So put all that together, that's how we look at this. So it's hard for me to give you one number because, pick a day and I think you'll have a different dollar of contract on the contract quote and quote. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Monish Patolawala : Thanks too Mike Roman : Thanks too Operator : [Operator Instructions] Bruce Jermeland : To wrap up, our team is performing well in a challenging environment, delivering broad-based growth, good margins, and strong cash flow. We will stay focused on managing supply chain constraints, investing in attractive market trends to drive our growth and creating greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 25, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, I would like to announce our next two investor events. On the morning of February 14, we will be having a Virtual Investor Meeting where we will be providing a near-term strategic update, along with our 2022 guidance. Also, please mark your calendars for our first quarter earnings conference call, which will take place on Tuesday, April 26. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight a couple of presentation changes we are making in 2022 to simplify our financial reporting and increase understanding of our performance. These changes are a result of discussions we have had with many of you over the last few years, along with recent benchmarking work that we have done. First, we recognize that dual credit reporting has presented some challenges, for example, having a clear understanding of the impact of disposable respirator performance over the past 2 years on our segment results, particularly Safety and Industrial and Healthcare. Therefore, we have decided to eliminate dual credit reporting and will no longer report dual credit within our business segments starting in Q1 2022. We will provide a Form 8-K ahead of our February 14 meeting with updated history for the past 3 years reflecting this change. And second, we will be providing organic sales change components in aggregate as opposed to reporting separate volume and price components. With this change, we will also be updating the descriptor to organic sales versus organic local currency sales. Please note, this change will be reflected in our 2021 Form 10-K filing. We remain committed to providing strong transparency of reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to Slide 4 and I will now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, closing out a strong year as we focused on serving customers in a dynamic external environment. Our revenue in the quarter finished better than we expected across all businesses, including an increase in respirator demand due to the impact from the Omicron variant. Organic growth company-wide was 1% on top of 6% in last year\u2019s Q4, with earnings of $2.31 per share driven by a good December, strong execution and a lower than anticipated tax rate. I am pleased with how we effectively manage production operations to meet customer demand despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges that are impacting many companies. While focusing on customers, we also saw good benefits from our actions to drive productivity, improve yields and control costs, which helped offset the margin impact of supply chain disruptions, inflation and COVID-19. In addition, our selling price actions continued to gain traction with a year-on-year increase of 2.6% in Q4 versus 1.4% in Q3. We expect this to be a tailwind for the full year in 2022. Overall, demand remains strong across our market leading businesses and we are continuing to prioritize growth investments in large attractive markets. We also took actions to strengthen our portfolio and advance our commitment to sustainability. I will highlight examples of our progress later in the call. In summary, we delivered a good finish to the year and are well positioned to drive growth in 2022. As Bruce noted, we will provide full year guidance along with strategic updates from our business leaders at our February 14 meeting. Monish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Mike and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. Looking back on the fourth quarter, the 3M team continued to manage through a challenging environment. As Mike noted, revenues for December were better than previously expected across all the businesses, including disposable respirators as the Omicron variant increased near-term demand. Though manufacturing, raw materials and logistic challenges persisted throughout the quarter, the 3M team executed well by driving operating rigor and managing costs while continuing to invest in the business. Turning to the fourth quarter financial results, sales were $8.6 billion, up 0.3% year-on-year or an increase of 1.3% on an organic local currency basis against our toughest quarterly comparison last year. Operating income was $1.6 billion with operating margins of 18.8% and earnings per share of $2.31. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q4 last year. The biggest impact to fourth quarter results was the ongoing effects from the well-known global supply chain, raw materials and logistics challenges, which persisted throughout the fourth quarter. Our enterprise operations teams continue to work tirelessly through ever evolving changes in customer demand, while navigating these challenges to keep our factories running, serve our customers and protect the health and safety of our employees. We continue to experience significant productivity headwinds in our factories due to shorter production runs and more frequent production changeovers throughout the quarter as we focused on serving our customers. As forecasted at the start of last year, we also had higher year-on-year compensation and benefits costs. These impacts were partially offset through strong spending discipline along with benefits from restructuring and lower legal-related expenses versus last year\u2019s Q4. We also continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets, including automotive, home improvement, safety, healthcare and electronics. All-in, these impacts lowered operating margins by 2.4 percentage points and earnings per share by $0.33 year-on-year. Moving to price and raw materials, as expected, our selling price actions continue to gain traction as we went through the quarter. On a year-on-year perspective, Q4 selling prices increased 260 basis points as compared to 140 basis points in Q3 and 10 basis points in Q2. In dollar terms, higher year-on-year selling prices offset raw material and logistics cost inflation in Q4, which resulted in an increase in earnings of $0.03, however, remained a headwind of 20 basis points to operating margins. Next, foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, was a headwind of 10 basis points to margins and $0.04 per share year-on-year. There were three other non-operating items that impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, a reduction in other expenses resulted in a $0.10 earnings benefit. This included a $0.06 benefit from non-operating pension, which was similar to prior quarters. We also have been proactively managing our debt portfolio, including the early redemption of $1.5 billion, which helped drive a $0.04 benefit year-on-year from lower net interest expense. Second, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.12 benefit to earnings per share. Our Q4 tax rate was benefited by geographic income mix and favorable adjustments related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. And for the full year, our tax rate was 17.8%. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1% versus Q4 last year, increasing per share earnings by $0.02. Please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.5 billion or down 30% year-on-year, with conversion of 110%. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $6 billion, with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 101%. The decline in our Q4 year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven primarily by lower non-cash legal and restructuring expenses versus Q4 last year, along with higher litigation-related payments and CapEx investments which was partially offset by improvements in working capital velocity. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $556 million, up $134 million year-on-year and $213 million sequentially as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking at the full year, capital expenditures totaled $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $848 million and share repurchases of $938 million. For the full year, we returned $5.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to maintain a strong capital structure. We ended the year with $4.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion or 8% versus year end 2020. As a result, we exited the year with net debt to EBITDA of 1.4x. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to Slide 7, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted an organic sales decline of 1.3% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result included a disposable respirator sales decline of approximately $110 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial\u2019s Q4 organic growth by nearly 4 percentage points. Our personal safety business declined mid-teens organically versus last year\u2019s 40% pandemic-driven comparison. Looking ahead, we anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as COVID-related impacts continue to evolve. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in closure and masking. In addition, the abrasives business was up high single-digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and electrical markets were each up mid single-digits. Automotive aftermarket was flat, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year. Safety and Industrial\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $543 million, down 22% versus last year. Operating margin was 17.7%, down 440 basis points versus Q4 last year. Year-on-year operating margin performance was impacted by a decline in sales volumes, higher raw materials, logistics and litigation-related costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with last year\u2019s gain on sale of property. Partially offsetting these impacts were selling price increases, strong spending discipline, net benefits from restructuring and a smaller increase to our respirator mask reserve. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which declined slightly on an organic basis due to the continued impact of the semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our auto OEM business was down mid-teens organically year-on-year compared to the 13% decline in global car and light truck builds. As we mentioned last quarter, we experienced an increase in channel inventory levels with the tier suppliers in Q3 as auto OEM production volumes decelerated from 18.5 million builds in Q2 to 16.3 million in Q3. During the fourth quarter, OEM production volumes increased to 20.2 million builds or up over 20% sequentially. This sequential increase in build activity drove a reduction of channel inventory levels with the tier suppliers during the quarter, which negatively impacted Q4 organic growth for our automotive business by approximately 10 percentage points. For the full year, our auto OEM business was up low double-digits as compared to global car and light truck builds growth of 2%. Throughout the year, we continued our track record of success of winning with our customers and gaining penetration on new internal combustion and electric vehicle platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single-digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions grew low double-digits, advanced material was up high single-digits, while transportation safety declined high single-digits. Fourth quarter operating income was $406 million, down 15% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.6%, down 270 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with an increase in comp and benefits costs. These year-on-year headwinds were partially offset by increases in selling price, strong spending discipline and net benefits from restructuring actions. Turning to our Healthcare business, which posted a fourth quarter organic sales increase of 1.6%. This result included a nearly 4 percentage point drag from the year-on-year sales decline in disposable respirators. Our medical solutions business declined low single-digits organically, which included a 6 percentage point impact from the year-on-year sales decline in disposable respirators. Fourth quarter elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels, which was similar to Q3 and last year\u2019s Q4. Sales in our oral care business grew low single-digits year-on-year as patient visits continue to be near pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased high single-digits year-on-year, with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew mid single-digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management and clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased high single-digits despite continued COVID-related impacts at the global hospitality industry. In December, we announced the planned separation of this business, which will be combined with Neogen. As disclosed in the December press release, we expect the transaction to close by the end of Q3 of this year. Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $536 million, down 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.6%, down 50 basis points. Year-on-year, operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity, compensation and benefits costs and food safety deal-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by benefits from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and restructuring actions. For the quarter and full year, Healthcare\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margins were strong, coming in at nearly 31%. Lastly, our consumer business finished out the year strong, with organic growth of 4.9% year-on-year on top of last year\u2019s 10% comparison. Our home improvement business continued to perform well, up low single-digits on top of last year\u2019s strong double-digit comp. This business continued to deliver strong growth with our home improvement retail customers in our category leading Filtrete, Command and Scotch-Blue brands. Stationery and office, along with the consumer health and safety business, each grew low double-digits organically in Q4 as both of these businesses continue to lap last year\u2019s COVID-related comparisons. The holiday season demand drove strong growth for our Scotch branded products during the quarter. We also posted strong growth in Post-it branded products despite workplace reopenings being pushed out due to the resurgence of COVID cases. And finally, our Home Care business was up low single-digits versus last year\u2019s strong COVID-driven comparison. During the quarter, we took a small portfolio action to divest our flow care business in Europe, which is expected to close in Q1. Consumer\u2019s operating income was $316 million, flat compared to last year. Operating margins were 21.4%, down 100 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased compensation and benefit costs. These impacts were partially offset by leverage on sales growth, which included good price performance, strong spending discipline and net benefits from restructuring actions. That concludes my remarks for the fourth quarter. Before I turn it back over to Mike to recap the year, I would like to make a few comments reflecting on our operating performance this past year. The macro environment in 2021 was defined by strong, but fluid end markets, semiconductor constraints, supply chain and logistics challenges, along with ever evolving impacts from COVID-19, particularly on the global healthcare industry. These dynamics were further compounded by winter storm Uri in mid-February, which led to significant disruptions to raw material supply and logistics availability, which further disrupted global supply chains. All of these factors collectively helped contribute to broad-based and accelerating inflationary pressures throughout the year. Against this backdrop, the 3M team kept a relentless focus on serving customers, ensured continuity of raw material supply, managed ever changing manufacturing production plans, navigated logistic constraints and delivered strong full year organic growth of 9%, with all business segments posting high single-digit growth. We also worked hard to raise selling prices, control spending and drive improvements in operating rigor through daily management, leveraging data and data analytics, while continuing to execute on our restructuring actions. These actions, combined with strong organic growth, helped to deliver full year operating margins of 20.8% or down 50 basis points year-on-year on an adjusted basis. This result included an 80 basis point headwind from raw materials and logistics inflation net of selling price actions, along with increased spending to advance our sustainability efforts and higher legal-related expenses. In addition, we continue to focus on working capital improvement, which helped contribute to another year of robust adjusted free cash flow coming in at $6 billion. I want to thank the 3M employees for delivering for our customers and shareholders in a very uncertain and fluid environment. I also want to take a moment to personally thank our customers and suppliers for putting their trust and confidence in us and for maintaining strong and close partnerships that helped us navigate the challenges of the past year. We made good progress in 2021 and are well positioned for 2022. And in the spirit of continuous improvement, there is always more we can do and will do. With that, please turn to Slide 8. And I will turn it back over to Mike for his recap of 2021. Mike Roman : Thank you, Monish. As I look back at 2021, I am proud of our team and our performance. Our results demonstrated the strength of the 3M model and our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability advanced our company. In the face of an uncertain environment, we delivered strong organic growth of 9%, with strength across all business groups, along with margins of 21%. This drove a 14% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results exceeded our original guidance that we communicated in January of 2021 and recent updates to that guidance. We generated robust free cash flow of $6 billion with an adjusted conversion rate of 101%, enabling us to invest in the business, reduce net debt by $1 billion and return significant cash to shareholders. All in, 3M returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and 2021 marked our 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases. We continue to help the world respond to COVID-19 with 2.3 billion respirators distributed last year for a total of 4.3 billion since the onset of the pandemic, while engaging with governments on how to prepare for future emergencies. We stepped up our commitments to ESG, including sustainability as we made progress on new goals to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water use, improve water quality and reduce plastics. As part of our ongoing sustainability commitments, we proactively manage PFAS and deploy capital to make our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. As one example, we are on track to complete a new water filtration system in Cordova, Illinois by the end of 2022. In Zwijndrecht, Belgium, we installed and activated a treatment system last month to reduce PFAS discharges by up to 90%. This is part of a \u20ac125 million commitment to improve water quality and support the local community. As disclosed in our 8-K in November, we continue to work with local authorities related to a safety measure that shut down certain operations in Zwijndrecht. We are also appealing and discussing with local authorities a new change to our wastewater discharge permit that if implemented, could have a material impact and potentially interrupt production at the entire site, impacting customers and the supply of material to other 3M factories. We are actively working to address current and future potential impacts, and we will update you as appropriate. With respect to litigation, we reached settlements last year in certain PFAS cases and continue to vigorously defend ourselves on combat arms. As always, we encourage you to read our SEC filings for updates on these matters. As we advance our ESG priorities, we also continue to take actions to improve diversity, equity and inclusion. This includes multiple programs to make STEM education more available to underrepresented groups and achieve our goal to deliver 5 million learning experiences. Our businesses have also made commitments. Safety and Industrial, for example, is focusing on access to skilled trades, and we are increasing transparency through an annual diversity, equity and inclusion report. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term growth and value creation. We are innovating faster and differently, including new ways to collaborate with customers and partners virtually, while investing $3.6 billion in the combination of R&D and CapEx to strengthen 3M for the future. To make the most of long-term growth opportunities, we also continue to prioritize investments in large, fast-growing areas like automotive, home improvement, safety, healthcare and electronics. In 2021, for example, our automotive electrification platform grew 30% organically, and our biopharma business grew 26%. Our home improvement business grew 12% on top of 13% growth in 2020, driven by iconic brands, including our Command damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete home filtration products. To accelerate our ability to meet increasing demand for Command and Filtrete, last week, we announced a nearly $500 million investment to expand our operations in Clinton, Tennessee, adding nearly 600 manufacturing jobs by 2025. We look forward to sharing more about how we are capitalizing on growth trends and winning in these markets at our February meeting. Last year, we also continued to reposition our portfolio to maximize value across the enterprise, including an agreement to divest and combine our food safety business with Neogen, creating a global leader that is well positioned to capture long-term profitable growth. We continue to make progress in transforming 3M, accelerating our digital capabilities and expanding our use of data and analytics to better serve customers and improve our operational agility and efficiency. This includes the ongoing deployment of our ERP system, which went live in Japan in Q4 and also moving more than 60% of our enterprise applications and global data center infrastructure to the cloud, while streamlining our business group-led operating model. To help our people be at their best, we also introduced new employee work models rooted in flexibility and trust, along with investments to support their health and well-being. As we enter 2022, I\u2019m confident we will continue to grow our businesses, improve our operational performance and find new ways to apply science to improve lives, delivering for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders who have placed their trust in us. We are building a stronger 3M, and I want to thank our 95,000 employees for their contributions, including the 50,000 people in our factories who continue to show up day in and day out to make a difference. That wraps up our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. I wasn\u2019t expecting the first question. Good morning. Thanks for that. So as much upside to your early December guidance, Monish, you called out a number of factors, but you didn\u2019t call out N95, which given all the talk we\u2019ve got from the federal government about free masks and the new guidance and I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing from that side of the business given all the commentary we\u2019ve seen? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So Nigel, I would say when we gave you the guidance in December, at that time, we had not seen the pickup of N95s. And one of the factors that made us deliver better than what we thought in December was the pickup of the respirator business. We came in $40 million better than what we had originally predicted. So we have seen that pickup. But I would still say it\u2019s volatile. We will see how this plays itself out. We are pleased with the partnership that we have with the federal government right now as regards to this. We\u2019ve had a lot of dialogue with them. And as things evolve, we will keep you posted. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just \u2013 I know you\u2019re going to give guidance on Feb 14. But just curious, just given the lots of moving parts of the margin line, just wondering how we think about the takeoff point into 2022, specifically 1Q \u201822. Normal seasonality would have you up slightly from 4Q. Just wondering how you think about that. And have we seen the peak of the inflation curve at this point? Monish Patolawala : Have we seen the peak, I\u2019m sorry, of what? Mike Roman : Inflation. Nigel Coe : Of inflation curve. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I\u2019ll start with that first comment, Nigel. And that\u2019s an item that we constantly keep watching and debating. As you know, we\u2019ve tried to fine-tune our analysis as much as we can on inflation. So what we saw exiting December was the pace of inflation slowed down versus the prior months. It\u2019s still inflationary, but we saw the pace slow down. And I think that\u2019s a positive. But again, it will depend on how winter plays itself out, it depends on logistics, etcetera, and whether the ports get uncongested. Just on data points and your other points on margin, etcetera, things to keep in mind as you get into 1Q \u201822. First of all, from an inflation perspective, you\u2019re going to find not just us, but most companies have the highest \u2013 the toughest comp because if you remember, in the first quarter of last \u2013 of \u201821, there wasn\u2019t as much inflation. We started seeing it in March and then it accelerated in April onwards. So I would factor that one in first. The second, I would say, is COVID uncertainty. You brought up the respirator demand, but there are other impacts also depending on what happens with COVID, labor shortages that we are seeing from our customers. We are seeing it in our own factories. Our vendors, I\u2019m sure, are facing it, too. So that\u2019s something we will have to watch. The third one is we are going to continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. So I would say that\u2019s an area as we continue to see it, we\u2019re going to keep investing, especially in the areas Mike has already talked about. I would say we continue to see a strong market. We saw it in the fourth quarter. We are seeing it right now. And I think 2022 will continue to remain a strong market. The team has done a marvelous job in driving price. Price has gone up from 0.1% to 1.4% to 2.6%. Mike had talked about that also in his opening remarks that we see that to be a tailwind. Team has done a good job on executing on restructuring so there is approximately $70 million of carryover of restructuring benefits for the year. Auto and electric growth, right now, sequentially from a build rate is showing flat for the year of 2022. It\u2019s a 9% increase. I think the chip shortage and where that ends up will have an impact on the auto business. Healthcare elective procedures came in at 90%. There are predictions that says they should be at 100% by Q4 2022. From our end, we are going to continue driving operating rigor. We\u2019re going to continue to drive margin expansion, as we have said before. We will also have to watch litigation costs and see where that goes with all the cases that are on. And then Mike mentioned about Zwijndrecht, and we\u2019re working with the authorities in Belgium for our factory, and we will have to see the impact and when we can start up production in some of those areas that are currently shut down. So all that put together, I would say, again, we are well positioned, and I know it\u2019s a long answer to your question, Nigel, but I just wanted to give you a full framework. We are well positioned for 2022. We closed Q4 pretty well, and we hope to continue that momentum into 2022. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks for the details. I will leave there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. A couple here from me. First, just \u2013 I was wondering if you could level set us actually now on the actual size of the respirator business. I think we were $600 million pre-COVID. I feel like we\u2019re in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range. But could you put a finer point on where we stand at the end of 2021? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So Jeff, it\u2019s $1.5 billion is what we did in 2021. It was $600 million in \u201819, $1.4 billion in 2020 and $1.5 billion in 2021. If you look at it quarter over \u2013 sequentially, we were down and we were also down $110 million versus Q4 of 2020. We believe that the peak was Q1 of 2021. And then depending on how it goes, but we believe in 2022, disposable respirator demand is going to be lower than what we had in 2021. Jeff Sprague : I know you\u2019re going to reserve your guidance for next month, but you did essentially get the price cost neutrality in the quarter, right, a little negative on margins, a little positive on EPS. Is it your view that, that gets better over the course of the year? And as you think about kind of carryover price, I understand there is a ton of variables in that. But directionally, I just wonder if you could give us your preliminary thoughts on how that tracks for the year. Monish Patolawala : Yes, Jeff, I think we are working through that. But just as Mike mentioned, pricing will continue to remain a tailwind for 2022. Inflation, I think we will have to watch how the different factors play out back to raw material logistics. I think what you\u2019re going to see is you\u2019re going to see some of your primary feedstocks start stabilizing, which we saw in December. But you are going to see specialty feedstock starting to get more expensive. We are seeing inflation has gone downstream now. So you\u2019re seeing it in much more places than you had seen it before. I think what\u2019s also going to impact inflation is what happens with the labor pool and what goes on there. And then as long as the ports can start getting uncongested, I think you\u2019re going to see logistics costs come down. If commercial airline capacity comes back in, you\u2019re going to start seeing air freight start coming down. So we are watching all of that. I would say first half in talking to people, our own analysis, etcetera, I think the first half is going to be tougher than the second half of 2022 when it comes to inflation. First half part of it is, as I mentioned, we are still seeing sequential increases, but slower. So that\u2019s good. But you\u2019re going to start facing last year\u2019s comp when it comes to inflation. And I think that\u2019s going to impact us. So I think we are well positioned and as I\u2019ve told you before, the team has gone after price. We are managing a price raw equation as best we can, and we\u2019re prepared to act as the situation evolves. Jeff Sprague : And then just lastly for me, if I could. Mike, I think you made a comment about the dramatically reducing PFAS discharges. Perhaps this is my bad, but I didn\u2019t know you were still discharging PFAS in places. Is this just at a single location? Or is this still an issue that you\u2019re addressing in multiple locations? Mike Roman : Yes, Jeff, this was part of our \u2013 really following through on what we committed to do and we announced back at the beginning of 2021 to make an investment in reducing the water use in our factories, improving the water quality of our largest facilities. And part of that is this discharge \u2013 controlling discharges, reducing that as part of that investment. And that includes what \u2013 PFAS is a broad category of chemistries. We\u2019ve talked about how we exited now almost 2 decades ago, the PFOA, PFOS chemistries, which are a part of a lot of the discussions in PFAS, but there are other PFAS chemistries that are used in chemical manufacturing and generally in some of our sites. And that was the focus. I mean, we\u2019re always in compliance with the regulations that are on our plants. This is a chance to step forward and do even more and reduce further. And that was what I talked about with Zwijndrecht. This is reducing further below our requirements at the time, our additional \u2013 improving the water quality even further. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Okay. Good morning, everybody. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Scott. Mike Roman : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question on price a little bit, are prices up again in January, meaning did you have a January 1 price increase or did you implement your last big price increase in 4Q? Monish Patolawala : So we\u2019ve implemented big price increases in 4Q. But again, Scott, as we have said, a lot of these were pretty coordinated across different geographies, different markets. So, to the extent we see the need that we have to do in 1Q, we will do the same on 2022, we will do the same. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And then this Belgium situation, can you give us a little bit of color on how material \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve had a couple \u2013 couple of your disclosure \u2013 previous disclosure said you can\u2019t measure the materiality, but you\u2019ve had a couple of months now. I mean, can you supply out of other factories and meet demand? How disruptive is this? And should we \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a fancy way of saying, should we build this into our models and some sort of a headwind in 2022? Or do you feel like you\u2019re going to have some remediation here? Mike Roman : Yes, Scott, back to the comments I made in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re in the middle of this right now. We continue to work with the local authorities. We\u2019re appealing and discussing the change in our wastewater discharge permit there. It could have a material impact and potentially in production at the site. So that\u2019s something we wanted to be clear on. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of it, and I don\u2019t really want to speculate at this point on what it will ultimately mean. This is a priority for us. We have our best people working on it, actively working the problem, and we will update as appropriate as we go forward here as we work through it. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck, Mike. Thank you. Mike Roman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Hi, good morning, everyone. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Joe. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So I know we will get more details in mid-February. But I guess maybe just kind of thinking about the margin trajectory for both Safety and Industrial and for Transportation and Electronics both of those segments have been hit pretty hard the last couple of quarters. And I\u2019m just curious, as you kind of think through the beginning part of 2022, I mean, should we continue to expect the same type of headwinds or are there certain things that you would call out, perhaps the litigation costs not recurring into 2022 that could be potential tailwinds to margins in the early part of the year? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Joe, as you said, we will give you more guidance as we go through. But just to answer your question more specifically, I would say a couple of things, and I\u2019ve said that before, too, volume has the biggest impact for us on a margin, whether it\u2019s SI BGT, BG healthcare or CBG. I think we will have to see what 1Q volume turns out to be, what headwinds we have or tailwinds. When you think about just the trends that those two businesses are seeing, overall GDP and IPI is going to be positive for 2022. I think it\u2019s volatile in the first quarter and the second quarter and what that turns out. So that will determine industrial activity. On an auto build, it is flat to down sequentially, so \u2013 and it\u2019s flat to down on a year-over-year basis, too. So that will have an impact on TEBG, that, of course, then we will have to see smartphone shipments. So that\u2019s the macroeconomic environment. On our own, you\u2019ve seen the team\u2019s done a good job of raising price. So we have seen price go up sequentially through the quarter. And so you should see that price hold or get better. Inflation is another area that, again, I think we will face a very tough comp from last year. We had very little inflation in the first quarter of last year. So you are \u2013 on a year-over-year basis, Joe, going to face that comp. And then the third piece is on litigation. As we have told you we are actively working and defending ourselves and to combat our cases. It\u2019s a little \u2013 right now, I don\u2019t know where that goes, and we will keep doing what\u2019s right to keep defending ourselves and see where those expenses land. So I think this is the best I can give you at this moment, a little bit of macroeconomic, some of our stuff. And then internally, the last piece before I turn it back to you for another question, is from driving supply chain efficiency, driving our factories, improving rigor, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to keep doing. We have done it. We will keep doing it. So that should help. And then supply chain availability or the manufacturing productivity impacts that we\u2019ve had in the last two quarters, which has impacted SIBG and TEBG a lot, we will have to see how the material flows. Again, December turned out to be better and you saw that come through from a leverage perspective, which goes back to the comment that volumes as the best leverage. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s super helpful, thank you, Monish. And then just maybe my quick follow-on, just you mentioned the combat arms and clearly PFAS being just an important part of the story here for investors. I\u2019m just curious, just from a timeline perspective, as you think about 2022, are there certain dates that we should be thinking about or penciling in, just to be paying close attention to any type of progress or resolution on either of those two items? Mike Roman : Yes, Joe, we try to keep you updated even in these calls on what\u2019s coming next. And we don\u2019t have any specific trials coming up in PFAS. The next one is related to the MDL, which we\u2019re expecting in 2023. There is, as you know, EPA is working on a management plan and there is a strategic road map through the President Biden\u2019s administration. So we\u2019re \u2013 we will be watching that and updating you as we learn more around that. Related to combat arms, just frame this up. We have great respect for the brave men and women of the military protectors around the world. And we have a long partnership here. We\u2019ve been providing products and continue to provide products in the matter with the combat arms, we believe our product was safe and effective in its use, and we\u2019re vigorously defending ourselves. And we\u2019ve been working through these bellwether trials. We\u2019ve had 10 trials so far, five of those were in our favor. 8 actually were dismissed in addition to the 10 trials we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019re in the middle of those bellwether. So there is another six bellwethers planned for 2022. And we will update you as we go through that and we will update you as appropriate. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe the first question on sort of cash flow and capital deployment, so, cash flow was down double-digits in Q4 and the full year and understood the sort of abnormal base in 2020. But how should we think about cash flow for this year? How quickly do we get sort of working capital under control? And also in terms of the sort of disbursement of cash, you paid out around 90% or 95% of free cash flow last year to shareholders. Do we expect sort of similar type approach in \u201822? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, I will start, Julian, with just reminding you, from a capital allocation perspective, and I will just \u2013 for everyone\u2019s benefit, our first is always organic growth where we believe we will get the best return. You saw us putting in $1.6 billion from a CapEx perspective in 2021. For 2022 and beyond, we are going to continue to invest in growth. You have seen us make the big announcement in Clinton. It\u2019s $0.5 billion of investment that we are going to put over the next couple of years. We also have given you our goal on sustainability where we plan to spend $1 billion, part of it CapEx, OpEx, which is front-end loaded. Third, as we had talked about on CapEx, we had mentioned during our earnings call as well as other updates throughout the quarter, our plan was to spend $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We were not able to, unfortunately, because of raw material and labor availability. So, to the extent that we have good programs out there, we are going to keep doing that. So, that\u2019s organic growth. Second is, from a dividend perspective, we know it\u2019s an important piece for our shareholders. We are going to continue to do that. Mike mentioned it was the 63rd year in 2021 that we increased dividend. So, we will see where 2022 goes with that. Third is M&A and portfolio. We have an active pipeline, and we are always looking for good businesses that can help us \u2013 that we can add value as well as the business that we acquire can add value to 3M and the shareholders. And then the last piece is share buyback, which we have done. And we stepped up in Q4, and we had mentioned that during our earnings call as well, I think \u2013 I am sorry, and certain updates in the quarter, where we said the stock was attractive, and we stepped into it, and that\u2019s what we did in Q4. Talking specifically about working capital, working capital continues to remain a big priority for us, doing data and data analytics. And if you actually see and do the math, Julian, and you do cash conversion cycle in Q4 of 2020 versus Q4 of 2021, you are actually going to see that the velocity of working capital went up. The revenue was higher in total for 2021. So therefore, you do see the drag on working capital. And at the same time, if you further split working capital up inventory is where with all the supply chain challenges, that\u2019s an area that the team has done a nice job of managing the inventory, but that\u2019s where you have much more opportunity as supply stabilizes. So, that\u2019s an area I would say we are going to continue driving cash. There is a lot of opportunity to keep giving strong cash. We generated $6 billion and then from a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, we are down to 1.4 versus when I started 18 months ago, we were at close to 2.3, 2.4. So, the team has done a really nice job of driving cash and working capital is a big piece of it. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, it feels a long time ago, but I suppose it was fairly recent, the food safety divestment as sort of broad perspective on the portfolio. The fact that it was one of the 12 priority growth platforms at the company and is still being divested, does that tell us at least on the outside, one could interpret that as meaning that there is a much broader sort of remit around potential divestments at 3M, if you are even willing to sell a priority growth business? Is that a sort of reasonable interpretation? Mike Roman : Yes, Julian, I would say, first, it reinforces what we have been talking about. Our portfolio strategy is actively continuously evaluating our portfolio. We do that to make decisions on where we invest organically, more attractive markets that can leverage 3M\u2019s capabilities, fundamental strengths. We look at acquisitions that can complement what we do organically and when integrated into 3M, give us attractive markets that can add value in greater than some of the parts of the two businesses. We also are looking how to maximize value all the time. And that is everything from managing our businesses differently to up to and including divestitures. And we have done a number of those over time where we saw better owners or greater value to be really achieved through the divestiture. And sometimes that\u2019s strengthening the business so they can deliver greater value to customers. It\u2019s always focused on how can we deliver greater value creation through the business, including returns to our shareholders. And so when you look at food safety, while it was an organic priority for us because it had strong growth opportunities and can leverage some of the capabilities of 3M, we also saw a path to greater value, a combination with Neogen, where you can strengthen the two businesses by putting them together and really create greater value for customers and for shareholders. So, it\u2019s very consistent with what \u2013 how we look at our portfolio management, and I think it\u2019s an outcome of a continuous process. And we are going to continue to actively manage our portfolio. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Thanks and good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to the margin bridge. You guys called out the manufacturing inefficiencies that occurred in Q4 related to the shorter production runs, more production changeovers, etcetera. Are you able to isolate in size, in dollars or margins? How large of a headwind that was in Q4 on a full year basis in \u201821? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Brett, it\u2019s really hard to do it that way because it has a compounding effect. So, unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to isolate the number. In total, when we put the manufacturing productivity together, including the spend, you can see it\u2019s $0.33 negative in total, which included three things. One is lower volume, which has an impact first on just generally the plans. Second is the material productivity. The third is the wage inflation and the prior headwinds that we had talked about when it comes to variable compensation, and then we continued to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Brett Linzey : Yes. It makes sense and understandably inflation, logistics pressures continue, but I am just trying to get a sense, do those resolve early in Q1 as some of the demand pulse gets better here? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, I think we are watching it, Brett. I think our view is we are going to see a volatile environment in the first half. Things should get better in the second half. But I would not expect a big snap back on stability of supply in 1Q of 2022. Brett Linzey : Right. Okay. And just wanted to come back to the comment on prioritizing investments for this year, I think last year, R&D as a percent of sales was at the lower end of where it\u2019s been historically. Does the R&D number need to move higher in \u201822, or can you keep it at the same level and just allocate those dollars more effectively? Mike Roman : Brett, it\u2019s really something we focus on, prioritizing our investments. We talk about prioritizing in growth, productivity and sustainability as we have come through the pandemic, as we came through 2021 accelerating those investments where we saw the best opportunity. That\u2019s R&D, that\u2019s CapEx, that\u2019s commercial investments. Very big focus on R&D, as you would expect. It\u2019s where we drive our innovation with that investment in R&D. And so the overall percent of sales that you see at an enterprise level, it wouldn\u2019t surprise you that there are parts of our portfolio that are much higher than that and others that are lower than average. And we are prioritizing that in some of the areas that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We see attractive investments. So, we actually are increasing R&D in some areas and managing it overall pretty well in line with where we have come from. But there is a lot going on underneath that. It\u2019s really that prioritization where we are targeting stepping up our investments in those most attractive areas. And it\u2019s true for CapEx as well. Brett Linzey : Got it. Makes sense. Best of luck. Mike Roman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike Roman : Hi Deane. Deane Dray : Just a couple clarifications. Going back to the opening Q&A and Nigel\u2019s question on December coming in better, you did clarify that masks were better by $40 million. What were the other businesses that did better or product lines that did better in December? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, $40 million was for the whole quarter, Deane, just to clarify that. December definitely had a pickup there. Consumer came in strong and then healthcare came in strong. So, that\u2019s the other two I would call out in December. Deane Dray : Got it. And then when Bruce made two topics that are going to change in reporting going forward, could you just clarify the second one? It sounded like you were not going to report segment, volume and price separately? Just clarify what the thinking is there and what will we see going forward? Bruce Jermeland : Yes, Deane, this is Bruce. We have never reported separate segment volume and price by the segments. We have at the total enterprise level and the geography level. We are no longer going to report separate volume and price going forward. And it\u2019s due to a lot of the benchmarking work we have done. Also, the one conversation piece we have had throughout the year relative to prices, what\u2019s showing up in price is what gets realized in the quarter. And it\u2019s not a true reflection of the actions we are taking in the end market. So, I think it created a lot of confusion relative to 3M taking price or not. Yes, we are taking price, but it really is only showing up relative to what actually got realized in a particular period. So, organic growth is our number one objective, and that\u2019s what we are going to report going forward. Deane Dray : So, Slide 12 in the appendix where you break out organic volume by region and price, does that go away? Bruce Jermeland : Yes. So, yes, if you recall, Deane, when we move to our new business group-led business model, we are running global businesses now. We no longer have a separate international structure. So \u2013 and that\u2019s how we are operating the business driving growth around the world no matter where it\u2019s at. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Hi Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you give us a little more color into what you are seeing in electronics? I think you mentioned in Q4 is down still and it tends to be quite volatile for you. So, without giving a specific outlook for \u201822, have you seen any improvement in semiconductor availability is starting to help that business? How are inventories in the channel? At what point do your businesses such as data center-focused products, auto electrification start to become meaningful enough to better support that business? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, I would say, Andy, and I will start with your first thing on chips. So, production did go up in auto in December versus what was originally planned. For the year, auto ended at plus 2 for the quarter, it ended at minus 13. And I think it came in a little better than what was the original forecast. So, it did get a little better there. I think what we are seeing is it\u2019s still volatile from a supply chain perspective. And our view is that you are going to see that volatility in the first half of 2022. When you take consumer electronics, consumer electronics was down on a year-over-year basis. It\u2019s projected to be up from \u201821 to \u201822 for the year, and we will have to see when launches happen, etcetera. And then on the fluids or that\u2019s \u2013 the semiconductor of our business, the business has grown very well. We continue to perform very well. We continue to deliver value for our customers. And in 2022, you should expect us to continue doing the same. Andy Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a little more color on what you are seeing regionally, obviously, you have tougher comparisons in China as you go into next \u2013 into \u201822, there is some geopolitical risk out there. So, any sort of trends that you are seeing or want to highlight as we are going into \u201822 regionally? Mike Roman : Yes. Andy, I would take you to GDP and IPI, I think you \u2013 there is an outlook for 2022 that says we are going to see a pretty good backdrop globally, led by probably U.S. and Asia in that regard and the stronger areas, IPI, GDP, both. If you look \u2013 if you go into China, in particular, we saw growth in 2021. We were up low-single digits in Q4, which was similar to the overall China macro. For the whole year, we were up low-double digits, which was above the macro for China. So, continue to see growth opportunities there. Our growth was led by our healthcare business. We saw growth in our consumer business. Both of those were up low teens. Our industrial business was up low-single digits in the quarter. And where we saw some weakness was in transportation and electronics, really back to the semiconductor chip challenges, some of the supply chain challenges. Those were impacting that in China as well. So, I paint that picture, so you can kind of see we have a focus on growing at or above the macro in China as well. And the outlook is to be positive. And we are prioritizing, like everywhere else, where we see the trends. And some of those areas in electronics have continued to stay strong, while overall consumer electronics challenged with the chip shortage. We saw strength in semiconductor fabrication, factory automation. So, they are \u2013 we see those as areas that we are well positioned as we come into 2022 as well. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Steve. Stephen Tusa : Just a question on \u2013 I know, Monish, you have kind of taken on this, I guess an additional title of kind of Transformation Officer. Many times, that means there is going to be some kind of major portfolio moves. What is this kind of transformation title mean from that perspective? Is it really looking at kind of the structure of the company, or is it more about improving processes and more of an operating? Mike Roman : Yes, Steve, I am interested in Monish\u2019s answer as well, but I thought I would just frame it up. He is leading transformation, which is really taking responsibility for leading our IT and digital strategy, and overall transformation includes what we call business transformation. Monish has been driving some of these efforts from his role as CFO, and he led transformation his prior employer as well. He brings that operating rigor to it. So, when we recently hired a new Chief Information and Digital Officer that reports to Monish as part of that. So, if you think about it, it\u2019s really that business transformation we have talked about for a number of years, focused on deploying new digital capabilities, digital strategy broadly, digital enterprise capabilities like our ERP and our move to the cloud, also digital operations and even how we are digitizing for our customers. And so it\u2019s really bringing his leadership to that. So, Monish can give you his perspective on it. Monish Patolawala : Listen, I don\u2019t have much to add, Steve, other than the fact that when we look at the opportunity at 3M, whether it\u2019s growth at or by macro, margin expansion and strong cash. Underneath that, you can tuck in portfolio. Digital is a big opportunity for us, whether it\u2019s leveraging data and data analytics. And I just view my job as to enable the teams to achieve what 3M can. So, I am excited and we have a great set of people working on this. Stephen Tusa : Right. And then I think you guys mentioned buyback in the presentation. I might have missed this, but is that a new kind of \u2013 are you guys going to be stepping up buybacks in a significant way here in the near-term? Is it a change in tone on buybacks or pretty consistent with what you have said historically? Monish Patolawala : No, Steve, it\u2019s pretty consistent. As the level of buyback is always our fourth priority in the four priorities to the extent the amount of buyback will always get determined by the amount of cash we have, what the market is doing, what the opportunities are. And as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw an opportunity where we thought the stock was attractive. And we felt we should step up buyback in the fourth quarter, but no change in tone, that still remains the fourth priority in our list of capital allocation priorities. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Thanks for being straightforward. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Mike Roman : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. So, my first question is on Asia and specifically as we see Omicron in China, what\u2019s the feedback you are getting on the ground about the scope of shutdowns versus what was expecting around the Olympics? And how is that going to play out in the first quarter given what you are seeing right now? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yes. Andrew, I would say what we came through December into the New Year, there is a lot of uncertainty around Omicron and how it\u2019s going to impact supply chains globally. And in China, obviously, an important focus there and with the Olympics coming a spotlight on that as well. We have been managing supply chain, logistics issues there as well. You saw that a little bit play out in the China export numbers in Q4, down like low-single digits, I think for the quarter. So, it\u2019s something we are focused on. We have been managing through the challenges we have seen and we will update you as we get further into February and March. Andrew Obin : And just the second question is almost 2 years into COVID and maybe it\u2019s a little preview for your Analyst Day. But almost 2 years into COVID, what portions of your portfolio sort of look structurally better and what has lagged? And what do you think happens as the world normalizes again? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew, maybe I will start with we have been investing \u2013 accelerated investments in a number of areas as we come through COVID and it\u2019s really recognizing some of the trends, maybe even that we came into the pandemic with that accelerated. So, we talk about investments in automotive electrification, maybe less COVID-related, but certainly a trend that\u2019s accelerating. We saw home improvement accelerate during COVID. So, we are investing in those areas. We are seeing strong growth as we came through 2021 in those areas, and we see that continuing as we go forward. So, that\u2019s the way we look at it. There is \u2013 across our portfolio, we have talked often about different parts of our portfolio, how are they doing relative year-over-year even back to 2019. I would say we had strength in broad parts of the portfolio, including those that we are investing in. There is a couple of areas that are still recovering. And Monish even highlighted one in his comments about how elective procedures are still at about 90% of medical procedures that is at about 90% of where they were in 2019. So, there is the impact of COVID on increased hospitalization rates and the knock-on effect on healthcare, there is still \u2013 we think there is still some impact net-net versus 2019 in some of those areas. So, it plays out a little differently across our portfolio, even where we saw strong demand in our home care, in our cleaning products in 2020, of tough comp and a little lower growth as we came through 2021. So, there is a number of trends that we are watching, again, prioritizing where we see an opportunity to invest and leverage 3M\u2019s strengths and then \u2013 and managing those other areas to \u2013 in the middle of the supply chain disruptions to serve customers as things recover. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning and thanks for fitting me in here. Mike Roman : Good morning John. John Walsh : Maybe just one question from me and going back, I think to a comment you made in response to Nigel\u2019s question around restructuring. I thought I heard $70 million. Just wanted to make sure that was kind of capturing all the restructuring delta and asked if that was in line with the Q3 update, because I guess by my math, I had a little bit higher of a number, but I just wanted to ask for clarification there. Monish Patolawala : Yes, it\u2019s a good one, John. So, you heard it right, it\u2019s $70 million. And the reason is we achieved more in the fourth quarter than we had previously thought. And that\u2019s why you also saw margins came in higher and because we achieve more. So, just to recap the program, in total, we have spent the program that was announced in Q4 of 2020. We had said we would go in \u2013 we have spent $260 million to-date. We had told you in Q3 that it would be $300 million to $325 million. Right now, we are saying up to $300 million. We had said benefits would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We achieved approximately $180 million in that program. So, there is a carryover benefit of $70 million. John Walsh : Great. Appreciate the clarification. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : Thank you.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and John Banovetz, our Chief Technology Officer. John is joining us today to discuss our progress on the sustainability goals that we introduced in February last year. Mike, Monash and John will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to slide 3. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight a financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2022. We recognize that the increases in legal-related charges that we have incurred the past couple of years have impacted investors' understanding of our underlying financial and operating performance. We have been disclosing respirator and PFAS impacts in our public filings and have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include all impacts of accrual changes and legal fees for respirator masks, PFAS and combat arms matters. This change is a result of discussions we have had with many of you, along with recent benchmarking work we have done. This morning, we issued a Form 8-K with updated non-GAAP financial performance history for the past three years. Further, we will be issuing a Form 8-K amending our most recent annual report on Form 10-K to reflect the effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting immediately after filing our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q this afternoon. Also, our Q1 2022 financial performance and full year 2022 guidance in today's press release and presentation incorporate these changes. Please note, that our guidance does not include future changes to reserves for PFAS or combat arms. Highlighted on this slide is the impact of this change to our non-GAAP financial reporting. As you can see, operating margins in 2021 were 22.2% on this new adjusted basis, or up 70 basis points from pre-COVID levels in 2019, versus down 40 basis points on the previous basis. And adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded 110 basis points since 2019 to 27.6%. Looking specifically at our Q1 2022 performance on slide 4, adjusted earnings were $2.65 per share. This result excludes total special items of $0.39 per share, which is comprised of $0.13 of legal related costs in the quarter, along with a $0.26 charge for PFAS-related remediation in Belgium, which we previously announced via a press release and Form 8-K filing on March 30. As we indicated in the March press release and Form 8-K filing, this charge would be reflected as an adjustment in arriving at our first quarter results adjusted for special items. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And, of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to slide five, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In a challenging global environment, 3M delivered a strong start to 2022. As Bruce just noted, to provide additional clarity on litigation-related costs and our underlying business performance, starting in the first quarter, we are reporting adjusted earnings to exclude significant litigation costs, which was $0.13 in Q1. As we communicated on March 30, we also made an additional investment related to our operations in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, which resulted in a $0.26 charge. Excluding this investment, our financial outlook for 2022 remains unchanged. As you recall, at our strategic outlook meeting in February, we committed to driving growth and shareholder value in 2022 by continuing to innovate for our customers and reposition our portfolio to win in attractive markets. We also committed to deliver strong margins, EPS and cash flow through a focus on operational excellence, while continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. In the first quarter, we executed well and followed through on these commitments, which I will discuss on slide six. We're relentlessly focused on serving our customers, while managing supply chain disruptions, inflation and geopolitical pressures. We posted organic growth of 2%, along with sequential margin improvement, adjusted EPS of $2.65 and robust cash generation. Overall, demand is strong, though the global economic outlook has softened due to challenges in certain end markets, evolving impacts from COVID and recent geopolitical events. All of our businesses started the year with good performance. End market demand was strong in Safety and Industrial, partially offset by a decline in disposable respirators. In Transportation and Electronics, our automotive business continued to outperform build rates despite the impact of semiconductor shortages. Healthcare performed well with 5% growth and consumer grew 3% and in addition to 9% growth last year. To position us for long-term growth, we continue to prioritize investments in high-growth opportunities across our businesses, commercial opportunities that are sizable and significant. For example, our automotive electrification platform grew 20% organically on the strength of new innovations on top of 30% growth in 2021. In health care, our biopharma business posted 15% organic growth as 3M Science advances the development and manufacturing of new therapeutics and vaccines. To support growing demand for our biopharma solutions, we are investing $35 million to double capacity at our plant in Columbia, Missouri. We also continue to manage our portfolio and unlock value for our customers and shareholders. We are on track to close the divestiture of our food safety business in the third quarter. And in March, we divested our floor products business in Western Europe, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our consumer business. In addition, yesterday, we announced that we acquired the technology assets of LeanTec a provider of digital inventory management solutions for the automotive aftermarket segment in the United States and Canada. It is another example of how we win in the core and build for the future, creating new platforms to access emerging trends and opportunities. In this case, the connected bodyshop, one of 3M's digital platforms that brings together data, analytics and material science. We continue to navigate global supply chain disruptions, which have been amplified by recent geopolitical unrest. We are doing whatever is necessary to take care of customers, while managing extended lead-times and elevated inventory levels. At the same time, we have continued to drive strong pricing to offset inflation. Like many other global companies, we are actively managing through the conflict in Ukraine. Our focus remains on ensuring the safety of 3Mers in harm's way. I am proud how 3M has stepped up to help from donating nearly $4 million to employees welcoming refugees into their homes. We stand with our Ukrainian colleagues and have suspended operations in Russia. Given what we are seeing around the world, we expect supply chain challenges to persist for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in the business while returning $1.6 billion in the quarter to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 64th consecutive year of increases. With respect to litigation, we are vigorously defending ourselves in combat arms bellwether cases. We are pleased that a jury cited with 3M in the most recent bellwether trial earlier this month, which was a plaintiff's counsel pick. To-date, we have won six and lost eight trials and have appealed or will appeal all adverse verdicts. Eight bellwethers were also dismissed by plaintiffs before they went to trial. I would also like to provide an update on operational disruptions at our factory in Zwijndrecht, which I know is top of mind. Last month, I visited Belgium to meet with local leaders and affirm our commitment to the Zwijndrecht community. As previously stated, we continue to work with Flemish authorities to address our remediation obligations and work toward greater operational certainty. Last September, we announced an investment of \u20ac125 million to advance air and water stewardship in our existing operations, which has included the installation of a new state-of-the-art filtration system. In addition, last month, we committed \u20ac150 million to remediation that addresses legacy manufacturing and disposal of PFAS on 3M site and in the surrounding area. To help reduce the impact to customers, we are supplying from other global sites and actively working to address any future potential impacts. We will continue to collaborate with officials to bring idle processes back online in Zwijndrecht, deliver essential products to our customers and follow through on our commitments. On May 11, we will publish our Global Impact Report, highlighting our progress to our sustainability commitments. In a moment, 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz, will provide an update on an important part of these commitments, our environmental stewardship goals. In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year for 3M, and I thank all of our employees for their contributions. As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to addressing the broader challenges of supply chain disruption and litigation risk as we continue to invest in our underlying businesses, which remain strong and well positioned to grow. We are maintaining our full year expectations as adjusted for the reporting change that we have discussed, which will provide greater clarity regarding our underlying performance as we navigate litigation matters. At 3M, we are driven by purpose and powered by four industry-leading businesses, unique global capabilities and a highly experienced and diverse team. I am confident in our ability to grow above the macro and improve our operational performance as we move through 2022. I will now turn it over to John Banovetz. John? John Banovetz : Thank you, Mike. And please turn to slide 7. As a global manufacturer, 3M has a long record of environmental stewardship. Over the last two decades, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, while more than doubling our revenue. Nearly 50% of our global electricity use is renewable, on our way to 100%. And over the last five years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 100 million tons of emissions. To drive our growth as a company, we will continue to build on our strong foundation, advance our strategy and invest in science-based commitments to improve the environment. Last year, we accelerated our leadership with a commitment to invest $1 billion and deliver our new goals around air, water and waste. As you see on the left side of the slide, our goals are meaningful, authentic and impactful to the world. They are rooted in 3M science, applying math to a path to rapidly bend the curve on emissions. We committed to a 10% reduction in water use by 2022 and a 25% reduction by 2030. To improve water quality, we committed to install filtration technology by 2023 at our largest water using sites, and we committed to become carbon neutral with aggressive milestones along the way. Finally, we will reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 125 million pounds by 2025. Over the last year, we have made strong progress on each of our goals, putting us ahead of schedule in some areas and on track in all other areas. We have already cut our carbon footprint by 25% and reduced our use of water by more than 10%, which included a new closed-loop water recirculation system at our factory indicator, Alabama. As Mike mentioned, we've also advanced our filtration capabilities in Zwijndrecht with a new state-of-the-art system. Part of the \u20ac125 million investment we announced last September with additional work completed at several other 3M sites. Later this year, in Cordova, Illinois, for example, new filtration technologies will be fully installed, including ion exchange and reverse osmosis. We've announced $165 million investment in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which follows our decision last year to close our incinerator, resulting in improved waste management while reducing energy and water usage at the site. In addition, over the last year, we have reduced our use of plastic by 19 million pounds through innovative designs in our consumer business, such as our Scotch double-sided mounting tape, which we reformulated to eliminate PVC plastic and packaging and reduce our solvent use by 300,000 pounds per year. In summary, we are on track to meet or exceed each of the goals laid out last February, and we will advance our progress in 2022. This year, we expect to reduce our water usage by an additional 5%, double our reduction of virgin-based plastic and further expand our filtration capabilities across our largest water using sites. I'm proud of how 3Mers have come together to follow through on our commitments. Moving forward, we will continue to work with communities, customers and governments to advance our environmental stewardship and make a difference in the world. As Mike mentioned, I encourage you to read our annual global impact report to be released on May 11 with more details on our priorities and progress. Now, I will turn it to Monish, who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, John. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide nine. The 3M team delivered strong execution in Q1 in a macro environment that remains extremely fluid and increasingly uncertain. We remained focused on delivering for our customers, drove operational execution and maintained cost discipline, while also continuing to invest in the business to fuel growth. First quarter total sales were $8.8 billion, which increased 1.7% on an organic basis. As a reminder, organic sales growth does not include impacts from FX or M&A. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21.4% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q1 last year. We continue to drive price actions, realize savings from past restructuring and maintain strong spending discipline, which helped offset both known and new headwinds. As I highlighted in my February Investor Day presentation, we made significant progress driving actions in 2021 to address rising raw material and logistics costs. We are leveraging the power of daily management, data and data analytics, along with the spirit of embracing the red to direct actions to offset the inflationary pressures. During last year, we developed new sourcing and pricing tools and processes to improve agility, drive alignment and simplify our processes. In addition, we are also enhancing our reporting and data analytics capabilities by rolling out tools that model price realization, leakage and elasticity. These efforts continue to pay off in Q1 as benefits from selling price actions offset raw material and logistics headwinds. Looking ahead, while we see raw material and logistics inflation persisting, we will continue to leverage daily management powered by data and data analytics with the expectation of offsetting raw material and logistics inflation through pricing actions in 2022. Also, during the first quarter, we completed the final actions related to our December 2020 restructuring announcement. Since Q4 2020, we have incurred total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $280 million versus an original expectation of $250 million to $300 million. These actions are expected to deliver total pretax savings of approximately $250 million are at the top end of our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million. We realized $180 million of the savings in 2021 and expect the balance of the savings of $70 million in 2022, which is incorporated in our guidance. In the quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator demand of nearly $50 million, which negatively impacted operating margins by 10 basis points and earnings by $0.03 a share. On any given day, our global sourcing, manufacturing, and supply chain teams continue to navigate a number of items, including raw material and logistics availability, evolving COVID-related impacts, including mandated lockdowns, employee absenteeism in our US factories in January and February, and now in China, the continued shutdown of certain operations in our plant in Belgium, and recently, the impacts on the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. These dynamics continue to result in ongoing changes to demand plans, along with increasing costs and pressuring manufacturing productivity as we work to serve our customers. Also, as you will hear from me throughout the year, we continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets, including automotive, home improvement, safety, health care, electronics, and software. Moving to raw materials, we continue to experience inflationary pressures with a year-on-year increase of approximately $215 million in the quarter, which resulted in a headwind of 2.4 percentage points to margins and $0.30 per share to earnings. Foreign exchange fluctuation is something we are watching closely, particularly given the geopolitical uncertainties. During the quarter, FX was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, was a negative $0.04 per share impact to earnings year-on-year, primarily the result of the strength of the US dollar. Other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.04 per share year-on-year with benefits from a lower share count and a decline in net interest expense, more than offsetting a headwind from a higher tax rate. While year-on-year margins and earnings declined, it is also important to look sequentially given the fluid and uncertain environment. Our actions to continue to drive price to offset inflation, navigate supply chain challenges and control costs enabled us to expand adjusted margins and earnings 140 basis points and $0.20 per share, respectively. Please turn to slide 10. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $715 million, with conversion of 47%, which was in line with our expectations. Year-on-year conversion was lower due to higher cash compensation and an increase in CapEx for growth and sustainability investments. Looking at the full year, our free cash flow conversion expectations of 90% to 100% remain unchanged. As you know, we currently have a very fluid environment, especially around global supply chain and logistic challenges. Therefore, we will experience some working capital ups and downs in the short run, but you should see the benefits of the power of data and analytics and operational rigor start to play out once things stabilize. Capital expenditures were $424 million in the quarter, up 37% year-on-year as we increase investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $852 million and share repurchases of $773 million. Our cash flow the global economic situation and our stock price are all factors into determining the pace and amount of share repurchases. We believe our current stock price presents a good buying opportunity and we have been active in the market to start the year. While we are currently out of the market due to the pending food safety divestiture, we currently anticipate $2 billion in aggregate share repurchases over the course of the full year. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 2% as we continue to invest in the business. Our capital structure is well positioned, giving us financial flexibility and optionality. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. Please turn to slide 12 for our business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 0.5% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result included a disposable respirator sales decline of approximately $50 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's Q1 organic growth by 1.5 percentage points. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's 20% pandemic-driven comparison. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, if trends change, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as COVID impacts evolve. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Industrial adhesives and tapes electrical markets, abrasives and closure and masking were all up mid-single digits compared to last year, while roofing granules and automotive aftermarket businesses were up low single digits. Safety and Industrial's first quarter adjusted operating income was $699 million, down 14% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.9%, down 3.5 percentage points. Year-on-year, adjusted operating margin performance was impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs and manufacturing productivity headwind. Partially offsetting these impacts were selling price increases, spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. The Safety and Industrial business group continues to focus on building the future through emerging trends and opportunities. Most recently, 3M acquired the technology assets of LeanTec to advance digital solutions for auto body shops. This digital platform integrates data capture and analysis with material product platforms, providing shop owners and managers more access to data for enhanced productivity and inventory management. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on slide 13, which declined 0.3% on an organic basis, primarily due to the ongoing impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. Organic sales in our auto OEM business were flat year-on-year, versus a 5% decline in global car and light truck builds, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial Solutions grew high single digits. Advanced Materials was flat, while transportation safety was down mid-single digits year-on-year. First quarter operating income was $496 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.2%, down 2 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts and investments in auto electrification. These year-on-year headwinds were partially offset by increases in selling price, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. The Transportation and Electronics business group is focused on executing well against its strategic imperatives to build new growth platforms in high-growth segments, including automotive electrification, semiconductor, electronic materials and graphic and architectural films. Turning to our health care business on slide 14, which posted a first quarter organic sales increase of 4.7%, with growth across every business. Our Medical Solutions business increased mid-single digits organically. First quarter US elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels, as COVID slowed the pace of procedures, particularly in January and February. Sales in our Oral Care business grew low single digits year-on-year. Global oral care procedure volumes dipped in January and February due to COVID, but started to recover in March. Overall, patient visits for the quarter were 85% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels. We continue to watch COVID-related trends and its impacts on the global healthcare industry, including labor shortages, which drove lower-than-expected surgical and dental procedure volumes in the quarter. The separation and purification business increased mid-single-digits year-on-year with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew mid-single-digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management and clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased high single-digits. As Mike mentioned, we remain on track for a Q3 close of the planned divestiture of this business, which will be combined with Neogen. Healthcare's first quarter operating income was $448 million down 3.5% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.1%, down 1.4 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity, investments in the business, and food safety deal-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline, and benefits from restructuring actions. Despite the current environment, the Healthcare business group is focused on delivering clinically differentiated innovative platforms that improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care. We have been sharply focused on three key segments; wound care; health care IT; and biopharma filtration. These segments are well supported by key market trends, which include; increasing chronic conditions driven by an aging population; shifting of care to lowest cost setting; improving health care access trends; and finally, digital and connected solutions. Please turn to slide 15. Lastly, our Consumer business delivered first quarter organic growth of 3.4% versus last year, with growth across every business. Our Home Improvement business continued to perform well, up low single-digits on top of last year's growth of over 20%. This business continued to deliver strong growth with our home improvement retail customers in our category-leading Filtrete and Command brands. Stationery and Office and Home Care grew low single-digits organically in Q1. And finally, our Consumer Health and Safety business was up low teens year-on-year. Consumer's operating income was $224 million, down 17% compared to last year. Operating margin was 17.1%, down 3.7 percentage points year-on-year. Historically, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter of the year for our consumer business. But this year's operating margin was further impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints, along with higher raw materials and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by good price performance, strong spending discipline, and benefits from restructuring actions. Continuing to innovate and drive sustainability within the Consumer Business Group is a top priority. As consumers and businesses are increasingly shopping online, they want solutions that protect their packages and content, while making the process more convenient and sustainable than ever. As a result, we recently launched Scotch Cushion Lock, a new sustainable alternative to plastic cushion wrap and a perfect solution for protecting and packaging items with 100% recycled paper. Our Scotch portfolio is centered on innovating and serving this large and growing market. Please turn to slide 17 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. As you know, most companies are facing a macro environment that has become even more fluid and uncertain due to several factors, including continued global supply chain and logistics challenges, ongoing impact from semiconductor constraints, particularly on the automotive and electronics industries, evolving impacts of COVID-19, growing geopolitical uncertainties, increasing foreign exchange volatility and finally, rising inflationary pressures, including raw materials, logistics, labor and energy costs. This has resulted in softening trends impacting full year growth expectations for GDP and IPI. Both macro indices are now expected to be up approximately 3% versus up 4% at the start of the year. Despite the fluid and uncertain macro environment, we continue to expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $10.75 to $11.25. This range incorporates the change to our adjusted earnings that Bruce highlighted at the start of the call. And finally, free cash flow conversion expectations remain in the range of 90% to 100%. Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the second quarter. First, we are seeing a slow start to sales in April, primarily due to COVID-related impacts in China, along with the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. Raw materials and logistics costs are expected to be up, impacting Q2 year-on-year by approximately $225 million. We expect disposable respirator demand to decline both year-on-year and sequentially by approximately $100 million to $200 million. During the first quarter and particularly over the last month, growth expectations for transportation and electronic end markets have moderated. Second quarter global auto builds are currently forecasted to increase approximately 2% year-on-year, however, declined 3% sequentially. And smartphones are forecasted to be up approximately 1% year-on-year, but declined 5% sequentially. We expect both US medical and oral care elective procedure volumes in Q2 in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And finally, as a reminder, last year's second quarter included an approximately $90 million operating income benefit or $0.12 per share from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling. To wrap-up, although we remain cautious in this current environment, we are bullish about the long term. We are committed to delivering for our customers, taking appropriate price actions driving operational execution and managing spending, while continuing strong financial rigor and maintaining a strong capital structure and financial flexibility. In the long run, we will grow about the macro, expand margins and deliver strong cash. I want to take a minute to thank the 3M employees for delivering for our customers and shareholders in a very uncertain and fluid environment. Our team delivered 1.7% organic sales growth in the quarter, 21.4% adjusted margin, up 140 basis points sequentially and generated $715 million in adjusted free cash flow. I also want to take a moment to personally thank our customers and suppliers for putting their trust and confidence in us and for maintaining strong and close partnership that help us navigate the current challenges. We had a good start to the year. We are watching the environment closely and working on navigating current challenges, with more work to do. That concludes my remarks for the first quarter. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Steve. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just maybe give a little more precision on the second quarter? And then, I mean, there's a lot of kind of moderate downward revisions to some of the assumptions. I'm just not 100% clear to me how the guide is reaffirmed, maybe you're talking about more -- you're still within the range but towards the low end? Just kind of those two factors, just to start. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Steve. I'll just start with the overall guide for the year. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. So the guide for the year, coming into the year was 2% to 5% organic growth. We are continuing to see that, that that's doable in the 2% to the 5% growth, no change there at all. The purpose of giving you the second quarter outlook was just, as you're building your models to help you think through the macroeconomic environment. As I've said, the start to April was slower, mainly driven by China and the work there. But we'll have to see when the lockdowns are released and how fast China ramps up historically when they have the ramp-up is there. So we're just giving you what we've seen in April. And then, you can see some of the macro trends in the auto and consumer industry have gone down sequentially, driven by semiconductor and chip shortages, but health care starts moving up from the 85% to the 90% to the 90% to the 95%. So puts and takes for the year, we still see ourselves getting to the 2% to the 5% range that we told you about with adjusted earnings per share of $10.75 to $11.25. So no change there. Overall, I would say -- and market demand has remained strong in the first quarter. So far, we are seeing it strong, other than for what I told you about China, but we are overall still seeing markets strong. And I think time will play itself out on how some of these uncertainties go through the year, but bullish about the long term and bullish about the year. Steve Tusa : Got it. Great. Thanks a lot. Mike Roman : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I think a lot of the issues you addressed this morning are pretty comparable to what we've seen everywhere else. But can we talk a little bit about pricing? I know you stopped breaking that out as a line item, but perhaps, you can talk more big picture. I mean, last quarter, you were up 2.6% price and your core volumes this quarter, around 2%, so that would imply you probably -- if I had to guess, you probably a little bit better than that in price and maybe volumes are more flattish on apples-to-apples. But can you talk about kind of the price cost parity goals? I mean when do you think -- given the higher costs that have come in even just in the last month, when do you think you can reach your price cost parity -- can you reach it this year and perhaps when? And directionally, our price is still going up. And I'll pass it on after that. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Sure, Scott. Listen, the team did an amazing job. As I've talked about the tools that we've had, the daily management. Last year, we started slow on pricing, 0.14%, went up to 1.4% in Q3 and 2.6% and in Q4. This quarter, we continued the momentum, which was driven by two pieces, the carryover impact, plus new pricing. As I said in my prepared remarks, we more than offset the amount of inflation. So, if you just do the math on a rate basis, not just on a dollar basis. So, that's -- we got a 3% plus price in the quarter. The team is very focused on looking at the extra inflation that's coming in, they're already working on higher price. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the goal is to offset the extra inflation that we are seeing with extra price and so a really good start to the first quarter. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Bruce Jermeland : Nigel, are you there? Operator : Mr. Coe, your line is open. You may proceed with your question. Bruce Jermeland : Operator, why don't we move to the next question please? Operator : We will move on to the next one from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Bruce Jermeland : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a first question around the -- I understood on the Belgian plant, the remediation measures. But it is a topic that you sort of mentioned a bunch of times in recent months, and we get that question a lot on the plant from investors. Just trying to scale sort of the import of the plant to 3M's kind of aggregate operations. Maybe help us understand kind of what impact from the plant production issues is dialed into your guidance now, now that you're sort of giving us a full update with one quarter behind you. Where are we in terms of kind of inventories at that plant that you can keep shipping from it even without full production? Mike Roman : Yes, Julian. So, as we've talked in the past, we've had some certain operations shut down at that plant, and we continue to work on -- with local authorities on the updated permits that we have there and continue to work to resolve that. We're a leading provider out of that plant for specialty fluids, including heat transfer fluids that are used in semiconductor, and we're working to address the operational disruptions we have. Zwijndrecht is an important source of supply for those materials to our customers. And so we're working to resolve it there, so we can continue to supply from there. We're also looking to supply from capacity that we have at alternative sites where possible. So it's it was an impact that we saw in Q1. It's something that's built into our outlook. It is something we're working with customers on to address any ongoing disruption for them. So it's something we'll keep updating you on as we mitigate the impacts and we can update you as appropriate going forward. Julian Mitchell : Understood. But it's not a sort of material headwind dialed in for Q2 or the balance of the year. You can sort of cope with it, the shortage still. Mike Roman : Yeah. There is a process we're working through. And so there's some uncertainty there. We've got to resolve the permit issues there. We've got a permit renewal as we go through the year. So this is all something that we're working on. We've been careful to say that we have certain operations that have been interrupted at this time. There's a potential for operations to resume. There's a potential for operation \u2013 additional operations to shut down. So we've been careful to lay out the possibilities. What we saw in \u2013 in Q1 was part of our results and is an interruption that we're working on with customers. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my follow-up around the EMEA region, you saw organic sales down about 2% there in the first quarter, understood that probably April is maybe trending worse than that based on Monish's comments. Maybe help us understand kind of are you seeing in EMEA exactly? Most companies seem to say it's about the same as it was a few months ago. Your sort of numbers and comments imply that you are seeing some kind of shorter cycle weakness there. So maybe help us understand kind of what's changing in Europe by region or industry in terms of demand for you? Mike Roman : Yeah. And Julian, as you recall, we realigned around our businesses back in March of 2019. So we really are managing each of our four go-to-market models globally and executing in the areas. We update you on just how we're performing overall in the areas of the world. And so EMEA down 2% in Q1 really was led by declines in our Consumer and Safety and Industrial businesses. Transportation and Electronics was down slightly. Health care was up actually low single digits in the quarter. So we saw some impact from both, I would say, COVID as well as the supply chain disruptions and the \u2013 I would say, the challenges in Ukraine. So it's a \u2013 it is an ongoing dynamic that we're watching closely. We saw strong growth in a number of our businesses as we came through the quarter and Monish walked through the outlook on the macro. So certainly, that will have an impact on EMEA. But I would say we're watching it closely as we look at the rest of the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hi, Jeff. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Just thinking about the adjusted framework, and I didn't get a chance to go back and look at all the restatements. But just to be clear, -- so on a move-forward basis, we're just excluding litigation and environmental-related costs, both on the go forward and on the way you restated the numbers? Monish Patolawala : I'm not sure I follow, Jeff, but you're asking, are we going to a go-forward basis? Yes. So we have made the adjustment that going forward, all costs for significant litigation matters will be shown as an adjustment to our earnings. And so you will see the GAAP EPS number, which is reported and adjusted earnings per share. And we have also filed an 8-K showing you restating the history. And just so that you can catch up on what it was, and Bruce talked about in his prepared remarks is, for example, in 2021, we would have excluded approximately $0.61, which was cost for significant litigation matters as a -- to show it as an adjustment, which will be 140 basis points of margin impact. Bruce Jermeland : Yes, Jeff, the other comment I would have is, it does not include potential changes in future reserves, just so that's clear. Jeff Sprague : Yes. I mean the thing that's tricky about this guide, it's not to editorialize, right, but I think you're leaving things like Brazil charges and gains that are truly one-off in the numbers. And stuff like litigation that might be lumpy, but is sort of ongoing and pulling that out of the numbers. I mean, I guess, we all have the discretion to use GAAP if we want. But it's just a confusing construct, I think, to use. Monish Patolawala : Fair point, Jeff. Fair point. At the end, listen, the first results are GAAP EPS. There's no going away from that. The reason we have broken this out into TWO was, there was a lot of requests from investors asking us to show -- to bring better clarity to the underlying performance of our business. And we have disclosed $90 million. We disclosed that last year, too. We are disclosing it this year, too, as a reminder of what we disclosed last year. And there was an ask for people to know how much we were spending on cost for our litigation-related matters. So we've shown that as a separate line item. You can put it either way. At the end of the day, GAAP EPS is the first thing. Second is the adjustment. So you can see how much you're spending on litigation and you can see the -- bring clarity to our underlying business. So, hopefully, that clarifies. Jeff Sprague : YES. Thank you. And then just on the kind of the litigation milestones. Can you update us on what is next on the docket, I believe, there's a few more things on combat arms. Maybe there's some other things we should be aware of, as we're looking over the balance of the year. Mike Roman : Yes. So Jeff, we still have two combat arms, bellwether cases to go here in May. So those are the next the next two trials on the docket. Beyond that, it's a little less clear what the next cases will be. If you look at PFAS, the other one trial schedules, I would say, have been moving frequently. We we're currently scheduled for two trials this year. We have a June trial in Michigan, and then we have an October trial in Alabama. The Aqueous Film Forming Foam multi-district litigation, the first trial there is not expected until 2023. So that gives you kind of an update. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. You may proceed with your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hi, Andy. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Monish, to the extent you can, could you give us a little more color on how you're thinking about Safety and Industrial margin moving forward? I know margin was down year-over-year, but it was materially up sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. Is that a function of maybe better mix with mask being a bit stronger? I think you mentioned strong spending discipline restructuring to the extra $70 million restructuring benefits find their way into the segment in the quarter in a bigger way? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, I would tell you, I'll start, Andy, with -- if you go back to Mike Vale\u2019s comments at Investor Day, he talked about one of his priorities is continuing to drive margin expansion. And we saw that sequentially. We knew going into the year that the year-on-year comp will be difficult, as you correctly pointed out with the amount of inflation. But the team has driven momentum on all items, which is price, continue to see the restructuring benefits, we're able to continue to drive productivity in the factories, at the same time, continue to invest in the right amount of growth as based on the priority platforms that we have listed out, and you saw it in the first quarter. Our mask respirator did come in better. When we had come in in the beginning of the quarter, we had told you it would be down sequentially. $100 million to $150 million. It came in at $50 million down, so we know we came in stronger. I think we'll have to watch what the year plays out when it comes to mask respirator and see where that lands is. We've also told you -- it does have an impact on us on an incremental margin basis. And coming into the year, we had said it to be down 700 on a year-over-year basis. But to sum it up, Mike, Wale, and his team are focused on continuing to drive margin expansion as all the initiatives that they've taken from productivity, price, restructuring continue to play out; offset that and as stability comes in, you'll start seeing the productivity also starting to kick in from a margin perspective. So, a good start to the year. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on Jeff's question just to make sure I understand the ongoing litigation costs. It looks like ex the special charge to the Belgium facility that you're guiding to about $0.35 of special items for 2022, but your litigation expenses have been running at like $0.13, $0.14 a quarter. So, are you expecting litigation cost to ramp down as the year goes on? Are there gains you're expecting? Any more color there, am I understanding it right? Bruce Jermeland : Yes, Andy, this is Bruce. If you look at our press release attachments, we lay out about $600 million in pretax charges estimated for the year. That includes the Zwijndrecht charge that we took in Q1. So, setting that aside, underlying ongoing litigation cost to be about $450 million. From a total EPS impact for the year, we forecast $0.86, which includes $0.26 related to Zwijndrecht charge in Q1. So, yes, the remaining $0.60, we took roughly $0.13 here in Q1. Andy Kaplowitz : Thank you. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Roman : Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Bruce, I just wanted to follow up on the $600 million. I'm just curious, like, what does that actually encompass in terms of litigation? And then also, is that all cash? Bruce Jermeland : Yes. So, when we provided our guidance back in February, encompassed in the $10.15 to $10.65 was a plan of about $0.60 on of costs related to ongoing litigation matters around PFAS, combat arms, and respirator. So -- and then we had an additional $0.26 charge as we announced on March 30th. So that what brings it to a total of $0.86. Relative to cash, Joe, that's difficult to know exactly when that plays out. For example, the $0.26 charge we took here in Q1 will be paid out over time as remediation actions take place. But also, it's important to remember that there is no presumed forecast relative to updates to reserves. So largely, we'll be cash driven, but won't line up 100%. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And then really, just wanted to follow up on China, I saw that it was down low-single digits in the quarter. I'd be curious, Mike or Monish, maybe just provide how that was trending as the quarter ended and into April. And then also, if you could provide a little bit of end market color, I would imagine that respirator sales are probably holding up a little bit better. But any type of commentary you can provide on trends there by end market would be helpful. Mike Roman : Yeah. Sure, Joe. I'll start with what you said it were down low-single digits in the first quarter that was reminder a top of 30% or more than 30% growth in Q1 of last year. We\u2019ve been impacted in Q1 by the COVID lockdowns. It's impacting manufacturing and distribution. And we saw that as we finished the quarter \u2013 it's also contributing to, I would say, a soft start to April as well. And it's really driving increasing backlog, factory shutdowns for us, also complying with government safety mandates, you're seeing increased port congestion, reduced air cargo capacity. So a number of things impacting that softer start. I would say it's \u2013 the outlook remains uncertain. It's difficult to predict. We see maybe a one percentage point kind of headwind as we start Q2, but that can change as we go through the year. So it's \u2013 it's important market we're seeing in Q1, we saw health care leading the way up mid-teens. We saw declines across consumer, safety, industrial and transportation and electronics, all down mid-single digits. So that's what got you to the low single digits. Joe Ritchie : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Roman : Hi, Andrew. Monish Patolawala : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on the consumer business. Historically, looking at your consumer peers gives you a fairly good indication where you guys can come out, but sort of looking at where Avery is, Kimberly, I think Procter & Gamble have reported. Your numbers seem to be this quarter, quite a bit below the peer group. And also, in particular, if you look at some of the verticals that you disclosed like roofing granules, home improvement, separation purification, I would have expected those to do better given the end market? I guess the question I'm asking, we know the issue in the Belgium facility, but should we be thinking about a specific vertical within your technology portfolio that's being particularly impacted by supply chain that sort of gauge your ability to grow in this environment? Mike Roman : Yeah, Andrew, I would say you highlighted a couple of those particular challenges. The supply chain more broadly is impacting all of our businesses. So we're seeing disruptions in raw materials, logistics, inflation all that's impacting broadly our portfolio. Consumer did have organic growth up 3% in Q1 on top of 9% last year. And it was across all divisions. It was led by consumer health and safety also our home care and our home improvement products continue to lead the way. So we're seeing growth. And stacked on top of last year's growth, we're seeing good continued performance, good performance. They're not seeing any specific or particular impact. And if you look across the portfolio, aside from some of the disruptions from Zwijndrecht, we're not seeing supply chain focused in one part of our portfolio and other. It is, I would say, more -- some of the impacts maybe from COVID having a geographic impact. Health care elective procedures still looking for there. And as Monish highlighted, the outlook for the macro in certain end markets is softening. That's less about supply chain disruptions. Maybe automotive and electronics being impacted by semiconductor shortages but its really more end market slowdowns that are impacting our businesses, where you see an impact on something like electronics or automotive. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question. Interesting to note that you guys continue to push into electronics. You highlighted it as one of your sort of technologies within your periodic table. Can you just talk more about sort of potential M&A opportunities when it comes to digital and how do sort of see it fitting into your broader portfolio? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew, our M&A strategy, an important part of capital allocation. We see it as a place we can create value. And the way we create value there is, as you're pointing at, we look at prioritizing attractive markets, higher growth markets that can leverage 3M capabilities, our technology, our manufacturing, our global reach to customers. And so, that really kind of steers us in our strategy for M&A. And when we can identify companies that we can integrate into 3M and really leverage those strengths of 3M, that's -- and move into more attractive, higher-growth market spaces, that's what's going to drive us, whether it's in opportunities around electronics or any one of our four businesses. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Luecke with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question. Brendan Luecke : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike Roman : Hey, Brendan. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Brendan. Brandon Luecke : So, just, I wanted to circle back on a couple of items from the guidance call earlier this year. Wondering how point of view may have changed given ongoing pressures on the business. So first off, I believe you talked about from 30% incremental net of respirator impact? Is that still a target in light of continued inflationary headwinds? And then, second part would be around operating cash flows. You guys have guided to, I think, $7 billion to $8 billion, but we came in around $1 billion in Q1. Wondering sort of what the puts and takes look like to get to the FY target there. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I'll start with your operating leverage question, Brendan. What I've said is, always in the long term, 30% to 40% is what our targeted leverage is, incremental leverage. And when you just think about it and look at our gross margin, which is anywhere between 45% to 50%, you can see you can get to the 30% to 40%. On top of that, what I would tell you, volume gives us the best leverage, so the more we can grow, you're going to get more incremental leverage. Add to that productivity in the factory, strategic sourcing will add more to that leverage and then continued actions to drive simplification, et cetera, all of them drive positive leverage. Then to that, we take some of that and we invest it back into growth, productivity and sustainability and then, of course, manage the litigation matters, et cetera, is ongoing. So when you put all that together, long term 30% to 40% is what is doable. When we came into the guide for the year, we had said its 30% to 40% is our target. We said around 30%. If you look at the midpoint of the range right now, which we have given you, which is 2% to 5% revenue growth, $10.75 to $11.25 on an EPS basis, and you put in FX, which could range anywhere from 1% to 2%, we ended at 2% right now for the first quarter and you assume that carries over, you will see that we are still targeting at the 30%. We are seeing higher inflation as everyone is seeing, but as I've said in my prepared remarks, we are going to offset that inflation, our target to offset that by price actions. We've started strong in the first quarter. You can see incremental leverage was up -- if the math is nearly 70% leverage in the first quarter sequentially and will continue to drive leverage. We, of course, have to factor in all the uncertainty that's going on in the world. But teams committed to driving it and I would say in the long run, also I don't see why we can't get to the 30% to 40%. Hopefully, I answered your question, Brendan, on item one. On your second item on operating cash flow, again, we have reiterated that we are -- and we started the year with 90% to 100% free cash flow conversion. We told you that at Investor Day, we reiterate. We have a path to get to the 90% to 100% free cash flow conversion. The first quarter at a 47% conversion was pretty much what we expected. It was all in the guide in the 90% to the 100%. The first quarter conversion is driven by two pieces. One is higher compensation expenses from a year-over-year basis as we paid out. And secondly is higher investments in sustainability that we had also called out. But if you look at history of 3M, the first quarter is always the lowest from a conversion rates than you build. So, we still see a path to the 90% to the 100%. Brendan Luecke : Outstanding. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Deane. Deane Dray : A question for Monish, please. Just on the FX assumption for the year, 3M, historically, has been one of the few companies that actually use financial hedges on FX. Is this still in place? And there's typically a lag when you use those hedges, so -- versus what you're seeing in the spot market? Just what's -- I can see you've got that 1% to 2% in guidance, but are the hedges at play? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, we do cash flow hedging, Deane, and that's been done even before my time. The team continues to do that as per the rules that are out there. For the first quarter, it was a -- FX was a $0.04 headwind and then on a revenue, it was a 2% headwind. If you just take -- and it's very volatile, it's all due to the strength of the US dollar. But if you just had to snap the chalk line a week ago and say, if that's what the trend is for the future, I would say on a revenue basis, it's somewhere between 1% to 2% impact. And then from an EPS perspective, it's a $0. 05 to $0.10 headwind we've taken $0.04, so then you'll have another $0.01 to $0.06 again, it's very volatile, Dean. So, it's really hard. I'm just giving you a point in time based on just snapping the chalk line a week ago on those currency rates. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Sorry about that. Thanks again for the -- it wasn't mute button issue. I just want to make that very clear. So, -- thanks again. So, just to put a finer point on the guide. I mean you've acknowledged the dollar stronger raw material pressure, China, Europe. So, lots of incremental headwinds, but what is the offset to that, Monish, in terms of keeping the range essentially unchanged? Monish Patolawala : So I'll start with just \u2013 you take the top line growth at 2% to 5% that we came into the year with, we continue to see that, Nigel, play itself out. If you take GDP IPI, that's growing, give or take, 3% to 4%. And you take auto build rates, which are still at the 5% growth rate. We have told you we can get 300 to 500 basis points of out build in the long term. You saw in this quarter, the team did on a negative 5% order growth rate they came in at plus \u2013 were flat. So it's 500 basis points. Health care started slow in January and February, we still see ourselves getting to in US elective procedures, 95% to 100%. You look at OCS or oral care, we are starting to see that back. Again, January was down due to the Omicron variant, but we have seen that back up. And then consumer is \u2013 we said low to mid-single digits. That's where they delivered in the first quarter. So that remains as is. So I would say when you look at all of this from a macro perspective for the year as a whole, it's \u2013 we still see ourselves in that range of 2% to 5%. And of course, we continue to get more price to offset the inflation. So that's number one. I would say, secondly, we did bring out the second quarter, because we wanted you all to know what we are seeing from a headwinds perspective, I'm sure you're hearing it from all industries, and we are not telling you anything new that you haven't heard from others. And then on EPS, which is $10.75 to $11.25, I go back to volume gives us the best leverage. So the 2% to 5% growth there plus the continued work that the teams are doing to drive productivity in the factories, strategic sourcing, continuing to be smart about investments in the growth productivity and sustainability. All of that put together, we see the calculus that gets us to the $10.75 to the $11.25, and that's what we are working towards. I think things will play out as they will play out in the short run. But again, I go back to long-term growth about macro margin expansion and cash, it's clearly doable and these short-term headwinds will all play itself out. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And I know we're running late here. So \u2013 but it seems like you're working around the Belgium facility issue, which is just good news. But it seems to me \u2013 and maybe this is a question for Mike, that Belgium was a symptom of a broader problem, which is to date, we've had litigation actions against PFAS, and now it seems to be more operational. And your Germany, I know was supposing to phase out PFAS products. California has got some similar proposals as well. So how is the Board thinking about this, number one? And then secondly, how material could this be for 3M longer term? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Mike Roman : Yeah. Nigel, maybe I'll just try to kind of frame this up a little bit. So there are two parts to what we're managing in Zwijndrecht and I would say, in our manufacturing sites around the world, there's a historical impact of the PFAS chemistries, PFOA-PFOS that we exited and announced the exit almost 20 years ago now and \u2013 or exit almost 20 years ago. And then there's ongoing operations. And so we're working on both of those in Zwijndrecht as the charge that we announced in March was to resolve remediation related to that historical PFOA-PFOS manufacturing. And then we're working with the authorities and Flanders around an operating permit going forward. And that's something that we've been doing around the world at our five sites with regulatory authorities and continue to do that. It's \u2013 PFAS continues to be a critical PFAS substances. There's more than 4,000 of them. We continue to have some PFAS in our products that is critical to customer needs in health care, electronics, automotive. And so the -- its something we\u2019re managing with those sites, managing with those authorities and something we'll keep you updated on as appropriate as we go forward. Nigel Coe : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we had a good start to the year with solid growth, sequential margin expansion and strong cash generation. We are positioned for a successful 2022, and we'll stay focused on taking care of our customers, driving growth and improving our operational performance. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Affairs Officer. Please note, that Mike's and Monish's formal comments this morning will be longer than past quarters given the announcements that we made this morning. Therefore, when we get to Q&A, please keep it to one question and 1 follow-up so that we can try and get to everyone as efficiently as possible. Also note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today is an exciting and important day for 3M. We are positioning our company for future success by creating more opportunity while reducing uncertainty. We plan to spin off our healthcare business, which will result in two world-class public companies that are global leaders with significant growth opportunities in the respective markets. We intend to execute a tax free spin-off creating a global diversified healthcare technology leader. New 3M will remain a leading global material science innovator, serving customers across a range of diverse and attractive end markets. Each company will be well capitalized, more agile and focused and well positioned for long-term success. Also, we are proactively taking steps to resolve litigation related to Combat Arms earplugs. Aero Technologies, a 3M subsidiary has voluntarily elected to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings. This process is intended to resolve claims related to Combat Arms in a manner that is efficient and equitable. 3M has not filed for Chapter 11. Both 3M and Aero expect to continue to operate in the ordinary course. And as we announced earlier in our earnings press release, 3M continues to deliver in a challenging environment with adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 in the second quarter. We also posted organic growth of nearly 5%, excluding the impact of disposable respirators and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Monish will cover our Q2 results in detail after my remarks. Please turn to slide four. Now, is the right time for 3M to act as we position our company to win in a rapidly changing world. As I shared at our investor meeting in February, disciplined portfolio management is foundational to our growth strategy. Our Board and management team actively evaluate strategic options to drive long-term sustainable growth. The importance of portfolio management has never been greater, especially given the extraordinary macroeconomic changes brought about at the pandemic. I'll speak to Healthcare in a moment, but let me first talk about the strong businesses that will make up new 3M. Our market-leading business groups are aligned to highly attractive end markets with tremendous opportunities in front of them. Each of these business groups grew above 8% in 2021 and are delivering solid results in a challenging environment this year. Together, these businesses make up an outstanding portfolio that actively leverages our world-class capabilities. As global megatrends have accelerated, many of those trends demand our customer-driven innovations that aligned our growth priorities. Areas such as electronics, safety, mobility, digitization, home improvement, and sustainability, all represent significant opportunities for 3M. An important example of our strategic portfolio management is the progress we have made in health care. Through organic investments in innovation, strategic M&A and updates to our operating model, we have positioned Healthcare to be successful as a stand-alone enterprise. In 2019, we acquired Acelity and M Modal, establishing our leadership in Advanced Wound Care and in Health Information Systems. Also, we have divested drug delivery and are in the process of separating our food safety business. Our business group-led operating model, which we implemented in 2020 has also enabled our businesses and R&D to be closer to our customers. These actions, in addition to Healthcare's strong capabilities are why we feel now is the right time to formally operate as a stand-alone healthcare leader, especially given important trends that favor our business. With shifting demographics, growing demand for virtual and in-home care, a focus on reducing rehospitalizations, advances in healthcare IT systems, and a growing focus on delivering better patient care at a lower cost, our Healthcare business is at the intersection of data, analytics, and technologies needed to deliver precision medicine. Both companies will sharpen their focus to continue investing and winning in global end markets and have greater flexibility to strategically deploy capital, drive innovation, and accelerate growth. Turning now to slide five. Our actions will drive long-term value for our shareholders. New 3M and Healthcare will tailor their capital allocation and investments to drive innovation and growth. As leaders in their markets, their enhanced focus will help position each to respond even faster to shifting industry dynamics and needs. They will both offer distinct and compelling investment profiles appealing to different investor bases. These actions will help unlock and unleash value for 3M and the Healthcare business and chart an exciting course for our future. At the same time, we are also working to reduce uncertainty by efficiently and equitably resolving Combat Arms Earplug Litigation. I will now provide more detail about our planned spin-off of our Healthcare business and the opportunities this will create. Please turn to slide seven. Each business will be financially strong leaders in their respective industries. 3M will be an approximately $26.8 billion business and remain a leading provider of innovative solutions for a broad diverse range of end markets, including industrial, safety, automotive, electronics and consumer. Each of these businesses benefit from 3M science and innovation. Our Healthcare business drove $8.6 billion in sales in 2021, which includes approximately $400 million in revenue from our food safety business. We intend to complete the previously announced separation of the food safety business through a split-off transaction with a targeted closing date of September 1, 2022, subject to approval by Neogen shareholders, in addition to other customary closing conditions. Our go-forward healthcare business will build upon strong positions in attractive markets, including wound care, oral care, healthcare IT and biopharma filtration. Next slide, please. With our fundamental strengths in science and technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and iconic brands, we are well positioned to capitalize on and invest in key megatrends. A hallmark of 3M is our ability to leverage unique and differentiated technologies across our organization, allowing us to create new solutions required by a world where we are seeing accelerated demand for innovation and sustainability. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio with discipline and focus, generate strong margins and cash flow and grow earnings by improving operating rigor. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include investing in organic growth, an attractive dividend, strategic M&A and finally, share repurchases. Next slide, please. As we look ahead, innovation, talent and operations will remain core strengths for new 3M. We will drive more customer-focused innovation leverage data and insights from our retail partners and connect with customers through advanced e-commerce strategies. We will share technology platforms and leverage R&D across the enterprise, which will help drive growth in all of our businesses.  Attracting and retaining talented people are top priorities. We will connect them through greater flexibility with our Work Your Way model and continuously strengthen our culture of innovation. We will also advance our capabilities through digitization to provide unique solutions and achieve greater end-to-end performance across our global operations.  Our innovative manufacturing expertise will continue to be a differentiator and to ensure greater connectivity to customers, we will enhance our service and streamline our operating model. We are equally excited for the future of our Healthcare business, which I will explain on Slide 10.  Our Healthcare business enables better, smarter and safer care and we'll be well positioned to support customer needs and make the most of attractive opportunities, including a growing focus on infection prevention to help providers reduce related rehospitalizations, hospitals increasing investments and improvements in clinical and operational workflows to drive efficiencies and improve patient experiences, more frequent use of biologics as a first-line choice of treatment. In addition, medicines are becoming more complex and advanced, requiring specialized, tailored solutions. And the combination of material science and digital science, especially within oral care, is changing the patient experience for the better. With our deep and diverse portfolio of trusted brands, global capabilities, regulatory expertise and leading positions in attractive segments, we expect the health care business to generate strong recurring revenues, margins and cash flow. Next slide, please. We are excited about the health care business we have built, with intention and a clear focus on helping improve the health of people around the world. Our business is powered by core strengths, including our proven leadership in multiple care pathways, our position in attractive end markets, an innovation mindset, customer relationships, regulatory expertise and operational excellence. These strengths enable strong sales growth and profitability and importantly, deliver better patient care. Next slide, please. We are well positioned in large and growing health care end markets, which are expected to grow at a strong and steady rate over the next several years. Our wound care business is a world leader and comprises a portfolio of innovative products. Our oral care business is another leading platform, which has developed award-winning innovations. Health care information systems are increasingly essential, as providers seek to deliver better care through comprehensive data and insights. Our biopharma filtration products are critical to manufacturing potentially life-saving medical devices, vaccines, drugs and therapeutics. Now let me turn to some of the specifics of the transaction on the next slide. 3M plans to pursue a tax-free spin-off and retain a 19.9% stake, which we expect to monetize over time. We expect health care will be spun off with net leverage of 3 to 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA and will delever rapidly, given the business' strong cash flow. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we anticipate completing this transaction by the end of 2023, and we anticipate no change in 3M's capital allocation priorities through separation. In addition, 3M will retain responsibility for non-health care-related litigation, including Combat Arms Earplugs and PFAS. Over the next several months, we will begin our work to stand up these two companies, and we'll share updates as we progress. Now let me provide some additional background on Combat Arms litigation. Please turn to slide 15. To provide some context, in 2008, 3M acquired Aearo Technologies, which manufactured Combat Arms Earplugs. Since the acquisition, Aearo has continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of 3M. These products provided effective hearing protection when used properly, and we stand by their performance. The US military continues to rely on 3M products, including newer versions of the Combat Arms Earplugs. Nonetheless, there has been an extraordinary increase in litigation related to Combat Arms. As of June 30, 2022, there were approximately 115,000 filed claims and an additional 120,000 claims on an administrative docket. The multi-district litigation process and the highly variable outcomes it has generated has not provided certainty or clarity. We believe that litigating these cases individually could take years, if not decades. We want to do right by veterans and all stakeholders, and we expect the steps we are taking today will provide greater certainty as we take action to efficiently and equitably resolve claims related to Combat Arms. We have made the decision to adopt a new legal strategy. So let me provide a little more context on the actions we are taking. Aearo has voluntarily elected to use well-established Chapter 11 procedures to resolve this litigation. Aearo will indemnify 3M for all liabilities related to Combat Arms and certain discontinued Aearo respirator mask products. 3M has entered into a funding agreement and has committed to fund a trust of $1 billion to resolve all claims determined to be entitled to compensation. This amount is based on the analysis of an experienced estimator of claims in Chapter 11. In addition, we are committing $240 million to cover projected case related expenses. 3M will provide additional funding if required under the terms of the agreement. By taking these actions, we expect to provide greater certainty and clarity and help funds go to plaintiffs with claims that are determined to be entitled to compensation sooner. This will help reduce the cost and time that could otherwise be required to litigate thousands of cases. Let me now say a few words about our plans to manage PFAS. 3M stands by our record of environmental stewardship. We are already deploying state-of-the-art technology that will help us achieve our goal of a 99% reduction in PFAS discharges from our operations. We are making progress against our goals of improving water quality, reducing water use, reducing plastic use and achieving carbon neutrality. In addition, we continue to remediate at sites where 3M historically manufactured or disposed of PFOA and PFOS. Now specifically to PFAS related litigation. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves. We are preparing our defense for upcoming milestones in the litigation process, and we are well-advised of our options. Next slide. We are excited about the future of 3M. Our actions today will provide greater focus for our organization. Before I turn it over to Monish, I want to reiterate a few key takeaways. Our investments in innovation, our portfolio management strategy our realigned operating model will power our future growth. We will have dedicated teams to help facilitate focused execution of our actions announced today. Our planned tax-free spin-off will result in a leading global diversified health care technology company. We will create more opportunity for both 3M and the newly stand-alone health care business through this transaction, with two public companies well-positioned to drive future success. In addition, we are taking action to efficiently and equitably resolve Combat Arms litigation. Finally, we remain focused on delivering in a challenging environment. Now I will turn it to Monish to provide an update on our Q2 performance and an updated outlook for the year. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide 17. The 3M team executed well and delivered solid Q2 results by remaining focused on serving our customers, while navigating continued supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures along with the geopolitical and COVID dynamics. Second quarter total sales were $8.7 billion, which increased 1% on an organic basis versus last year's 21% comparison. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.48. We continue to experience strong demand across most end markets. However, a couple of items had a negative impact on overall Q2 results which we had highlighted during the quarter. First, as forecasted, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million; and second, the Greater China region's COVID-related lockdowns resulted in a sales decline of approximately $140 million year-on-year. The impact was lower than the $300 million headwind we had anticipated as the reopening of our facilities in June went better than anticipated. Our China team did a tremendous job adding additional shifts to ramp up production, distribution, and drive productivity to serve our customers. Adjusting for these two impacts, organic revenue growth was nearly 5% for the rest of 3M in the quarter. Also, the continued strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a foreign currency translation impact of minus four percentage points to Q2 total sales growth. This FX impact, combined with the China COVID-related lockdown, negatively impacted second quarter operating margins by nearly one percentage point and earnings by $0.24 per share versus our expectation of $0.30 as discussed during a conference in early June. We also continue to support our people and manage the business and supply chain impacts from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. We also announced additional investments to resolve matters related to our operations in Zwijndrecht and began the process of restarting manufacturing operations, which is progressing to plan. And finally, as I will expand upon later, we are updating our full year expectations, primarily to incorporate the impact of the strong US dollar, along with macroeconomic uncertainty. Please turn to slide 18, where I'll get into more details of the quarter. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q2 last year. First, we continue to benefit from selling price actions, restructuring savings, and strong spending discipline, which helped drive an improvement to underlying margins of 2.9 percentage points or $0.44 to earnings per share year-on-year. These actions helped to more than offset headwinds, including the forecasted decline in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted Q2 operating margins by 40 basis points and earnings by $0.09 a share. The previously mentioned China COVID-related lockdown, which resulted in a year-on-year headwind of 70 basis points to operating margins and $0.11 to earnings per share. And finally, as discussed during last year's second quarter earnings call, we realized a benefit to both operating margins and earnings in Q2 last year from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling, which led to a 100 basis point margin and $0.12 per share headwind to this year's second quarter. We also continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large attractive markets, including automotive, safety, healthcare, electronics, software, and home improvement. Moving on to raw materials and logistics. Inflationary pressures resulted in a year-on-year headwind of nearly $270 million in the quarter or a negative impact of 3.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.36 to earnings. Halfway through 2022, we have experienced approximately $480 million of raw materials and logistics headwinds versus our original full year expectation of $350 million to $450 million at the start of the year. We now anticipate this year full year headwind to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, which we continue to expect to offset through pricing actions. As I mentioned earlier, foreign currency translation was a negative 4 percentage point impact or a reduction of nearly $340 million in total sales and over $80 million in operating income net of hedging year-on-year. This resulted in a headwind of 10 basis points to margins and to $0.13 to earnings per share. Other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.10 per share year-on-year, driven by benefits from a lower share count and tax rate. Please turn to Slide 19. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion with conversion of 68%. Our year-on-year conversion performance was a result of a higher-than-expected increase in working capital, along with the cash impact from capitalization of R&D for US tax purposes. Working capital improvement is a big piece of how we keep generating good strong cash flow for 3M. The global supply chain and logistics environments remain challenging. The data analytics platform that we have created will help us to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning SKU rationalization and use of visualization tools. We expect the benefits of these efforts to start showing up in the second half and years to come. Capital expenditure was $384 million in the quarter and $808 million year-to-date or up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As we have communicated previously, share repurchases remained suspended in Q2 due to the pending food safety separation. We intend to complete the separation through a split-off with the closing date of September 1, subject to Neogen shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 4% as we continue to invest in the business. Please turn to Slide 21 for our business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 0.7% organically compared to last year's second quarter. This result included headwinds from the decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's organic growth by 5.7 percentage points, along with the COVID-related lockdowns in the Greater China region. Our personal safety business declined high single-digits organically, primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand. We continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as appropriate.  Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Abrasives, electrical markets and closure and masking businesses all grew low double digits organically. Roofing granules, automotive aftermarket and industrial adhesives and tapes, all delivered low single-digit organic growth. Safety and Industrial's second quarter adjusted operating income was $630 million, down 12% versus last year.  Adjusted operating margins were 21.5%, down 2.1 percentage points. Adjusted operating margins were impacted by China lockdowns and manufacturing productivity headwinds, which were partially offset by spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.  Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.3 billion, up 0.5% organically compared to last year. Organic growth was held back by the lockdowns in China, along with the ongoing impacts of the semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets.  Organic sales in our auto OEM business were up low single digits versus flat global car and light truck builds as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials and Commercial Solutions grew organically mid-single digits, while transportation safety was down high single digits. Second quarter operating income was $476 million, down 7% year-on-year.  Operating margins were 21%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds due to China's lockdowns and the continued shutdown during Q2 of certain operations in our Zwijndrecht factory. These impacts were partially offset by the strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring. Looking at our Healthcare business, which delivered strong quarter sales of $2.2 billion, with organic growth of 4.4%. Our medical solutions and oral care businesses increased low single digits organically. Second quarter US elective medical procedures and oral care volumes were approximately 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, up sequentially from Q1 levels.  Health Information Systems grew mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management. The separation and purification business increased high single digits with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines. And finally, food safety was flat year-on-year. Healthcare second quarter operating income was $494 million, down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.7%, down 2.6 percentage points with strong adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 30%. Year-on-year, operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity, investments in the business and costs related to the food safety separation. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. Lastly, our consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion or down 2.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year's 18% comparison. The home improvement business was down high single digits organically, while consumer health and safety declined low single digits as both businesses were up against strong comparisons from a year ago.  Our Stationary and Office business performed well, up mid-single digits year-on-year and Homecare was up low single digits. Consumer's operating income was $247 million, down 15% compared to last year. Operating margins were 18.5%, down 2.2 percentage points year-on-year. Our consumer business operating margins were impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. Please turn to Slide 23 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. As you know, the macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. For example, improving build rate trends in automotive; continued strong demand in semiconductor, data center and factory automation; increasing healthcare elective procedure volumes; and a strong bounce back in China, following April and May COVID-related lockdowns. However, there are also continued challenges and areas of concern that we are monitoring, including the stubborn and evolving impacts of COVID; global supply chain and logistics challenges; persistent and broad-based inflation, which is pressuring consumers' purchasing power and shifting spending patterns; softening trends in consumer electronics; and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in Europe.  We are working through these challenges and are taking actions such that we expect to offset the majority of these headwinds. However, as I mentioned earlier, the strength of the US dollar is having an increasing impact on our top and bottom line, which is the primary factor driving our update to full year guidance. Foreign currency translation is now expected to be a full year headwind on of minus 4% versus minus 1% previously.  This FX headwind is resulting in a reduction of over $1 billion in annual sales and is also accounting for nearly 80% of the adjustment in our full year earnings expectation. Therefore, we now expect full year earnings in the range of $10.30 to $10.80 versus a prior range of $10.75 to $11.25.  Given our first half performance, along with the continued uncertain environment, we also believe it is prudent to adjust our organic growth expectations. Therefore, we now expect full year organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus a prior range of 2% to 5%. And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%.  Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the third quarter. First, we currently anticipate an approximate 5 percentage point headwind to total sales from foreign currency translation. While build rate forecast for automotive have moderated, we see easier comps here in Q3 versus last year. US medical elective procedure volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, while oral care volumes are estimated at approximately 90%. We expect a headwind of $100 million to $200 million year-on-year from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand. We continue to closely watch weakening consumer electronics demand trends and overall consumer sentiment and spending. And finally, looking at raw materials and logistics costs, we anticipate a Q3 year-on-year headwind of approximately to $225 million, which we expect to be able to navigate and offset to price actions. To wrap up, our team delivered 1 percentage organic sales growth in the quarter, 21% adjusted margins and generated $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication, as they continue delivering for our customers. While the macro environment continues to be extremely fluid, the 3M team remains focused on serving our customers and delivering a strong second half of the year. We will remain focused on investing in favorable macro trends, increasing operating rigor through a focus on deep root causes and driving working capital intensity to further strengthen cash flow. I'm excited about the future of new 3M and our health care business. We believe that today's announcements position the company to drive significant long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Our businesses and capital structure are strong, and we are well positioned for success. That concludes my remarks for the second quarter. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Mike Roman : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. First of all, congratulations on achieving these key milestones. I'm sure the team worked incredibly hard to achieve that. So congrats. Mike Roman : Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Obin : My first question, so maybe not for Mike, not for Monish, Kevin is on the phone as well. So we're getting a lot of questions about just the structure for the Combat Arms. Kevin, could you just talk about the process for sort of ring fencing the Combat Arms liability. You highlighted an estimator -- how much of it is sort of this -- how much of this estimate is sort of discretionary in nature? How much of it is based on precedents? Just maybe explain the process a little bit better to us, because my understanding is that it is a fairly complex process to come up with a number, but any help would be useful. Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. Maybe, Andrew, maybe I'll start with it, and Kevin can add some details as well. So as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Aearo Technologies operating entity in 3M is voluntarily taking on this liability. And it's really about us, 3M stepping up to do what's right here. Do right by veterans and drive more certainty, drive better clarity for everyone involved. As we talked about, we are committed to fund the trust, and this is based on the analysis by an experienced estimator of claims. The third-party that we're working with an economic consulting firm, Bates White is the one that developed the estimate for us. We believe the $1 billion is the appropriate amount based on that expert analysis. And we are -- as part of this process, we'll provide additional funding if required under the terms of the agreement, so that's the basis for that $1 billion. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything to add to that? Kevin Rhodes : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I'll just add that the analysis will be explained in the next report that will be reviewed as part of the Chapter 11 proceeding. It's important to note that the Chapter 11 court will oversee this process and the claimants will be represented as well. And the goal is to have the court help Aearo establish this trust funded by 3M, as Mike said, and those seeking compensation can present their claims to the trust rather than going through the litigation process on a case-by-case basis. Andrew Obin : And does this number get updated on a regular basis in the Q or intra-quarter, or it's just we're going to get big updates as things evolve or no updates at all? Kevin Rhodes : So this is the commitment to fund the trust of $1 billion at the end of the process when the trust is established, that's when the proceeding will be concluded. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. And just a follow-up question. I guess this question is for Mike. There's a lot of talk about recession, right? There are headlines that we're technically in a recession. You did address inflation, consumer slowing. But just from your perspective, you have such broad exposure to the economy. What do you think we are in the economic cycle? And how does it sort of figure in your planning for the second half of the year and as you start initial budgeting process for 2023? Thanks a lot. Mike Roman : Yes. Andrew, maybe I'll start. In Q2, we saw most of our end markets remain strong. And like everybody else, we saw some softening in the macro, both IPI and GDP. As we look forward, it's really important in the current backdrop -- economic backdrop to look at individual markets. And we're seeing some positive signs. We see elective procedures continuing to improve kind of sequentially as we go. We'll see a second half improvement in build rates for automotive versus first half. There's some areas of softness in our individual markets. We're looking at consumer electronics for example that has now an outlook for the total year that will be negative growth for that segment. We're watching, I would say, consumer and retail spending closely with the focus on inventory and the retail customers and also just the general dynamic around spending is some of the challenges with inflation causing some shifts and where consumers are spending their money. So we're watching that closely. There's a few other areas that really are looking at it. We see Europe and really broadly EMEA down in the second quarter and impacted by geopolitical impacts, COVID, I would say, inflation impacting. So just general, some softness there as well. So all of this, when you put it together, it's leaving us with some uncertainty around the economic outlook. So that's the way I would wrap it up as we go into the second half, we're cautious about where the economy is going. We're watching it closely. Monish Patolawala : Andrew, I have to add FX, foreign exchange, down 4% for the year, down 5% for the third quarter. As you know, that strong dollar does impact our earnings. And that's why 80% of our guide down was due to FX. So that's the other piece I would add to Mike's comments. Andrew Obin : Really appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning guys, and congrats on the health care spin announcement. That seems like a smart move. I hate to chime in Monish here. But on slide 18, since you guys don't give us price anymore, can you just give us at least some sense of what -- you've got a $0.36 raw material impact, if price came close to offsetting that, or just give us a little bit of sense of the progress you've made on the price cost? Monish Patolawala : Sure, Scott. I'll take that. As I've mentioned before, the teams have done a very disciplined approach to pricing actions across multiple markets, multiple geographies. As you know, we don't do just cost plus pricing. So we take into account our competitive position. We take into account market situations, the inflation that has by commodity. So when you put all that together, I would say, between the businesses and the product line, that's somewhere between low single digits to high single digits. But if I do a weighted average of that, I would say mid-single digits, Scott, is where we came in on price. So we did offset inflation. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are managing inflation through pricing actions. And in the second half, we continue to see broad-based inflation. So we updated our inflation guide to nearly 750 to 850 versus the earlier range we had, which was in the 350 to 450 range. And even there, we continue to manage that inflation, we continue to take price. I don't know if I answered your question, but I think that was your question. Scott Davis : Yeah. No, that's helpful, Monish. And just going back to Andrew's question on slide 15, where you talk about Aearo Technology is being always operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Is there some sort of -- is there a litmus test there on whether it was truly integrated or funds coming, or the ERP systems coming old? I mean, I just remember and effetely from the asbestos days that there were lines it couldn't cross to be able to keep something separate and put a liability into a separate entity like this? Kevin Rhodes : Yeah. So Aearo, I'll take this. So Aearo has been a wholly-owned subsidiary since the 2008 acquisition. It has continued to operate and it's important to note that the Aero entities have been involved in the Combat Arms litigation from the beginning. They are named as co-defendants in the litigation and they launched, manufactured and actually sold the majority of the Combat Arms Earplugs that issued before the 2008 acquisition by 3M. Monish Patolawala : And Scott, we don't see a reason why we can't have our systems, especially your question on ERPs, separate the two entities up. Scott Davis : Okay. So ultimately, there will be a judge's ruling on that, I would assume, perhaps. Is that correct? Kevin Rhodes : Yes, it's correct. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Thanks Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing by region? I know you mentioned Europe and potential weakness there in the second half. But you also talked about China and stronger-than-expected improvement in June, and it was down 8% in Q2. So what do you think growth looks like for the rest of the year there? And how worried are you about a bigger slowdown in Europe? Mike Roman : Yeah. It's maybe just to give you those two areas in particular. So China, as Monish highlighted in his prepared remarks, we saw better-than-expected recovery in June to the lockdowns that we were seeing than the soft start to April, May that we talked a bit about in China. So, as we go forward and for the quarter, you're right, it's down high single-digits year-on-year. GDP still looks positive in Q2. As we go forward, part of the answer is going to be how quickly does it recover? What is the impact going forward of COVID as any potential additional lockdown. So, it's really looking at where we go there. I mean China continues to be an important market for 3M. It's -- the macro backdrop shows a good positive backdrop, but it's really going to be how all things progress relative to COVID and the recovery from COVID than what else comes our way as we go through the quarter and through the rest of the year. Back to Europe, our declines there were really led by Consumer and Safety and Industrial. Healthcare was still growing strong in the quarter. We saw some strong growth in individual market segments. Back to my comments, the current outlook and the current growth is market-dependent as opposed to broad-based one view of everything. And so I think Europe is at it. We've got the geopolitical risks there. We've got the impact of the supply chain issues and challenges and inflation as well. So, down in the quarter and we think a soft outlook as we look at the second half. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Mike. And then maybe you could give a little more color into how the change in you're approaching the Combat Arms situations impacting your total litigation costs. Does it lower 3M's overall litigation costs even in the short to longer term? How does it work in terms of -- because you've been spending call it, 5% to 6% of EPS has been -- you've separated that for us. Does that now go down, up? How do we think about that with the change today? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So the way we work, Andrew, is when we came into the year, we had told you approximately $0.60 of adjusted earnings of litigation-related expenses. That number has been updated for three items. Item number one is the pretax charge that we will take as a part of the Combat Arms litigation, which is approximately $1.2 billion. The second one is the charge that we announced earlier in the quarter about our Zwijndrecht thing, which is $355 million. And for the year, that will be approximately $500 million. And then the item which was around $0.60 of litigation-related expenses now with the way this transaction will work out is around $0.55. So put all that together, that's approximately $2.2 billion of adjusted earnings for litigation-related and Zwijndrecht-related items. So hopefully, that answers your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Monish. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hey guys. good morning. Stephen Tusa : Hi Steve. Stephen Tusa : Are there any -- what are the risks around creating the structure for this entity? How do you kind of gauge the in this political environment, any kind of risk to not being able to kind of execute on this, or your lawyers kind of tell you it's pretty iron-clad? Mike Roman : Yes, Steve, there's certainly -- there are process steps that we will go through as we file today for the Aearo Technologies. And so there are -- we have to work through each of those steps. So, there's always decisions that are made along the way. So, I think that's part of gaining certainty as we go and we'll keep everybody updated. I don't know, Kevin, do you want to make any comments specifically? Kevin Rhodes : Yes. Certainly, while most Chapter 11 proceedings are contested, Steven. We've -- we're prepared to move forward and we believe the applicable law supports our position as we move forward into this process. And the goal, again, is to remove uncertainty to set up a more efficient and equitable process for establishing a fund to compensate claimants who are entitled to compensation as opposed to the process of continuing to litigate on a claim-by-claim basis. Stephen Tusa : Got it. Helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on, how you're kind of preparing for a potential pullback in demand more broadly. When you look at what happened in COVID, all you guys took a lot of temporary cost out able to defend the margins pretty nicely. What are kind of the contingencies this time around? Did the things -- are things going to be a little bit different or should we look at COVID as kind of like the same playbook if we do see a significant macro pullback in the next couple of quarters? Mike Roman : Yes, Steve, I think as you've seen, we manage into recessions and through any kind of slowdowns with a broad-based approach. And we'll do what's needed given the economic conditions. As I said, we're watching how each of the market demand areas are developing, how the overall macro is developing, what's going on, on the global economic outlook. And we'll take actions as required and it will be -- in what we do in our factories and how we manage our commercial businesses and how we operate the company. So, we'll keep you updated as we get a better view. Stephen Tusa : Excellent. Thanks. Mike Roman : Definitely, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to go back to the bankruptcy filing. So when you put Aearo into Chapter 11, do you move EBITDA in that business? How does that work? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Nigel. Depending on how the bankruptcy proceeding goes, the plan will be to deconsolidate that entity, but the overall revenue and earnings are immaterial in the grand scheme of things. Nigel Coe : Okay. Okay. We'll move off-line there. And then is the -- I mean there is controversy around the structure and those appeals and the congressional bickering about it. But how contingent is the Healthcare separation on a successful filing for Aearo? I mean is one continent in the other? So, can you still go ahead and separate Healthcare even if the filing for Aearo is unresolved? Mike Roman : Yes. Nigel, we did announce both actions today. They're really the result of separate kind of strategies and decisions. Healthcare spin was based on, as you know, we actively manage our portfolio. We look at broadly where to invest in our portfolio where acquisitions make sense and how do we get the most value out of it and that's what was behind the decision to ultimately spin the Healthcare.  We've invested in strategies to create a stronger Healthcare company. It's is well positioned to succeed and have a great future as a stand-alone company and that really drove that decision. The decision to really take the steps related to Combat Arms Litigation came out of really, first and foremost, the result of the bellwether trial. They were highly variable. We believe it would take years to litigate those claims. And so given a choice between a costly litigation process, we -- in a better, fair, more efficient resolution. That's what drove the decision to step into the new actions that we're taking. So they were -- they happened to be announced in the same day, but they're really based on separate strategies. And both really helping to set us up for, I think, well positioned for, as we said at the top, greater opportunity with the spin and more certainty with the actions we're taking related to Combat Arms. Nigel Coe : Thanks Mike. And then if I can just follow up. We get a lot of questions from investors around, obviously, the $1 billion is what you put in initially. But obviously, the plaintiffs will be at a much, much higher level. So a seam in the structure is approved. How does that gap get bridged between the $1 billion you putting in and, obviously, the plaintiffs are at a much, much higher level? How does that get resolved? Mike Roman : Well, based on what we're doing, there will be a separate process that will be a different process. Kevin can talk about how that proceeds. But there will be -- in the court that takes responsibility for these proceedings, they will oversee a process there. But we believe that, as I said, we're committed to a fund that was based on, we think, appropriate analysis from an expert outside firm. But Kevin can talk about the steps of that process and how that resolves. Kevin Rhodes : Yes. As part of the Chapter 11 proceeding, there will be a claims estimation process where the court oversees that process. And we believe that the $1 billion that we have committed based on the external analysis is sufficient to fund a trust for those claimants who are entitled to compensation. The proceedings will be the subject of expert reports overseen by the court. The claimants will be represented as well. And we believe this is a number that is required, the funding agreement. If necessary, 3M is prepared to provide additional funding to resolve this matter at the end of the process. Nigel Coe : Thanks, Kevin. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on both announcements. Mike Roman : Good morning, Joe. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Yes. My question is for Kevin, actually, because this is all fairly new to us. I'm just curious. Like, is there some kind of likelihood that the plaintiffs will come back and want their lawsuits to be heard outside of bankruptcy court? Kevin Rhodes : So, once the Chapter 11 filing is made, there's an automatic state as to the debtor entity, which, in this case, is Aearo Technologies. We are also asking for that automatic state to be extended to 3M. We are funding, according to the terms of the funding, indemnification agreement. We're committing to fund the trust to help the court set up a mechanism for compensation for those claimants entitled to compensation. We're providing that funding through Aearo. So we think we are entitled to as 3M and hope the court will extend the state of litigation to 3M, and that would put a stay on the existing litigation in state and federal court. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you guys maybe just provide a little bit more color around the timing, like how this structure actually helps to expedite the timing in getting the resolution with the potential payments? Kevin Rhodes : Yes. So the Chapter 11 case was just filed this morning. The court has not set a schedule yet. There have been a wide range of duration for other Chapter 11 filings to resolve litigation matters. We're hoping to work through the process and resolve the matter as quickly as possible. We hope that all parties will share that goal and move it along as expeditiously as the court's procedures permit. We'll certainly provide updates as the case progresses. And if you think about this in context, we've participated in the MDL process for the past three years, taking 16 cases through bellwether trials. We're now at the next step, which is to pair 1,500 cases for trials around the country while we await the outcomes of our appeals. So as compared to the process ahead to litigate each of these cases on a case-by-case basis, we believe that the Chapter 11 proceeding will be more expeditious and certainly, will provide more clarity and a way to more efficiently and equitably provide compensation to those who are entitled to it. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. So maybe just wanted to kind of clarify a couple of things on healthcare as there's been a lot of focus on Combat Arms. On the healthcare side, you've had margins down for several quarters now. I know Monish, you always say that volume leverage is the main driver of margins, but at healthcare, that hasn't seemed to be the case most recently. So just wondering kind of when those healthcare margins turn around? Are they going to be up year-on-year in the back half? And also on healthcare, is the plan that -- it's levered at 3, 3.5 times, is the plan you'd get that sort of step one the big dividend back to the RemainCo at that point when it spins out and then step to a year late, so you can start to monetize that just under 20% stake. Is that the way to think about the cash sort of from healthcare? Monish Patolawala : Yes. I think both great questions, Julian. I'd start with the first question on margins. As we told you, the EBITDA margins for the second quarter were 30%. As we have talked about before, when you compare to prior, you have to take into account the Acelity acquisition and its impact on purchase accounting, et cetera, which depresses the margins. And that's why I would look at EBITDA, which is 30% in the second quarter. For the year 2021, we ended at 31% EBITDA. So hopefully, that answers your question on that range. Back to, do we see it continuing to improve? Absolutely. I mean this is something that the business is doing a really nice job of continuing to manage inflation with price actions. They continue to drive productivity actions. And as the volume starts, which is back to your point, which is volumes drive the biggest leverage, as we are seeing elective procedures starting to go back up and hopefully, it doesn't get impacted by another wave of COVID, you're going to start seeing that business continue to drive the growth in that area. So that answers your question on margin. The team is quite focused on margin, quite focused on driving organizational efficiency through root cause. On your second question about how the dividend works, I'll start by saying, this is still 15, 18 months away. But the way it will work at that moment in time when that spin happens, there will be a dividend payout from healthcare, which currently we are saying is going to be levered 3 to 3.5 times with positioning for rapid deleveraging because of the strong cash flow that healthcare itself generate. As a part of that transaction, 3M will also retain 19.9% equity stake in our healthcare business that we can monetize over time. The whole purpose of -- the whole intent of this transaction is to be as tax efficient and tax-free, for which we will go ahead and file all the requirements that needed to make it tax-free -- and -- but we are in no rush right now to sell the stake once the spin happens, and we'll monetize it over time. And I think that gives us a lot more flexibility for us to pursue strategic options between the dividend that we get as well as the retained stake that we can monetize over time. Hope that helps, Julian. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thanks Monish. And then maybe a sort of more reskin of operating guidance question. So if I look at the new guidance, I think it implies 270-ish of earnings per quarter in the second half. You did about 250 in Q2. I don't think FX is getting easier in the back half. Organic volumes probably not better in the second half given the macros. So just trying to understand, what do you think is getting better in that back half versus the second quarter or the first half run rate? Because you're starting out with that FX headwind, maybe there's a little bit less of that in China $0.11 COVID hit. But anything else you'd call out to drive that step-up in earnings? Monish Patolawala : Sure, Julian. And I'll give you all the pieces, and I'll try to give you data between sequential and year-on-year. So it's confusing, my apologies upfront. But I'll just start first by saying, yes, FX, you're right, continues to be a pressure. As I've said in my prepared remarks, for the third quarter, FX is at 5%. For the year, it is at 4%. So that actually adds additional pressure first half to second half. But back to your points on the positives and negatives. So we'll start by one, again, in my prepared remarks, I said China, we still came in with a backlog that we expect to clear in the second half. You'll see that in the third and fourth quarter. We came in $140 million down on a year-over-year basis. So there's recovery there. Secondly, if you look at build rates in automotive, first half versus second half, they are up nearly 9%. However, for the year, they are up 5% versus earlier we thought the whole year would be up 9%. You're continuing to see strong demand in semiconductor data centers and factory automation. Third, elective procedures, which were in that range of 85% to 90% in the first quarter moved up to 90% to 95%, we expect that to come back to 100% by the end of fourth quarter. And then lastly, GDP and IPI is still forecasted to be up 3% to 4% -- 3% for the year versus when we started the year, it was 4%. So for the second half, they're still protecting -- projecting a GDP up. On the flip side, on the things, to your point, that have become negative, we talked about FX, we are still seeing the stubborn and evolving impacts of COVID. Supply chain and logistics pressures continue. We are going to see higher inflation in the second half, but we are managing that inflation with price and offsetting that. We are watching consumer behavior because the broad-based inflation is having an impact on consumers' purchasing power. And then we are seeing softening trends in consumer electronics, especially in TVs, but again, if you look at smartphones on a half-over-half basis, smartphones are supposed to be up around 7% to 8%. However, on a year-over-year basis, they're down 4%, okay?  So I'm just giving you some data points and hopefully, that helps. And then the last one, Mike already talked about was geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in Europe. But with all that said, I just want to make sure you do understand the team is doing a great job of continuing to manage this, making sure we're doing whatever it takes to first deliver for our customers because that's our most important priority, spending cost discipline, but at the same time, continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Because as we think about it, Julian, long-term, all these trends will play themselves out. There are great areas for investment for new 3M, for Healthcare, and we want to keep making sure we're investing for the long run. So, all these actions that we are taking are all about setting both these businesses up to be successful in the long run. Sorry for the long answer, but I just want to make sure you got the data points. Julian Mitchell : Thank you for the details. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for all the details this morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a question on maybe kind of the perspective capital allocation strategy for RemainCo. You said kind of through the separation, no real change, but just given kind of the focus of the liabilities and the cash coming out with healthcare free cash flow margins being pretty high. Any change in the way folks should think about something like a dividend policy going forward? Mike Roman : Yes, Josh, I would say I'd start with we're continuing to focus on driving growth and our capital allocation priorities reflect that. And then they will remain unchanged. It's first and foremost, about investing in our business. It's about paying an attractive dividend, a high priority for us and continues to be so looking at strategic M&A that can add value and deliver on greater opportunities for the company. And then it's returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. And we continue to see that as our set of priorities as we go forward. When you look at new 3M, it's going to be a very strong, focused, well-capitalized business, a leader in highly attractive markets, as we've been talking about on the call. We'll have tremendous cash flow in that business, a strong balance sheet. And as Monish just highlighted, with the proceeds from the spin and the 19.9% retained stake that we can monetize over time, it will get stronger. So, we are -- we will be well positioned to continue to execute those capital priorities and continue to create value. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just -- I know the historical kind of framework on 3M or the portfolio rationale was that a lot of the IP was domiciled at corporate. I think there's some more diverse assets in Health Care, maybe than some of the other industrial businesses. But are there any dissynergies by virtue of either some of the IP or manufacturing process sourcing that kind of gets separated there when Health Care leaves? Mike Roman : Yes, Josh, we've long talked about the benefit our businesses have in leveraging the fundamental strengths of 3M. And they've certainly been important to building the Healthcare business, the technologies that we have are unique and differentiated technologies, our manufacturing capabilities, our global capabilities and our brands. And Healthcare as you touched on, with our portfolio strategies, we've built a stronger Healthcare business. We've done it with organic investments and sometimes leveraging some of those key technologies. We've added acquisitions, significant part of the business now with Acelity and M Modal coming in as part of the business. We've also stepped in to really focus that business through the divestiture of drug delivery and soon the separation of the food safety business. So, all of that has positioned Healthcare not only to be a strong stand-alone company, well positioned to be able to execute those same strategies moving forward. There's always some connectivity to the technologies manufacturing at 3M.  The \u2013 I would say, the connection between Healthcare and the rest of the company is more limited than the three businesses that will make up new 3M. We'll be able to manage that separation well, we think, especially with the focus that Healthcare has on those specific markets. So -- it's been an important part of building it. We think it's well positioned with what we can do in the spin to be able to take it forward. Monish Patolawala : Josh, I just want to add a few more things to what Mike just said. We're going to have dedicated teams that are going to drive the separation. Also, just looking at precedent of other sprints publicly, plus some of the experience that we have had with our divestitures in the healthcare space, we believe the separation cost is going to be somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will get played out overtime. Some of it will start now and some of it will play out over the next 24 months. But again, it's quite early in the process. The teams are starting to get ramped up as we get and learn more, we'll definitely keep you posted. Josh Pokrzywinski : That\u2019s great. All the best guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : A couple of cleanup questions here. The first, just -- this wasn't clear, but is the Board considering any other divestitures or spin or is Remainco 3M portfolio going to be as is on a go-forward basis? Mike Roman : Yes, Deane, our portfolio strategy, it's a continual strategy. We're always evaluating where we want to make change in our portfolio, adding through M&A, managing to optimize the value. So that's something I will continue really as we go forward. I talk a lot about new 3M. We really believe the three businesses that make up that new 3M company will be strong, well positioned for success in their markets. They will leverage well the technology, I guess the heart of 3M, the fundamental strengths of 3M.  So, it's -- it will be a continual process that we -- and strategy that's important. I think our portfolio strategy really complementing what we do with innovation. We're driving innovation, creating new solutions for customers, building new businesses. At the same time, portfolio management make sure we're looking broadly at where we're creating the greatest value and how do we need to think differently about it. So that's not going to change as we execute through the spin. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just want to understand, is there a scenario similar to what you're doing in combat arms for PFAS, where you would consider a similar bankruptcy structure. Is this related to this, it wasn't clear in the filing today. Maybe this is a technical question for Kevin. But are you \u2013 is this being filed under a 105A bankruptcy structure? Because it certainly sounds that because that would require all of those sign-ups and approvals, which would suggest there's going to be an extended process there to get to the finish line? Mike Roman : Yes, Deane maybe I'll take the PFAS part of that question, and then I'll let Kevin answer the 105A question. So, on PFAS, we continue to be focused on practically managing our environmental stewardship and stepping up and following through on our commitments there. We're vigorously defending ourselves in the cases that we have with PFAS. And we're looking to reasonably resolve, remediate where we can. We expect PFAS is going to play out over years. And I would probably leave it at we're well advised of our options. Deane Dray : Understood. And Kevin? Kevin Rhodes : Yes. So we believe that 105(a) does provide authority as well as other provisions of the bankruptcy code, given the Aero technologies liabilities that are included. And so our filings are being completed today, and those will spell out the various bases for seeking the relief that we've asked the Chapter 11 court to provide. Deane Dray : Will you also pledge your insurance assets? Kevin Rhodes : So our insurance assets are part of the ability to -- of funds that we can tap into to fund the trust. If those assets will be the provided, as well as other assets from the company to provide the trust. And I just -- one point to clarify that, it's the Combat Arms liabilities as well as the -- some legacy, some discontinued Aearo Technologies respirator and mask claims, which are part of the filing as well. Some of those are for asbestos exposure, which are under 24G of the code as well. Deane Dray : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Roman : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Just maybe a couple of questions on the business. I mean, looking at inventory, how would you categorize inventory in the channel versus what's ideal? And I think probably the biggest question would be around how you would view your consumer inventory? Mike Roman : Yes. Nicole, it's something we watch closely always. It's something that gives us a good indication of the sell-through of each of our businesses. There are certainly some areas that we've seen some inventory build up there related to COVID lockdowns, as an example. We've added some inventory and built some inventory ahead of some ERP go-live actions that we're taking. When we look at the channel inventory, it's been relatively stable. It's having to react to the same kind of supply chain challenges that we are seeing and react to it, disruptions in supply, logistics challenges. So it's a little more dynamic than usual, but pretty well aligned with what we're seeing in terms of demand. We're watching consumer closely. There was elevated inventory in the channel as part of that. That's something that has been very publicly talked about that retail leaders are working through. We're seeing some of that as well. We still see strong sell-out point-of-sale demand there, so something that we're watching closely. And again, it's -- I would say it's more dynamic, but maybe except for something like retail inventory pretty well in line with expected demand. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on price cost. So some kind of key commodities have started to come down. At what point could that start to impact your margin positively. Like is that as soon as could impact the back half of 2022, or is that more of a 2023 margin dynamic at this stage? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Nicole. And we watch this closely. As you know, we have exposure to multiple feedstocks, luckily not one of them is overly material. You look at polypropylene, you look at resin, you look at logistics, airfreight costs, et cetera. The thing that we haven't yet seen is sustained reduction. So you get data points like you've seen the data points of oil come down. But how that translates down to the feedstocks because we don't buy crude oil is going to play itself out. So that's what we are watching. And so I don't know whether it impacts 2022 or 2023. But what we do see still right now is there's broad-based inflation all around that is getting pushed down as tiers are getting involved. And as I told you, we have updated our guidance to 750 to 850 of inflation for the year, which is higher than what we thought coming into the year. But at the same time, we are managing that inflation through price. And I think what we'll have to watch is to supply chains get sustainably improved versus one or two data points. Nicole DeBlase : Understand. You shall pass it on. Operator : Our last question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning, all and congrats on today's announcements. Mike Roman : Thanks, Brett. Brett Linzey : I appreciate the color on the separation cost, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion. But I was hoping you could provide some color, insight on what the go-forward standup corporate structure costs will be for the two entities? Monish Patolawala : Yes. Sure, Brett. So again, I'll give you benchmark data. So we have a placeholder for the healthcare business, there's a bench using standup costs that's approximately $100 million is what we said is public company cost for that size of company. Similarly, right now, what we have penciled in is for new 3M to have around 1.5% of revenue as incremental cost or stranded costs. However, as Mike and I have told you all multiple times, we are all focused on org efficiency. We are still very early in the process, and we're going to keep working this down. We got time until the spin gets done. So we're going to keep trying to be as efficient as we can and make both companies continue to grow above macro pre -- having margin expansion and strong cash. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one on the Bellevue facility. So you reached the agreement in early July on some of the actions, the new commitments. Could you just provide us with an update how that facility production is ramping? And are you still partnering with a third party there? Are you going to get back to kind of full run rate in terms of your internal sourcing strategy by the end of the year? Mike Roman : Yes. Brett, we are in the process of restarting the manufacturing operates in there. It takes some weeks to do that. We reached the agreement. We were pleased with the outcome of the cooperation that we've had with the local authorities there to resolve the matters and move ahead. So we'll be ramping up the full production here soon. So we're staying in touch with our customers, making sure everybody is aware of our time lines, but it's -- we're in the middle of that ramp up. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Best of luck. Mike Roman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : In summary, we are positioning 3M for the future to create more opportunity and greater certainty. There will be two world-class, well-capitalized public companies. We will work to efficiently and equitably resolve our Combat Arms litigation, and we will maintain our relentless focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders. We remain focused on driving growth and margin expansion and generating strong cash flow. We're excited about the new opportunities to apply 3M Science to life. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to slide three, and I will now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute our strategies to deliver for our customers, position 3M for long-term growth and manage legal matters. Our team posted organic growth of 2% or more than 3%, excluding the impact of the decline in disposable respirator sales, along with adjusted margins of 21.5%, adjusted EPS of $2.69 and $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While the global economic outlook is softening, our businesses continue to innovate for customers and capitalize on opportunities. Transportation and Electronics posted 3% organic growth, with Safety and Industrial, Consumer and Healthcare, each growing 2%. All business groups delivered margins above 21%, with notable margin expansion in Safety and Industrial, and Transportation and Electronics. Looking geographically, organic growth was led by APAC up 3%, with China up 8%, benefiting from backlog recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns in the second quarter. The Americas were up 2%, with the U.S. flat, against 6% growth in last year\u2019s Q3. Growth in EMEA was flat, as we navigate the ongoing geopolitical unrest across Europe. At the same time, we drove operational improvements to address inflation and supply chain challenges. We are delivering strong pricing, managing costs and reducing inventory backlogs, while maintaining a relentless focus on serving customers. For example, we recently invested in a new shipping consolidation center in South Carolina, which is reducing average cycle times for exports to Asia by one week to two weeks. Some of our actions have impacted near-term margins, but we will continue to do what is necessary to take care of customers. Going forward, we see a significant opportunity to reduce cost of goods sold and working capital as global supply chains improve, which includes leveraging data and data analytics to drive productivity in our plants. With respect to guidance, today we are updating full year expectations to reflect our results through nine months, along with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. For organic growth, we are lowering the high end of our range to 1.5% to 2%, against the prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%. We anticipate adjusted EPS of $10.10 to $10.35, against the previous expectation of $10.30 to $10.80. We are also updating our range for adjusted free cash flow conversion to 85% to 95% from 90% to 100% previously. To strengthen 3M for the future, we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For example, while we see near-term softness in consumer electronics, we are investing in Electronic segments that are seeing strong growth, including new solutions for automotive displays, and virtual and augmented reality. We are rolling out new thermal management solutions to improve electric car batteries, one element of our work to advance more sustainable vehicle designs. And earlier this month, we introduced a new posted app for Microsoft Teams that helps people collaborate in hybrid environments, as we execute our digital strategy and re-imagine our products. We are also innovating to make our operation safer, more efficient and more productive. At our plant in Alexandria, Minnesota, we are leveraging 3M disruptive technologies to transform our abrasive belt converting process through end-to-end automation, improving labor productivity by 32%, eliminating nine high-risk tasks and saving nearly $1 million annually. Many more similar projects are on the way across our global operations, driving safety and savings. In sustainability, we have installed a new state-of-the-art water filtration system in Cordova, Illinois. We now have all three of our largest water using sites in the U.S., utilizing industry-leading filtration technologies following through on the $1 billion sustainability commitment we made last year. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for long-term success by actively managing our portfolio, complementing all we do to strengthen our enterprise organically. Last month, we completed the divestiture of our Food Safety business, which unlocks value and further strengthens our balance sheet. We received approximately $1 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by $16 million. In addition, earlier this month, we divested two of our skin care brands in Southeast Asia, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our consumer portfolio. We have also established a dedicated team to seamlessly execute our healthcare spin-off. We are confident in our plan to create two world-class public companies with greater focus and better able to drive growth and innovation. Before turning the call to Monish, I would like to provide an update on litigation, which I know is top of mind. On Combat Arms, the Aearo Technologies Chapter 11 proceeding is active and progressing and we believe it is the best path to resolving claims in an equitable, efficient, prompt and permanent manner. That continues to be our goal, a resolution that is equitable and more certain for all parties. Aearo is participating in a confidential mediation process focused on reaching a comprehensive settlement and 3M is supporting those efforts. Aearo has also appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision in August not to extend the stay of litigation to 3M and the Seventh Circuit has agreed to hear the appeal. In the MDL, the next trial is scheduled for February of next year. We also continue to actively manage PFAS litigation. Earlier this month, we reached a settlement with the City of Gadsden, Alabama related to carpet manufacturing. The first AFFF MDL trial is now scheduled for June of 2023. In summary, we continue to deliver for customers in an uncertain environment. I thank our employees for their contributions and commitment, especially as we continue to lead through significant change and position 3M for the future. We will stay focused on driving growth, improving operational execution and delivering greater value for customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 4. Overall, the 3M team delivered third quarter sales and operating margins that were very much in line with my comments at a conference in mid-September. With some puts and takes, as consumer and consumer electronics demand declined as the quarter progressed, while industrial end markets demand remained steady. Third quarter total sales were $8.6 billion or down 3.6% year-on-year, which included headwinds of 5.1% of $450 million from foreign currency translation and 50 basis points of $50 million from the divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an organic basis, third quarter sales increased 2% versus last year. This result includes an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted organic sales by approximately $130 million or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q3 organic sales growth was 3.4%. On an adjusted basis, third quarter operating income was $1.9 billion, with operating margins of 21.5%, which were up 40 basis points year-on-year and 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.69 versus $2.58 last year. Turning to the components that impacted third quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. As you may recall, during our Investor Day this past February, we laid out our operating framework and operating principles that included daily management, data democratization, transparency and accountability. We continue to make progress in the consistency of application of this framework. By embracing these principles, along with taking self-help actions, the team executed well in the quarter as we continue to navigate the fluid and uncertain macro and geopolitical environment. We continue to focus on serving our customers and drive additional actions, including recovering our sales backlog in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns, implementing appropriate selling price actions to address ongoing inflation, maintaining strong spending discipline, implementing targeted productivity actions to adjust businesses to end market demand trends while driving simplification and continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure we are all well positioned for long-term success. These actions helped to more than offset a number of headwinds in the quarter, including the decline in disposable respirator sales, which negatively impacted Q3 operating margins by 30 basis points and earnings by $0.07 a share; incremental end market softness particularly in consumer electronics, along with oral care and consumer retail in the U.S. as persistent inflationary pressures are slowing consumer spending; ongoing global supply chain challenges and raw material constraints; and finally, geopolitical impacts, particularly Russia, which was a year-on-year headwind of $50 million to revenue and $0.03 to earnings per share. In total, our operating framework and self-help actions resulted in an overall net benefit to operating margins of 2.9 percentage points and $0.41 to earnings. Moving to raw material and logistics inflation. As I have noted over last several quarters, inflationary pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. Therefore, we continue to experience year-on-year headwind with a Q3 cost increase of approximately $225 million or a negative impact of 2.6 percentage points to operating margins and $0.31 to earnings. Our full year raw materials and logistics inflation estimate of $750 million to $850 million remains unchanged. And as we have said before, we continue to expect to offset this through pricing actions. The strength of the U.S. dollar continued to affect total revenue as foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact. As a result, we had a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, incurred a headwind of $0.12 to earnings per share. As Mike mentioned, we have been actively managing our portfolio. On September 1st, we closed the Food Safety divestiture, resulting in approximately $1 billion in consideration received, along with reducing outstanding share count by 16 million via an exchange offer. However, we lost one month of sales and income from Food Safety in the quarter. Therefore, the lost sales and income from food safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.02 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.15 per share year-on-year, driven equally by benefits from a lower share count along with a lower-than-expected tax rate. The lower third quarter adjusted tax rate was primarily the result of favorable outcomes from prior year audit settlements and geographic income mix. Looking at the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% versus 18.5% to 19.5% previously. Please turn to Slide 5. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, with conversion of 88%, an improvement from first half performance as we drive working capital intensity, including improved inventory levels, while also increasing CapEx for growth and sustainability investments. We remain focused on working capital improvement as we continue to navigate through a fluid supply chain environment. Even though the environment remains challenging, we are realizing benefits from our efforts as we leverage the use of data and data analytics to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning and optimized customer payment terms. We expect to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Capital expenditures were $435 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date are up 19% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Based upon the current status of supply chains and pace of projects, we now expect full year CapEx investments in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $850 million and share repurchases of $155 million. On a year-to-date basis, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by $16 million via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Both dividends and share repurchases remain important pillars of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to see the current value of the stock as a very attractive opportunity and have resumed share repurchase activity following the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M, because of the flexibility it provides us to continue to invest organically in the business, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return cash to shareholders while navigating legal matters. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $12.1 billion, down 3% year-on-year and down over 30% since 2019. Please turn to Slide 7 for our business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 1.7% organically compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial posted Q3 organic growth of over 6%, driven by broad-based performance along with the backlog recovery in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns. Our Personal Safety business declined low double digits organically, primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth was led by low-teen increases in both automotive aftermarket and roofing granules. Electrical markets and abrasives grew high-single digits, while closure and masking systems and industrial adhesives and tapes delivered mid single-digit growth. Operationally, the Safety and Industrial team drove strong execution during the third quarter, delivering adjusted operating income of $673 million, up 8% versus last year and up 7% sequentially versus Q2. Adjusted operating margins were 23.2%, up 2.5 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions drove yield and efficiency, and exercise strong spending discipline. The Safety and Industrial Business Group continues to focus on investing for the future, including in digital platforms such as repair stack for connected automotive body shops and sustainable platforms like thermal barriers for auto electrification. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.2 billion or up 3% organically compared to last year. Overall growth was benefited by COVID-related backlog recovery in the Greater China region, which was partially offset by increased weakness in consumer electronics demand, along with the continued constraints in the semiconductor supply chain. Our electronics-related business declined mid-single digits organically, with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets. Organic sales in our auto OEM business were up 21% year-on-year, as compared to an estimated 27% increase in car and light truck builds. As you may recall, we outperformed last year\u2019s Q3 build rate by nearly 20 percentage points as we benefit from a channel inventory build, which was unwound in Q4 last year. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial Solutions grew organically high single digits, while Advanced Materials grew mid-single digits and Transportation Safety was down low single digits. Despite the continued fluid end market environment, the Transportation and Electronics team delivered strong operating performance. Third quarter operating income increased 9% to $474 million, with operating margins of 21.2%, up 2.5 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were benefited by price actions as we navigated inflationary pressures along with the strong spending discipline. The Transportation and Electronics business group is investing to solve some of the toughest challenges in the market and executing for future growth. For example, in Q3, we opened a new battery component testing lab to support accelerating opportunities in automotive electrification. Looking at our Healthcare business, which delivered Q3 sales of $2.1 billion, with organic growth of 1.7% versus last year\u2019s strong 8% comparison. Our Medical Solutions, Food Safety, Separation and Purification, and Health Information Systems businesses all increased low-single digits organically. While we did have organic growth in Separation and Purification year-on-year, Biopharma was down in the U.S. due to last year\u2019s strong demand for COVID therapeutics. Third quarter elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as we saw activity dip in July and ramp back up as we went through the quarter. Fourth quarter procedure volumes are currently projected to be 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels as labor shortages continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was down mid-single digits against low double-digit growth from a year ago. We are also seeing softening due to the ongoing inflationary pressures impacting consumer spending on discretionary oral care and orthodontic procedures. Healthcare\u2019s third quarter operating income was $452 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.8%, down 1.7 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of over 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds. These impacts were partially offset by price actions and spending discipline. The Healthcare business group is focused on delivering innovation, including investments in the launch of 3M Filtek Matrix, which creates a new and innovative approach for dental restorations, simplifying the procedure and enabling more natural tooth structure to remain. In addition, the team made capital investments to support manufacturing capacity expansion in the Separation and Purification, and Medical Solutions business. Lastly, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.4 billion or up 1.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year\u2019s 8% comparison. Year-on-year growth in the third quarter was led by Consumer Health and Safety, which was up mid-single digits organically, and Stationery and Office and Home Care, which both grew low single digits. Home improvement growth was down low single digits organically versus last year\u2019s strong comparison, however, increased mid-teens sequentially. The back-to-school season was softer than expected as consumer spending continues to be impacted by ongoing inflationary pressures, along with retailers aggressively addressing elevated inventory levels. Looking ahead, we anticipate these impacts to continue throughout the upcoming holiday season. Consumer\u2019s third quarter operating income was $299 million, down 3% compared to last year with operating margins of 21.3%, down slightly year-on-year. Our Consumer business operating margins benefited from selling price actions, spending discipline and restructuring actions. These benefits were more than offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity headwinds. The Consumer business group is executing for future growth, including expanding our Command platform to help consumers hang, organize and decorate in even more creative ways. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. The macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. While we are working through these challenges and taking actions, we are updating our full year guidance, reflecting our year-to-date performance, increasing U.S. dollar trend along with the continued fluid environment. Our updated 2020 to full year outlook includes; organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 2% versus a prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%; adjusted earnings in the range of $10.10 to $10.35 versus a prior range of $10.30 to $10.80, which includes an additional headwind of $0.15 per share from foreign currency exchange compared to just three months ago; and adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 85% to 95% versus our prior range of 90% to 100%. Before I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the fourth quarter. First, from an end market perspective, GDP and IPI continue to moderate with current Q4 estimates of 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively. We are closely monitoring the geopolitical environment in Europe and the impact on energy inflation and end market demand. Auto build rates are currently estimated to be up 2% year-on-year, while consumer electronics demand is expected to remain soft. Healthcare elective procedure and oral care volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And lastly, we anticipate continued inflationary impacts on consumer spending, along with the inventory reduction actions at retailers. Therefore, looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total sales to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.2 billion. This includes organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, which includes a 2% headwind or $150 million to $200 million from the continued decline in disposable respirator demand, and the exit of Russia, which will create a year-on-year headwind of approximately 80 basis points or approximately $70 million. Excluding the impact from these two items, Q4 organic growth is estimated to be nearly 4% to 6%. Increasing U.S. dollar strength is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind of approximately 7% of sales or roughly $600 million. The divestiture of Food Safety and deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies will result in a Q4 headwind of approximately $120 million to sales of 1.5%. Turning to raw materials and logistics costs, we anticipate a Q4 year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million, which we expect to be able to navigate and offset the price actions. Operating margins are expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. And finally, our outstanding share count is currently anticipated to be in the mid-550 million share range, taking into account the $16 million share count reduction that I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead to 2023, while we are in the early stages of working through our plan, we see some items impacting us this year that will continue into next year, while some challenges may ease. We expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate, while geopolitical uncertainties persist, impacting energy costs and end market demand, particularly in Europe. We are also monitoring the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, along with evolving COVID-related impacts, including on government policy response, healthcare elective procedure volumes and disposable respirator demand. Looking at end markets, we expect the pace of secular industry trends to accelerate, particularly in automotive, electronics, safety, digitization and sustainability. Each of these markets have tremendous opportunities for long-term growth, as we continue to innovate and invest in these areas. Raw material, logistics and labor inflation are starting to show some signs of moderation, and we are starting to see some evidence of global supply chain stabilization. As Mike mentioned, we believe manufacturing and supply chain operations are our greatest opportunity to reduce costs and increase productivity to drive improvement in operating margin performance. While significant uncertainty is expected to remain, we are focused on serving customers and executing our operating framework and operating principles. We are prepared and will adjust as warranted, and take necessary self-help actions to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders. And finally, we are also working on ensuring we execute well on our Healthcare spin to create two leading world-class companies. As always, there is more we can do and will do. To wrap up, I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks for the third quarter. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, Mike and Monish and Bruce. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Scott. Bruce Jermeland : Good morning. Scott Davis : You guys were pretty clear about the end market outlook and stuff. Can you just take a step backwards and walk around the world, just by region on where things are getting kind of better or worse or where are things coming in a little bit better or worse than expectations. And I guess the onus of the question is that some of the results we have seen so far have been a little bit better in Europe and China than expected that you guys noted some cautious comments there. But I will just stop there and let you guys give some color? Mike Roman : Sure. Scott, maybe I will kind of walk around the regions to give you a little more color than my opening comments highlighted where we are growing in each region. Just start with the Americas, and as you look at it, we saw the strongest growth for us in automotive and areas like electrical markets and our electronics markets and materials solutions. We saw declines in Personal Safety. Monish highlighted the Separation and Purification coming off the comparison to the COVID demand in vaccines and therapeutics. And then we highlighted the softer consumer spending in oral care, both Orthodontics and chairside dentistry. Looking at EMEA, we saw it up slightly this quarter. It was slightly negative in Q2. So slightly up this quarter, strongest growth there in automotive, too. So you are seeing a trend, the strong Q3 for automotive globally. We saw declines in Personal Safety and oral care, coming off COVID for Personal Safety and some of the similar dynamics in oral care. APAC growth, again, led by automotive. Personal Safety was strong in APAC. We saw some strong strength in Industrial portfolios more broadly, something that we saw in the quarter in the Safety and Industrial business ex-Personal Safety had strong growth in the quarter -- organic growth. We saw the decline was in electronics in APAC. We also saw some impact from some of the declines in areas like Transportation Safety. And then in China, the big story was the recovery from the lockdowns in Q2 and then also the declines in display materials and broader electronics as you saw the declines in consumer electronics impacting that. We were -- we did see strength in Personal Safety. We saw strength in automotive. We saw strength in broader Industrial. So, kind of a similar story across the areas, a little different growth dynamics, but similar story. And we -- I would say, we finished the quarter with our Industrial business is showing some strength. We saw continued strength in automotive, the softening in consumer electronics. Those are some of those trends that played out across the world. And then electric procedures starting to see - seeing the same trend improving, but not back to pre-COVID levels in terms of elective procedures. So, again, trends that we are seeing across the different regions. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just to be clear, Mike, is price where you want it to be right now, are we kind of at a fairly balanced level or just cost and that\u2019s no longer a major issue? Mike Roman : Yeah. Scott, I -- we talked about that as we have gone through the year. We said at the beginning of the year that we were confident price would help us offset inflation as we came through the year and that\u2019s been the case. So our pricing, as you know, it\u2019s one component of, our value in the marketplace. The other is managing the inflation that we have been seeing globally. And we have been, I think, managing that price against inflation well all year and we are well positioned as we go into the end of the year. Scott Davis : Okay. Super helpful. Best of luck. Thank you, guys. Mike Roman : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey. Just a question sort of longer term question for you guys. How are you guys thinking about inflation into 2023? And specifically, you guys no longer disclose pricing, but just trying to understand how are you thinking about the pricing mechanism at 3M? And how are you adapting to what\u2019s happening and do you think we are going to get into a less inflationary environment or from what you are seeing inflation is pretty sticky into next year? Monish Patolawala : Andrew, it\u2019s a great question. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are still early in looking at 2023. What we are seeing is a little moderation in inflation, but it\u2019s not been consistent and persistent. We are seeing inflation is pretty much still broad-based. In areas that we are seeing is logistics has seen some slowdown in the pace of inflation. However, if you look at intermediate finished goods, they are still pretty high and so specialty raw materials. So I would say if you just look at what inflation we had in the third quarter, it was $225 million. In the fourth quarter, we are seeing somewhere between $100 million to $150 million. So there\u2019s a little moderation. I think what time will tell is whether 2023, we are able to see sustained lower prices and I think that would be good for all. So that\u2019s one. To answer your question on pricing, as Mike mentioned in his remarks and mine and even the prior question, we take a very thoughtful approach to pricing. Nearly 70% of our pricing is -- our products are pretty much spec in products. So we take a very thoughtful approach. We look at it region by region. We look at it product by product. And I would say we will have to follow. We follow a very thoughtful approach. We will follow a very thoughtful approach in 2023 also, because no one has seen this historic level of inflation in the recent past. So depending on where that goes, we will play that self out in the market. But at the end of the day, as Mike mentioned, part of our pricing is not just driven by cost, it\u2019s also the value that we drive for our customers. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. Sorry. Mike Roman : No. Go ahead. Monish Patolawala : Okay. Andrew Obin : Oh, just a follow-up question, if you look at recent stimulus that has been passed in the U.S., a lot of investment in chipset, a lot of investment on semiconductor, a lot of talk about supply chain for semiconductors, particularly things like upstream like substrate, maybe moving closer to North America. Do you guys need to sort of redo your global electronics supply chain, given what\u2019s happening out there on the regulatory front and stimulus front and just voluntary moves in capacity globally? Thanks. Mike Roman : Yeah. Andrew and we are watching it closely. The Inflation Reduction Act, The Chips Act. They are providing the incentives for manufacturers and others to make investments in other parts of the world, the U.S. -- in the U.S. versus other parts of the world. And I would say, we are assessing the impacts on our customers. You know our model, I mean, we are -- we build capabilities and sufficient resources close to customers around the world. It\u2019s a regional model and it gives us the ability to serve our customers in each region in the world that also helps us be in a position to adapt as supply chain moves and that\u2019s been true for electronics as it\u2019s moved around Asia, in particular. And with these incentives, we expect there will be some changes. We don\u2019t see a significant impact to our business in the near-term, but we do serve global customers in electronics and semiconductor and will adjust as they make changes. Andrew Obin : But nothing sort of definitive at this point yet. You are still waiting... Mike Roman : It\u2019s early in the process. There are announcements, there are investments being made and we will stay close to those and we will make adjustments as we go. And if you look at the U.S. in particular, just as a reminder, we are a net exporter out of the U.S. We export $5 billion out of the U.S. So it is a place where we have got a strong manufacturing position and that puts us in a position to adjust as capacity gets invested here. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hi, Joe. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So I saw that we kept your inflation numbers intact for the year. I am just curious, like, are you starting to see any of your costs like start to subside at all and then if you can maybe start to give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing from a manufacturing perspective and energy costs in Europe and how that\u2019s impacting your business? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So, Joe, I would tell you, we are seeing some moderation, as we saw inflation was $225 million in Q3, we are accounting for $100 million to $150 million in Q4. The total at $750 to $850 million has not changed. We are seeing -- inflation, I would say, is still generally broad-based. We are seeing higher inflation in specialty materials, as well as intermediate finished goods. We are seeing a little bit of moderation in logistics. So that\u2019s where we are on inflation. And then on supply chain, I would say, we are also seeing some signs of stabilization, Joe. We are seeing raw material flowing a little better than it has flown in the prior quarters and you can see that\u2019s why the team was also able to deliver decent productivity in Q3. We will have to watch and see whether, one, is the moderation in pricing or raw materials sustained, and secondly, is the flow of material sustained into Q4 and that\u2019s going to determine where we go. And as Mike has said, too, once we see the stabilization of supply chains and moderation of raw materials, we believe that is the best opportunity. We have other than volume to keep driving productivity in our factories and through that margin expansion. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Monish. And then I guess my follow-on question would be, obviously, a lot of uncertainty in the market right now as we are heading into 2023. Just maybe talk us through a little bit your recession playbook, how you are preparing yourself for what could be a pretty uncertain year, just any color around that would be helpful? Mike Roman : Sure, Joe. And our model -- our operating model has been strong and shown resiliency in many economic cycles. And it\u2019s been clear throughout COVID, and I would say, the concern -- the current uncertainty in the markets that we are facing and so we will continue to do what we do in those cycles that helps us react to them well and position our performance well and that\u2019s focused on serving our customers, driving productivity, efficiency in our supply chains and our factories and delivering strong cash flow and it keeps us focused on the right actions. And we will stay focused on our end markets, too, where as we have talked about, there\u2019s some different dynamics in each of the end markets, even as we look at the softening global outlook for macro. And so we are prepared to adjust and take actions. That\u2019s our model and it will serve us well as we navigate the uncertainty ahead. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So I wanted to first ask on the Q4 guide, which puts organic growth largely in line with Q3 levels at the midpoint or exactly at the midpoint despite a slightly larger respirator headwind. Could you just provide some incremental color at the -- for the puts and takes at the segment level as we look into Q4? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Sure, Chris. As -- I will just start with recapping again Q4. We will just start by saying, last year\u2019s fourth quarter was our easiest guide or easiest comparison. Number two is, you are right, so disposable respirators is going to be down and that creates a headwind of nearly 180 basis points, and then the exit of Russia is another $70 million, which gives another 80 basis points of pressure. So if you exclude all of that, you would get to a 4% to 6% increase in organic growth on a year-over-year basis. If you look at where the macro is going to be GDP and IPI is in that 2%-ish range for the fourth quarter, auto is going to be up 2% sequentially or nearly 2.5% depending on IHS forecast, approximately 2% up on a year-over-year basis. Elective procedures, which were at 90% in July and moved itself up a little bit in August and September, we believe, will move up a little bit to 90% to 95%, so you will see that uplift. I would say consumer spending continues to be weak. Even in the month of October, we have seen lower consumer spending. I called that out as those trends where the inflation is impacting the consumer, I think, remains through the holiday season, as well as how inventory levels are adjusted by retailers is something that we will have to watch. Consumer electronics continues to be down on a year-over-year basis, a little moderation on improvement on a sequential basis. But again, there, we will have to see where that plays itself out between consumer electronics, as well as then you talk about semiconductor growth continues to be strong. We are continuing to see that in our business on the other side of the electronics business. And then from an Industrial perspective, we have already talked about disposable respirator but the rest of the end market remains pretty strong in SIBG. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that. Really helpful. And then the second one just on margins, if we kind of look from Q3, margins were up versus Q2 on slightly lower topline. Is it fair to assume that reflects improving price cost or was there some margin impacts from the portfolio changes during the quarter? And if it does reflect improving price cost, I mean, is the expectation that, that should continue to improve from here even if the cost relief might be a little bit down the road? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So, Chris, I would say it\u2019s all. As we look at it and the team has been doing a great job at driving margin expansion. And in Q3, you have seen -- as you said, we continue to see the price cost equation. We have offset or managed our inflation through pricing actions. We have had better yield and efficiency also compared to the second quarter as we saw some stabilization of supply chains. Third, as I called out, we have also the team had a lot of strong spending discipline. We took a lot of self-help measures. We proactively adjusted where we saw end market change, et cetera. So put all that together, we did see 50 basis points of margin expansion. When you think about Q4, if you know that in Q3 we did $8.6 billion in Q4, we are saying $7.9 million to $8.2 million, which is the volume basically gives us the best leverage. So that\u2019s why you do see margin come down. And historically, if you look at 3M also Q3 to Q4, always shows a decline because it is a lower volume quarter for 3M. To answer your question on what happens in the long-term, I would say, Chris, the same as I have said in my prepared remarks, which is there are headwinds that we see, whether it\u2019s macroeconomic environment, FX, the impact of energy cost on, especially in Europe and the geopolitical environment are all headwinds. Similarly, we will have to watch what happens with COVID-related demand, whether it is government policy, whether it is elective procedures or whether it is our own disposable respirator demand. But there are a lot of tailwinds too. We see secular trends that will continue to go up in areas that we add a lot of value to customers, whether it\u2019s auto electrification, sustainability, digitization, just to name a few. Also, when we -- as we see raw materials starting to stabilize a moderate and supply chain starting to stabilize or moderate, we should get a lot more opportunity to drive yield and efficiency, and that\u2019s what Mike said in his prepared remarks, too, that that\u2019s -- other than volume, that\u2019s one of our biggest opportunities to continue to drive margin. So hopefully that answers your question, Chris. Chris Snyder : It does. Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Andrew. Mike Roman : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Monish, maybe just a little more color into Healthcare, I know you have talked about sales growth being a little lower in Q3, oral care turned down a little bit. It seems like the elective procedures have been stuck a little bit and you talked about them improving in Q4, but the issue just sort of staffing shortage in hospitals. What are you seeing in China over there and how concerned are you about oral care given it does tend to be a little more sensitive to the economy? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Andy, there -- you are right. There\u2019s some different dynamics going on than Q2. When you look at elective procedures and oral care versus surgical procedures or medical procedures, it kind of -- I think, in general, it\u2019s on track with what we had said at the beginning of the year that it would get back to around 95% by the end of the year, 95% to 100%, maybe we are slightly below that now. And I think that\u2019s a reflection of what was part of your question. That\u2019s the staffing levels right now. It\u2019s been a bigger impact than obviously COVID hospitalizations have been in the current quarter and then outlook for the rest of the year. So I think that\u2019s holding it back maybe keeping it from being quite at the level that we thought it would be when we started the year. Oral care, we saw strong recovery in procedures there in 2021 and that\u2019s part of the comp that we are looking at year-over-year. The impact this year appears to be consumer discretionary spending. They are electing to spend less in some of those elective procedures in oral care. So that\u2019s had a softening impact and we see those trends continue as we came out of Q3. So I -- a little bit different than maybe where we saw at the beginning of the year, but it\u2019s, generally, we are looking for improvements as we go into Q4 in those medical electric procedures. Mike Roman : I would also just add that the other piece was Biopharma, which had a very strong quarter last year, and we are seeing on a year-on-year lower demand, just driven by the COVID therapeutics that we sold into last year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful guys. And then, Monish, maybe you can update us on your work on digitization and I think you have talked in the past about data analytics really helping you in the second half of the year here and especially in 2023. It seems like today, you are talking about you having cost out opportunity. You noticed your Safety and Industrial business margin was up nicely sequentially. So how much of an impact is that coming from digitization or is this that just sort of general execution? Monish Patolawala : So I would just say the following, Andy, is, as I said in February at our Investor Day, digital can be a multiplier for 3M. And it will take time. We have four pillars. One is digital customer. The other one is digital product. The third one is digital operations. And then the last one is just digital enterprise or enterprise digital. I think the last one is ERP that helps us simplify our business. Digital operation is the place where you are talking about is from a factory perspective. The team has done a lot of work using data and data analytics to improve yield and efficiency in the factories. For example, we were able to create a digital twin for our respirator production during the pandemic, which the team is continuing to use and those models are being used for other parts of our production lines. There\u2019s a lot more we can do in this area in automation and digitization to drive yield and efficiency and especially as supply chains start normalizing. This is an area where we should be able to dig faster into root cause and put into solutions. Similarly, data and data analytics helps us in inventory a lot too, Andy. And despite all the inefficiency that exists currently in the supply chain, the teams have done a nice job of continuing to improve inventory. August to September saw a sequential decline in inventory and so that\u2019s another sign that the teams are looking at data. It allows them actually to visually see where their inventory is so it allows better demand planning. And then if you actually go to digital product and digital customer, both of them, e-commerce continues to be an important area for us of growth. In Safety and -- in the Safety and Industrial business, we bought the assets of a company called LeanTec that allows us to do software for auto body shops, so parts management through software for auto body shops. So that\u2019s starting to take hold and Mike Wale and his team have done a nice job there. And Mike Roman mentioned in his opening remarks, the collaboration we have with Microsoft, where we announced the digital posted note in collaboration with Microsoft. So you are seeing digital play itself out in multiple places. I would say there\u2019s a lot more opportunity for us in the future in this area. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Steve. Mike Roman : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Can you just give some degree of color on whether you were, like, you don\u2019t have to give details on the price, but like just with the spread positive, neutral, negative this quarter and how do you\u2026 Monish Patolawala : Positive\u2026 Stephen Tusa : \u2026 expect that in fourth quarter, it was positive this quarter? Monish Patolawala : That\u2019s right. And\u2026 Stephen Tusa : Did that accelerate -- and did that accelerate from last quarter? Monish Patolawala : To the extent where we saw more in areas where we saw more inflation, we were able to offset that with more price. So, overall, I would say, mid-single digits is where we were, Steve, on pricing. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Got it. That\u2019s great color. And then you guys kind of tweaked down the CapEx number a little bit. I know that number has been kind of growing over the last several years. Are you now kind of cresting on these major projects, and you mentioned, digitization and automation in your -- with the prior question, but how do we think about that heading into 2023, that CapEx number? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So, as I said, we are still early planning 2023. But in this case, the guide down, Steve, was just because of where we are with the length of supply chains. We have seen supply chain backlog or the cycle time of these go up anywhere from 12 weeks to 20 weeks depending on the CapEx equipment that we are buying. And so just based on where we are in the quarter, we thought it was prudent to take it down to $175 million to $185 million. But all good projects and the projects that are falling into next year will continue to get completed because they are great projects. I just wish we would have got them done this year, unfortunately, the supply chain just didn\u2019t help us. Stephen Tusa : Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Mike Roman : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. And maybe just the first question around the inventories outlook. So you took down your cash flow conversion guide for the year, even with the CapEx reduction you just discussed. I think also, Monish, you had mentioned inventory is down sort of month-on-month in September. So help us understand kind of where do you think customer inventories and distributor inventories sit right now versus normal and how much kind of destocking lies ahead for your customers and for 3M itself? How quickly should we see that cash flow conversion get back to 100%? Is it sort of late next year or you think next year as a whole, you could be there already? Mike Roman : Yeah. Julian, maybe I will just touch on how we see inventory in the channel and with our customers and it\u2019s maybe just a quick walk around the different business segments. Industrial channel inventories, they look like they are in pretty good shape. We saw, as you saw strong broad-based growth and so well aligned with that. Consumer electronics, the OEMs are working through some inventories as the demand weakens. I think automotive inventories continue to be still relatively low with the demand that they are seeing. Our Healthcare, overall, in line with the demand. We saw some softening, obviously, in oral care and the channels reacting there. So we are seeing some inventory pulled on. The big story and inventory probably is what you have heard from many other companies, the retailers working through their elevated inventory levels and navigating the kind of the shift in consumer spending and the impact there. We are seeing that as we come out of Q3. So that\u2019s kind of the external view. Maybe Monish can talk about kind of how we map it internally. Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Sure. So, Julian, it\u2019s back to the same comments we made that the global supply chain and raw material environment continues to remain fluid and dynamic. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the inventory level, even though we did take it down August through September, that\u2019s a start. One, we need to see the supply chain stabilize sustainably. And two is, when you look at where we are at the end of Q3, we don\u2019t see those inventory levels coming down to the level we would have liked in a stable environment and that\u2019s why we felt prudent to get it down to 85% to 95%. The team is continuing to work inventory using data, data analytics, get a better demand planning. At the same time, we also look at better coordination between our demand plans and our supply plans and that\u2019s what the teams are working on. And I think we will continue doing that in the long run. I would say in the long run, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t be at 100% free cash flow conversion, when you look at the cash flow that we generate and the opportunity that we have to continue to drive inventory down using data and data analytics. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then just my follow-up would be around, you mentioned earlier some self-help measures, digitization and better data tracking, just wondered in terms of kind of overall operating margins. I think 3M as a whole has been at that sort of 21%, 22% range for four years or five years now. It\u2019s been a couple of years since the last big kind of restructuring announcement in December 2020. Just wondering what the appetite was for maybe another round of that kind of big fixed cost out, particularly as the macro is a little bit softer or are you feeling pretty confident about operating leverage next year? Mike Roman : Yeah. Julian, as I talked about earlier, we are confident in our ability to respond to the changes in the macro and we are always adjusting our businesses to meet the markets and whether it\u2019s near-term or in the future. And so we are going to continue to focus on productivity. That\u2019s a big part of the self-help for us, leveraging some of the capabilities Monish talked about to drive that as supply chains improve and recover, we expect to be able to drive more self-help. And we will continue to stay close to the end markets and the macro and take actions as is needed. We don\u2019t have a big plan to announce today, but we -- our model is to adjust to markets as we go. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and thanks again\u2026 Mike Roman : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Hi, guys. So just going back to the exports, I think, you mentioned, Monish, $5 billion, if I am not mistaken. Just wondering, do you exports from the U.S. over indexed to a certain region? I think Latin America might be one, I think, maybe China as well, but any thoughts there in terms of concentrations of markets you are important to? And then in terms of the currency effects, the translation -- the transactional effect of that, are you able to kind of talk through to offset the FX impact? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. Nigel, just to break down the exports a little bit, it\u2019s net exporting, it\u2019s really based on the capabilities that we have invested in the U.S. And it does serve all of those markets, Europe, Latin America, Asia, China, and so we are -- I wouldn\u2019t say we are over-indexed anywhere. It\u2019s really a strategy of portfolio and where we produce. And while we are regionally capable for our businesses everywhere around the world, a majority of what we sell in each region of the world, we produce in region, there are some parts of our portfolio that we don\u2019t need to have capacity in order to we have the demand for every region, and so we will export out of the U.S. and that -- there is a balance around the world. You will see some over indexing in the electronics manufacturing to Asia and China, of course. But more broadly, it\u2019s balanced across the regions of the world. Nigel Coe : And the pricing, are you able to offset the currency effect? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So, Nigel, the way most of these work is they go into intermediate into the production of another factory that\u2019s locally manufacturing the product. So you will see that cost increase. The team takes all of that into account when they get their pricing, they factor in the raw material, they factor in FX and then do what they can in that area to offset it. In total, as we have talked about, currently, we see effects of the strong dollar to continue to have a headwind on 2022 earnings, negative 4.5% on revenue and it\u2019s nearly $0.50 on EPS for the year. So we do our best to try to manage it. At the end of the day, we can\u2019t eliminate such a strong dollar and we will see how it plays out in 2023. Nigel Coe : All right. I will leave it there. Thank you very much. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Mike Roman : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, Mike. I was hoping you could comment or expand your comments on what you have seen in October, especially on the consumer side, you said softer back-to-school setting up for softer holiday. I\u2019d also be interested in hearing, if you see changes in the consumer purchasing in the mix, like more focused on lower price point products and might you lose any share in this mix down? Mike Roman : Yeah. Deane, as we exited Q3, as I touched on, we saw what others are seeing. The retailers are working through elevated inventories. That was a trend we saw impacting. We saw the -- as Monish talked about a softer back-to-school, which was maybe a separate market dynamic. There\u2019s been a shift in consumer spending from what we call hard lines. So where our products are in the categories that they are in, in retail markets and that into other areas like food, for example. And so you are seeing some shifting in consumer spending. That\u2019s part of the trend that we saw coming through Q3 and we see as we come out of the quarter into the rest of the year. And I would say the inflation continues to be driving some of those trends. So that\u2019s really at a high level, that\u2019s what we are watching closely. We are close with our retail partners and watching each of the categories and consumer spending as we see those trends evolve. Deane Dray : Any share change? Mike Roman : No. We -- I think the dynamics that you are seeing in our organic growth in consumer is really about the consumer spending and the end markets. It\u2019s not about share change. We see our maintaining share and in some places gaining share. We see some of the positions that we -- where we have invested coming out of the pandemic and areas in consumer like our home improvement, even though it\u2019s -- we saw some softening demands in home improvement in the U.S. in the third quarter, we see we are well positioned to continue to have strong share in that part of the market. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies in a challenging environment, while positioning 3M for the future through investments in growth, productivity and sustainability, along with active portfolio management. We will stay focused on taking care of our customers, driving growth and improving our operational performance. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please turn to slide 3. Please note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight of financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2023. As we announced in our press release on December 20th, we'll be exiting PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, we have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include the exit of PFAS manufacturing. For 2022, we have treated the Q4 PFAS manufacturing exit cost as a special item in arriving at results adjusted for special items. However, beginning in 2023, we will expand the existing adjustment for special items to also adjust for the sales and estimate of income and associated activity of PFAS manufacturing. Therefore, our outlook for 2023 reflects this adjustment. Today's press release, press release attachments and slide presentation provide information regarding our 2022 performance on our existing Q4 2022 non-GAAP basis, along with some comparative information on the new 2023 outlook basis. We will be providing a Form 8-K during the first quarter to reflect additional effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions. With that, please turn to slide four and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders in a challenging economic environment with slowing growth, inflation and supply chain disruptions. We posted organic growth of 0.4% versus our expectation of 1% to 3%, along with adjusted margins of 19% and adjusted earnings of $2.28 per share. The slower-than-expected growth was due to rapid declines in consumer-facing markets, such as consumer electronics and retail, a dynamic that accelerated in December, as consumers sharply cut discretionary spending and retailers adjusted inventory levels. We also saw a significant slowing in China due to COVID-related disruptions, along with moderating demand across industrial markets. As demand weakened, we took actions to adjust manufacturing output and control costs, which enabled us to deliver a $250 million inventory improvement. In addition to actions taken in the second half of last year, today, we announced restructuring in our manufacturing operations, as we expect the demand trends that we saw in December to extend through the first half of 2023. I will discuss this more later in the call. With supply chain stabilizing, we are focused on improving manufacturing operations and driving working capital. These are our most significant opportunities to improve margins and cash flow. As we navigate the external environment, we continue to position 3M for the future by investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. I will recap 2022 and our outlook for 2023 after Monish takes you through the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As you will recall, we highlighted negative trends in our consumer retail and electronics-related businesses in late November. As the fourth quarter progressed, those trends accelerated. We also experienced significant slowing in China as COVID-related impacts resulted in a 17% decline in organic sales in December and down 8% for the quarter. Health Care continued to be challenged in its recovery to pre-pandemic levels, given labor shortages and hospital budgets being under pressure, while industrial end markets mostly remain steady. Fourth quarter total sales were $8.1 billion or down 6.2% year-on-year, which included headwinds from foreign currency translation of minus 5% or $400 million, which is better than the minus 7% we had expected. We also experienced a 1.6% decline from divestitures, or nearly $140 million, largely from the third quarter divestiture of food safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% versus last year. This result included an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia. These two items, combined, negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately $230 million or 2.6 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q4 organic sales growth was 3%. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income was $1.5 billion, with operating margins of 19.1%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.28 versus $2.45 last year. Turning to the components that impacted fourth quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. We took a number of actions to navigate the fluid and slowing macroeconomic environment, including managing selling prices to address inflationary pressures, reducing manufacturing output, maintaining strong spending discipline and taking additional restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end market demand. These actions delivered an underlying benefit to operating margins of 110 basis points and $0.19 to earnings. This helped more than offset headwinds from the sales decline in disposable respirators and Russia exit, which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and earnings by $0.15 per share. Inflation continues to impact raw material, logistics and energy costs. These pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. In Q4, raw material cost increased approximately $110 million or a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points to operating margins and $0.16 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of $0.10 to earnings per share, however, was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-over-year headwind of $0.04 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Please turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, with conversion of 131%, up 18 percentage points versus last year's Q4. During the quarter, we aggressively adjusted manufacturing production levels to end market trends, which drove a sequential reduction in inventory levels by $250 million. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $4.7 billion with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82%. Capital expenditures were $506 million in the quarter and $1.75 billion for the year, or up 9% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $820 million and share repurchases of $540 million. For the year, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders, including $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million shares via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M, because of the flexibility it provides. Net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $12 billion, down 4% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.4 times. Please turn to slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion or up 1.3% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $165 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial grew Q4 organic sales by 7.5%. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically, primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by low double-digit increases in electrical markets, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking systems both declined low single digits. Operationally, the Safety and Industrial team drove strong execution during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $611 million, or up 9% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.4%, up 2.7 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions, drove yield and efficiency and exercised strong spending discipline, while also investing in the business. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.1 billion, or up 1.4% organically. Our auto OEM business increased mid-teens versus a 2% increase in global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms, while also benefiting from a favorable comparison due to last year's Q4 channel inventory drawdown. Our electronics business declined 10% organically as it continued to be impacted by the significant end market weakness particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials grew organically low double digits, while both commercial solutions and transportation safety increased low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $366 million in adjusted operating income, down 3% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.8%, up 60 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team was able to more than offset manufacturing productivity headwinds and inflationary pressures with ongoing benefits from pricing, along with strong spending discipline and restructuring actions, while investing in the business. Looking at our Healthcare business, Q4 sales were $2 billion, with organic growth of 1.9% versus last year. Sales in our medical solutions business declined low single digits organically. Fourth quarter elective health care procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was up low single digits despite decreased consumer spending on discretionary items. And finally, separation and purification organic sales increased high single digits while Health Information Systems was up mid-single digits. Health Care's fourth quarter operating income was $421 million, down 18% year-on-year. Operating margins were 20.6%, down 2.9 percentage points, with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds, increased raw materials and logistics costs, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions along with the strong spending discipline. Lastly, our consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 5.7% year-on-year with particular weakness in the US, which was down high single digits. All businesses declined organically as consumers pull back on discretionary spending and retailers aggressively took actions to reduce their inventories, particularly in the US. Looking ahead, we anticipate those trends to continue at least through the first half of 2023. Consumers fourth quarter operating income was $224 million, down 24% compared to last year, with operating margins of 17.9%, down 3.3 percentage points year-on-year. This year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by increased end market weakness, higher raw materials and logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by selling price actions and strong spending discipline. I'll now turn it back over to Mike for a recap of our full year 2022 performance. Please turn to slide nine. Mike Roman : Thank you, Monish. 2022 was a pivotal year for 3M. Throughout the year, we took decisive actions that are foundational to our future and at the same time, maintained our focus on our customers. We addressed inflation through selling price actions and proactively managed cost as demand softened throughout the year. To address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times, including opening a new distribution center on the East Coast. We navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China. We reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht and exited our Russia business. As always, we put 3M science to work to solve customer needs across our market-leading businesses. In Safety and Industrial, our new robotic paint repair system received multiple prestigious honors, as we continue to drive innovation in automotive manufacturing, an area we led in for more than 100 years. In Consumer, we launched Scotch cushion lock, a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap, which was recognized by Fast Company as one of its world-changing ideas. In Health Care, we advanced our leadership in wound care, which includes our negative pressure wound therapies, becoming the first solution of its kind to surpass 2,000 peer-reviewed studies. In Transportation and Electronics, we introduced new thermal barrier films to improve performance of electric car batteries, one element of our $0.5 billion automotive electrification platform, which delivered 30% organic growth in 2022. Company-wide, for the total year, we delivered organic growth of 1%, or 3% excluding the impact of disposable respirators and our Russia exit. We posted adjusted EPS of $10.10, along with adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion with an adjusted conversion rate of 82%. We strengthened our balance sheet and reduced net debt by $0.5 billion, ending 2022 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4. This enabled us to invest in the business and returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, we took actions to position us for the long-term. We divested our Food Safety business, receiving $1 billion and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continue to progress in our health care spin-off, which will create two world-class public companies better positioned to drive growth and value creation. With respect to combat arms litigation, as last week's report from the Chapter 11 co-mediators indicated, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies in this ongoing confidential mediation process. We continue to address PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also announced we will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Our decision is based on careful consideration of the external landscape, including regulatory trends and changing stakeholder expectations. We simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers. We followed through on our sustainability commitments. We are ahead of schedule installing state-of-the-art filtration technologies and factories around the world. We now have capabilities up and running at all three of our largest water using sites in the US and in centric [ph]. We supported employee health, safety and well-being, including new flexible work arrangements and factory investments and we advanced diversity, equity and inclusion, with each of our business groups now executing initiatives. The steps we took in 2022 and the steps we are continuing to take in 2023, position us well as we look toward the future. Please turn to Slide 11. We expect market and macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023. Based on this outlook, we expect organic growth of minus 3% to flat, along with adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $9, and adjusted free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. Our expectations reflect the slowing in demand we are seeing as we start 2023. Supply chains are improving. However, we still see headwinds from material availability and inflation, albeit at a lower level. We are not satisfied with our progress or performance. We are taking additional actions, building on the actions taken in the second half of 2022 to reduce cost structure and inventory. We have implemented strict control of hiring and discretionary spending. Today, we announced that we will reduce approximately 2,500 global manufacturing roles, a necessary decision to further align with adjusted production volumes. In addition to the actions we are taking to respond to the macroeconomic environment, we are taking a deeper look at everything we do as we prepare for the Health Care spend. As we move through the year, we will take additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us even closer to our customers. At the same time, we win in the market because we stay close to customers and continue to invest in innovation even in the most difficult times. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities in our businesses, aligned to global trends that take best advantage of our innovation. Automotive electrification, industrial automation, biopharma processing and home improvement are just a few examples of large, fast-growing markets where we are investing and where 3M innovation can make a difference. We will continue to prepare for the spin-off of our Health Care business, which presents a tremendous value creation opportunity while at the same time, preparing 3M for future success. We will work to resolve litigation we face following through on the actions we initiated in 2022. Underpinning all of our work will be the strengths of 3M, our people, our industry-leading innovation, our advanced manufacturing, our global capabilities and our iconic brands. I am confident in our future as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M. Monish will now cover the details of our outlook. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike. Please turn to slide 12. The macroeconomic environment remains very fluid and uncertain. For 2023, we anticipate that GDP and IPI will continue to moderate with both currently estimated to be around 1.5% or about half of 2022 levels. Therefore, against this backdrop, we feel it prudent to set our expectations to reflect this reality. As Mike mentioned, we estimate our full year adjusted organic sales growth to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This includes selling prices up low single digits. Therefore, organic volumes are expected to be down low to mid-single digits for the year. This range also includes an estimated two percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. We currently expect our disposable respirator demand to be down to pre-pandemic levels. As the strength of the US dollar carries into 2023, we estimate a foreign currency translation impact to sales of minus 1% to minus 2%. And divestitures that were completed in 2022 will be a headwind to sales of nearly one percentage point. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. This range includes a combined earnings headwind of $0.55 to $0.80 per share year-on-year from the following three items. First, the expected sales decline of disposable respirators and exit of Russia will be an impact of minus $0.30 to minus $0.45. Second, foreign currency will be a headwind of minus $0.10 to $0.20; and third, divestiture impacts would be a minus $0.15. In addition, the 2022 carryover impact of higher raw material and logistics costs, combined with energy inflation, creates a year-on-year headwind of approximately $150 million to $250 million or roughly $0.20 to $0.35 to EPS. And finally, non-operating items are estimated to be an impact to earnings per share of flat to minus $0.10. This range includes a year-on-year increase in non-operating pension expense of $125 million. A full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 18% to 19% and a lower year-on-year outstanding share count. While there are a number of headwinds to earnings in 2023, ultimately, our full year performance will be driven by organic sales volumes, sustained progress in global supply chains and raw material availability, and our ability to drive improvements and reduce costs in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Finally, full year adjusted free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of 90% to 100%. This range includes the continued healing of global supply chain, expected improvements in working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions and full year capital expenditures of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing. Please turn to slide 13. Looking at our expected performance by business. We see Safety and Industrial organic sales growth to be down low single digits in 2023. This includes an estimated decline in disposable respirator sales of $450 million to $550 million or a negative impact of approximately four percentage points as the business returns to pre-pandemic levels. Demand across industrial end markets is moderating as customers remain cautious. Our Safety and Industrial team will also be monitoring the recovery of industrial production activity in China as we start the year. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics, excluding the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing is forecasted to be down mid-single digits to flat organically. Looking across end markets, automotive unit volume production is currently forecasted to be up nearly 4% year-on-year. We also expect automotive electrification trends to remain strong as we leverage our technologies and develop new innovative solutions for our automotive OEM customers. Electronics, however, is expected to be down significantly due to weak end market demand for TVs, tablets and smartphones, along with the ongoing impact of display technology shifting to OLED from LCD. Healthcare's organic sales growth is anticipated to be up low to mid-single digits versus 2022. We expect gradual improvement in healthcare elective procedure volume as nurse labor shortages and strain hospital budgets continue to impact global healthcare systems. In oral care, we will be monitoring consumer discretionary spending and its impact on patient visits, including orthodontic care. The Healthcare team continues to create differentiated value and deliver strong margins for the attractive end markets we serve. And finally, organic sales in consumer are estimated to be down low single digits to flat as US consumers remain cautious and retailers continue to aggressively reduce the excess inventory levels. Despite these near-term challenges, the consumer team remains focused on leveraging our iconic brands and accelerating new products in 2023. Please turn to slide 14. Before we go to Q&A, I want to walk through how we are seeing the first quarter. First, three weeks into January, we are seeing continued slowing in organic sales volume as we start the year. This slow start is driven by the same weakening end market trends that impacted the finish to 2022. We expect soft consumer discretionary spending, along with retailer destocking to continue into the first quarter. Sales of electronic devices are forecasted to be down between 10% and 30% sequentially in the first quarter, while semiconductor end markets and automotive builds are down mid-single digits sequentially. Health care and oral care elective procedure volumes are expected to be at the same levels as Q4. And as we have noted, industrial end markets are mixed. And we anticipate the ongoing COVID-related challenges to continue in China and the geopolitical situation in EMEA to persist. Therefore, taking all of these items into consideration, we estimate Q1 total adjusted sales in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion versus $8.5 billion adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing or down 10% to 15% year-on-year. This anticipated year-on-year decline includes headwinds of 3 to 4 percentage points from disposable respirator sales declines and Russia exit, 3 to 4 percentage points from foreign currency translation, and 1 percentage point impact from divestitures. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q1 organic sales to be down low single digits to mid-single digits. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that first quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.65. This range is impacted by the continued slowing of organic sales volumes, a pre-tax restructuring charge of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share, a tax rate of approximately 19%, along with normal Q1 items. As you can see, the first quarter presents a tough start to the year. We will have our most challenging year-on-year comps related to the declining disposable respirator demand and our exit of Russia. Ultimately, organic volume trends will be the biggest factor in determining how the quarter will turn out. 2023 is an important year as we work on progressing our strategies, including preparing for the spin off health care, improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and taking actions to further streamline the organization. We are focused on creating the shortest path to the customer and providing innovative solutions to their most challenging problems. We will remain nimble and take appropriate actions as we respond to changing market dynamics. And we will continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure the long-term success of our enterprise. To wrap up, I continue to be bullish on our long-term trends. The large and attractive end markets we serve provide exciting opportunities for the future of 3M. We are not satisfied with our performance and the expected start this year. We are working to aggressively address our operating performance in this challenging environment. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronic markets stabilize. China works through its COVID-related challenges and as our year-on-year comps ease. We also expect supply chains to continue to heal and raw materials and logistic cost headwinds to abate. Therefore, we anticipate improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow as we progress through the year. As you've heard me say before, there is always more we can do and we will do to improve our performance. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning everybody. Mike Roman : Good morning Scott. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I was hoping you could walk us through, just perhaps logistically or opportunistically, how you exit PFAS. It's so integrated with your with your product line, your manufacturing systems. Can you sell some facilities? Can you extract some value, or is it -- or do you just have to close -- lock up the facility and walk away? And how does that work logistically? Mike Roman : Yeah, Scott. So maybe I'll take you back to the announcement of the exit. We said we'll exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We also said we would work to discontinue use of PFAS in our products broadly across the company. That's both in our products, but also in the manufacturing of our products. And I think your question is really on our manufacturing part of that. And we said we will meet contractual commitments that we have to our customers, and we're working closely with them to manage that as we make this transition. But ultimately, also, I talked about that we are not planning and won't sell the businesses and that we will plan to shut them down as we work through the transition as we get to the end of that -- end of 2025. Monish Patolawala : Scott, just also a reminder, as we disclosed, we said we would take -- the exit cost of this will be in the range $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. And we took a fourth quarter charge of $800 million, that's included in that range of $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked about doing some further restructuring, perhaps help us understand the scope or scale, or at least are you talking about -- I think you mentioned 2,500 people. But are the rooftops and meaningful cost out that you see in this plan? Mike Roman : Yeah, Scott. So the announcement we made today was 2,500 jobs in manufacturing, really is responding to the volume that we see, the outlook for the volume. And that's -- we're putting a focus on supply chain. We see an opportunity to continue to streamline our supply chain. We hope to take advantage of some of the tailwinds or supply chain\u2019s heel, as Monish talked about. We're taking actions ourselves, and we're looking at what additional actions we can take there. And we're looking deeper in the company as well as we work to prepare for the healthcare spend, we've been looking at 3M ParentCo as well. And how do we simplify, streamline and put our position ourselves closer to customers. So it's really looking deeper and broader. And I think taking actions, proactively taking actions against the outlook we have for our markets. Scott Davis : All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on guys. Appreciate it. Mike Roman : Yeah. See you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Hey, Andy. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Monish, you mentioned that industrial end markets are moderating, customers are cautious. I think for instance, you mentioned industrial adhesives and tapes down in Q4. Has there been a material change from conversations that you've had previously with industrial customers, or is this just gradual moderation? And then is the regional weakness that you're seeing in China just a function of COVID interruption and more consumer base versus end demand related? And how do you think that pans out in 2023? Mike Roman : Yeah. Andy, back to Monish's comments, we're seeing kind of mixed performance in the industrial markets. We see strengths as we said, as we came through the quarter in areas like electrical markets and automotive aftermarket. We were seeing some moderation in specific end market segments. And the comment about industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking is some of that is related to the electronics slowdown. So that's part of that impact. It's also impacted by China. So China has really got a couple of things that are part of the slowdown. One of them is COVID and the interruption in the markets in industrial production and GDP. It's also reflecting the importance of electronics to that market into our business there in China. And we see that continuing those dynamics that we saw in Q4 continuing into the start of the New Year. We saw some moderation in specific segments of industrial. We saw specialty vehicle construction markets. We saw some moderation coming through the end of the quarter. We're off to a slow start as we start the year. There's a couple of areas of destocking really related to those end market segments where we've seen nothing more broad-based than that. We had strong performance across some of those other end markets in industrial. But \u2013 we're starting to see some moderating and, like I said, January is off to a slower start for industrial. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful. And then maybe could you give us a little more color regarding price versus cost expectations for 2023. You mentioned the low single-digit price improvement you're seeing. You also mentioned supply chains are healing. Are you generally seeing pricing hold up for you despite some of this demand weakness across the portfolio? And then versus raw material and energy related headwinds, does that price versus cost equationgetting increasingly green as you go throughout the year? Monish Patolawala : Yeah. So I think two different points in there, Andy. As you correctly pointed out, the carryover impact on what we have assumed right now in the guide is two pieces on the selling price. We said approximately 2% -- at the same time, the carryover impact of both raw materials and energy inflation is approximately $150 million to $250 million. So when you just do that equation together, right now, it's positive. I think what we'll see as we go through is how do supply chains heal and how fast can we get the cost out. But at the same time, it will take a little bit of time as we sell through our higher cost goods to our inventory, you're going to see some of that moderate, but it will start showing up as the year progresses. The key question for us that we have to think through and that's what we are thinking through is, as deflation starts showing up in the economy, the discussion that's going to come up is the elasticity of price across not just our company but across all companies. And what we have found over time, Andy, as you know, 3M so well that our innovation ultimately drives the value that we add for our customers. And historically, we have been able to have a good price cost equation, because of the value that we add for customers. So, seeing what we'll see in 2023 will depend on supply chains and what plays out in the long run, we are very confident that the price/cost equation continues to be green just because of the value we add to our customers. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, Monish. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Mike Roman : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just few questions. What are you guys just -- and if I missed it, I apologize, but are you sort of modeling an explicit recession in your forecast? What are your macroeconomic assumptions? I know you sort of said things are slowing, but are you explicitly modeling a recession? Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew, underlying our view of the year is -- the projection for the macro is part of it. And then we're talking about specific markets and dynamics that we're seeing coming through the quarter into -- coming through the fourth quarter into the New Year. So when you look at the macro global GDP, IPI in the 1.5% kind of range is the outlook for the year, you can see US softer than that, you see GDP below 1%, you see IPI even projected to turn negative as we get into the middle of the year. So those are kind of the macro dynamics that we're looking at. We're also looking closely as we talked about in a couple of these market segments. Fourth quarter, you saw this 10% to 30% decline in the consumer electronics build and that is expected and projected I would say, to continue as we get into first quarter and the first half of the year and consumer discretionary spending and the impact on the -- our end markets is -- that was in decline in Q4, I expect that to continue. So the macro is part of it, and we're looking closely at these key market segments and the indicators there. And I think it really says Q1 looks like Q4 and there are some areas of additional slowing. And then we kind of look at the total macro for the rest of the year as we shape up our outlook. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then the question about pricing. Just historically, given -- and I know the way you report pricing is not necessarily how we think about pricing internally. I completely appreciate that. But has anything changed in the market structure in terms of your ability to drive the pricing. I just would have thought for 3M reported pricing would have been more of a tailwind into 2023. But it is what it is, but are there any structural changes that you're seeing and that you're trying to address? Thank you. Mike Roman : Andy, there really is two parts to our pricing actions in the near term. One of them is what Monish talked about, we are always really looking closely at our price value in the marketplace. Our innovation delivers value to our customers. We manage our pricing in the -- take advantage of that value and really make sure that we are getting that value through our broader market pricing. The last couple of years has brought in the inflation dynamic, and that's really been the driver. We are taking pricing actions to adjust for the input cost. And so you've got a mix of our innovation as well as the inflation dynamic. And so as you look into 2023, you're -- we're confident we'll continue to position ourselves in strong price value based on our innovation we are going to be managing inflation along with everyone else, how do we see that progressing, and what will we do with our prices, adjusting those if we see additional inflation and managing those as the -- I would say the elasticity in the market around inflation plays itself out. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Hey, Steve. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : What are you guys seeing on the inventory side of the -- of your more industrial businesses? I think you talked a bit about auto, but maybe just on the general industrial side, customer inventory behavior? Mike Roman : Yes. Steve, I touched on a little bit of that. I would say as we began Q4, overall inventory looked to be in pretty good shape. And that was with the notable exception of Consumer. Everyone was working to reduce the inventory, and we saw a lot of destocking efforts in consumer. As I said, we're starting to see some destocking in industrial. I would say, Asia and China, where we are seeing weaknesses in consumer electronics driving some of that. And as I mentioned earlier, some specialty markets like construction and a few other areas like even packaging, we're seeing some reduction of inventory as we start the New Year. When you look at our transportation and electronics business, the consumer electronics OEMs are reducing inventories. With that outlook for their demand, they're reacting to it. Automotive OEM inventory still remains low. It's improving, but it remains low as they're recovering from some of the supply chain disruptions. Health care, overall, looks pretty stable. We see oral care channel reacting to some of the consumer discretionary spending and slowing there in oral care that we saw really in the second half. And then it comes back, the biggest move is in the consumer where our retailers are still aggressively reducing inventory. So some dynamics reflecting some of the changes in demand in the end markets. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then you mentioned January was starting slow. I mean, can you give us a little bit of context? Is that -- is January an organic kind of like below the low end of the annual range? Just roughly, just some color on kind of how slow January started for you guys? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Steve. So back to January, yes, it is lower than the overall range. And partly, that's also driven by the toughest comps that we're going to have going into 1Q. As I mentioned, 7.2% to 7.6% -- $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion is the revenue range. It will be down 10% to 15% versus last year's adjusted. And you have to take revenue and adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing, which would be around $8.5 billion. But embedded in that is 3% to 4% from foreign currency headwinds. So it's a Q4 carryover impact. You've got 1% from divestitures, which is based on the closure of the Food Safety and some of the other transactions we did in 3Q. And then you've got a very large headwind from DR and Russia. If you recall last year, we had a very strong 1Q with the Omicron variant. Plus at that time, we had not announced the exit of Russia until mid-March. So that's another 300 to 400 basis points of pressure because you've got a comp. And therefore, overall, it's LSD to MSD is what we think right now is organic sales growth for 1Q. And what you'll find is as the year goes on, these comps start getting easier and that will start showing the growth on a year-over-year basis. Hopefully that answers your question? Stephen Tusa : Yes. You weren't down double-digit in January. Are you? Double-digit? Monish Patolawala : As of right now, we are somewhere in that range of where I told you. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks and good morning everybody. Mike Roman : Morning Joe. Monish Patolawala : Morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : I know we've talked a lot about the organic growth guidance for the year. I guess I'm just curious, when you think about the consumer specifically, it seems like you're embedding improvement as the year goes along. Is that just a function of inventories getting better? How much of that is China reopening? I just want to get an understanding of that business specifically. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, on Consumer -- so you're right, Joe, I'll start with the summary, which is we are expecting that as things stabilize and as customers slow down their destocking, you will start seeing the comps get better in the year. The fourth quarter was extremely hard. And as Mike said, we saw an acceleration of a trend in December. We continue to see that in January, and that's why the first quarter starts pretty soft. But our hope is that as things stabilize, as destocking gets better, as consumer confidence builds into the year, we'll start seeing the consumer business starting to get better. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Monish. And maybe my follow-up question is a little bit of a longer term question on the electronics business. So, specifically, I think in your comments, as you mentioned that the shift into OLED. I know there was an announcement about Apple making your own custom displays starting in 2024. Just trying to understand like how that will potentially impact your business beyond this year? And then is it already expected to impact your business in 2023? Monish Patolawala : What -- I would answer and then I'll ask Mike to join in. The way I look at this, Joe, is there are a couple of things. The company has always -- has been looking at the LCD-OLED transition for a period of time. And that transition has been happening for a few years and the team has continued to deal with that as it goes on. What the team is working through is as new devices are coming on, what does that mean from a OLED to LCD ratio to mix. It definitely did have an impact for us in 2022. And then we are seeing what trends we are seeing -- as of right now, the trends we saw, we have predicted into 2023. But with that said, the one thing about the Electronics segment and especially the display teams is they always have a lot of innovation that is out there that helps offset some of these headwinds that come across. That business keeps reinventing itself as time has gone. For example, Ashish and his team have launched products that are used in AR and VR technology, which also hopefully is a growth market in the future, and that's what -- that business is very good at looking at these trends, working these headwinds, and then finding innovation to offset that as time goes. But right now, we have embedded what we think is the trend in LCD-OLED shift into our 2023 guide. Mike Roman : Yes. And Joe, I would add we've been managing that transition and that trend for some time. It's -- and it's part of our innovation that we're doing with our customers, too, innovating on both sides of that, the OLED displays. And as Monish said, the other higher growth segments in electronics, historically, our electronics business has been overweight to consumer electronics. And as we've talked about over the last few years, our strategy is continue to innovate there, and we're working with our customers multiple generations ahead, whether it's OLED displays or other applications, we're really working with them to innovate and drive value and opportunity for 3M in that consumer electronics. At the same time, we recognize the big growth drivers are some of these other higher growth segments. And Monish talked about AR, VR now emerging as one of those opportunities. Automotive electrification, of course, is the largest of those right now. There's other areas like factory automation, and even into electronic, into semiconductor manufacturing kinds of processes. So we are innovating in those spaces and at the same time, looking ahead and managing through the next display technologies and the next mobile device technologies and consumer electronics. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start on the operating margins. So, sort of, backing into what you've talked about, are we right in assuming that the guide embeds sort of 19% operating margin for the year and sort of mid-teens in Q1? And then, on that Q1 aspect, very heavy decremental margins sequentially, even without the restructuring charge. Is there a lot of sort of under production going on at 3M to clear out inventory, for example? Just trying to understand why that Q1 margin is so light. I think, it's like a 50% decremental or something excluding the restructuring. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So as I've always said, Julian, first is, volume gives us the best leverage. And what you have seen in Q4 continues into Q1. As we have said in Q4, we took some aggressive actions on making sure we rightsized our manufacturing facilities to help control inventory. Our plan is we will continue to aggressively manage production as a way to -- manage production as a way to manage cash at the same time. So we're not building unnecessary inventory. So that's number one. I think number two is, as I mentioned, there's continued pressure on a year-over-year basis on foreign currency between 3% to 4%. If you look at it versus fourth quarter exit rate, it's pretty much, I would say, flat to what fourth quarter exit rate was. And then the other item, you mentioned the restructuring, but we also have other normal 1Q items that we have from an accounting basis that we take, which is normal in every quarter. And that's why the start to 1Q is slower. But as you accelerate or move through the year, volume and the supply chain healing are the two factors that will continue to drive us to get these margins better. And if we're looking at it on a year-over-year basis, it's all driven by the comps that we had last year, which impact us heavily. So its lower volume in Q1, that's a big driver and volume will be the big determinant on what we think Q1 is going to be. Julian Mitchell : And, Monish, is that roughly right on that sort of mid-teens operating margin Q1 and 19-ish for the year in your guide? Monish Patolawala : Yes. Yes, it's actually close there. It's close enough, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Okay. Thanks a lot. And then one quick follow-up on that for Mike. Mike, you've announced a restructuring program today. I think it's the first kind of formal discrete one since fourth quarter of 2020. And you had the business transformation savings program prior to that. Just wondered, sort of, when you think about the scope of the current restructuring plan, what kind of savings run rate we should expect annually when do you get to that? And how do you assess the scope of this being enough to get margins back on track as you had those prior restructuring programs, but margins have stayed under pressure? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yeah, Julian, the way we're thinking about it. And like I said, this is certainly taking on what we see in the markets and in our performance and the supply chain dynamics that we're facing, all of that's part of what we're focused on as we look at these actions as we go through the year, adding to what we've already announced. And then we are thinking and getting ready for the spin off healthcare. We're taking a deeper look, as I said, at everything we do. There's opportunities to streamline what we do as a company in the face of those end market dynamics and our operations. And we're learning from the changes that we've made to this point. So we'll continue to work on that. In terms of giving you a view of the impact of that, that's something we'll come back with as we make decisions and announce those actions, those additional actions as we go through there. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for all the 2023 planning assumption details. Mike Roman : Morning, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : And also for providing first quarter guidance, I know that's not a typical practice but given all the moving parts, we appreciate that. So my question relates -- it's come up a couple of times on the healthcare spin. Can you remind us the timing that you're expecting? There was some noise about the potential challenges in the courts. Where does that stand? And on the separation costs, how much is this impacting 2023, or is that all excluded and stranded costs? How quickly would you be able to address those? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yeah, Deane, maybe I'll talk a little bit about just the spin. Monish, can talk about the separation cost model. We have a dedicated team working and building the execution plans. We're making very good progress. We talked about our expectation that we would be completing the spin by the end of 2023, early 2024 and that's the focus for the teams as they work to execute this. You commented on there had been some -- actually, there was a suit in the marketplace around the spin of healthcare and would we be able to complete that. And that was something that was dismissed. And so there's nothing from that dynamic that's impacting us. It's really about our teams working to execute the spin. And as I said, they're making very good progress. We're confident that we're moving in the right direction and moving ahead at pace. Monish Patolawala : So as regards to the guide, Deane, as we had disclosed when we announced the spin off healthcare, we currently do not be -- we are thinking of counting it as a special item, so that will be excluded from our ongoing operations. We are unable to predict how much of that will show up in 2023, so we haven't put that in our guide. But when we announced the transaction, we had given you a framework that our transaction cost of spin-off will be somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, which is a mixture of CapEx and OpEx. The teams are continuing to work that as they go through right now. We've now been at this for the last four to five months. So as we get better estimates around that, we will definitely keep you posted. And then as regards stranded cost, as Mike mentioned, and we had also mentioned it in the last quarter, this is an opportunity for us to look at everything that we do as we are getting ready for the spin. And our goal is to reduce stranded costs as much as we can, and we'll keep working it as we go through it. And we'll definitely let you all know as we figure this out. But the teams are actively working. The teams are staffed and they're doing an amazing job keeping the program on track. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've covered a lot of ground here. But I want to go back to 1Q 2023, perhaps Monish. We calculate a 15% margin, which is kind of similar to Julian's mid-teens. I don't think we've ever seen a margin that low. I think the GFC, we saw 17% and change margin. So just wondering why margins will be so low. And I understand supply chain is a factor here, but why 15%? What's going on? And as part of this sort of question, the kind of the coverage of the full year plan even at the low end of the range is still really, really low. So I think it's about 17% to 19% coverage, making a very big back-end loaded year. So I know you said volume gets better, but what gives you confidence and what can give investors confidence enough capture in the back half of the year? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I think two different questions and both great ones. So I'll try to answer the first one, similar to what I told Julian. Volume gives us the best leverage. And when you just look at it even sequentially and you adjust for FX, which helped us versus a guide that we had given volumes are going to be flat. We have started very low in the month of January, and that puts tremendous pressure on our fixed cost, number one. Number two, we have a restructuring charge. And then number three, our tax rate is 19%. And then, of course, we have another normal 1Q items from an accounting basis that we take. So when you put all that together, I would say, Nigel, it comes down to volume. Volume is down 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis. And so that's number one. This is the toughest comp and you have DR and the exit of Russia, both of which we have disclosed in the past. When you apply them at company margin, which is at 46%, that puts pressure also on a year-over-year basis. When I go through the remaining quarter year and as you correctly asked the question, what happens on margins, as you start thinking about we exit some of these comps that are difficult, 1Q being the toughest, volumes will start, our comps will start getting better. The supply chain efficiencies, the actions that we have announced also in 1Q and some of the actions we took in 4Q will all start showing up in the remaining of the year. Again, as I mentioned, some of these items, including cost out from raw materials take a little bit of time as we work through our higher cost of inventory through the system. If you also look at external data, and that's what we can look at because none of us are able to predict what we can in the future, external data says the second half gets better. It gets better in China, it gets better globally. And that's another reason why we are hopeful that as volumes come back in the second half, we should see our own margins go up and our own revenue go up. But with that said, at the end of the day, we control -- we don't control the markets, but what we definitely control is our own actions. And so continuing to drive supply chain efficiency, continuing to make sure that we are being as nimble and agile as we can. Using Mike's words, we are looking at everything. We're being very careful and discretionary in hiring. And 2023 is an important year for year. It's a year that we plan to execute on a lot of our strategies over the last few years, including the spin of our health care and improving our supply chain operations. I just want to end with your question, we are not satisfied with where we are. We're going to continue to look at this. We're going to continue to be nimble and agile as the volume plays itself out. And our goal is to keep building from where we are right now. Bruce Jermeland : Hey, Nigel, I just want to correct one thing Monish said. Our total sales for Q1 are going to be down 10% to 15%, not volume. Monish Patolawala : I'm sorry. Yeah. Bruce Jermeland : Organic sales growth is forecast to be down low single digits to mid-single digits. Nigel Coe : Okay. I was going to follow-up on that. Thanks for that clarification. Bruce. And I know, I've asked a few questions there, but I do have one for Mike. You said, everything on the table in terms of your reorganization and things about new ways of doing things, five or six years ago, 3M went through a sort of pretty big centralization of supply chain and business support functions. In hindsight, has that left the organization a bit too rigid? Was that the right move? And could you unwind that stabilization? Mike Roman : Yeah, I would say that, Nigel that, the change is that \u2013 there's a couple of different changes that we made to the supply chain maybe that you're thinking about. One was we did take actions on some of the structure and really looking at factories, our footprint of factories a number of years ago. And then we moved to \u2013 when we announced the change to our business group led model, we went to a common supply chain model globally. And we made some additional steps in that in last year, really to continue to drive more flexibility, greater streamlined performance end-to-end in our supply chain. So, we see it really more as an opportunity to build on the changes we have made and drive simplification, streamline, more productivity, reducing our costs, delivering more directly to customers. So it's continuing to build on some of those changes. I think those actually have positioned us to be more flexible as we go ahead. And there's an expectation that supply chains will continue to heal. So we want to be able to take advantage of those of those tailwinds that we hope to see as we go through the year. At the same time, we control what we control, and that is making additional changes based on what we've learned to, to really execute our performance in our supply chain. It's the biggest opportunity we have to improve margin and cash flow as we go through the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Dan Rizzo : Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thanks. Thanks for fitting me in. I don't know, if I missed this or not, but you mentioned that free cash flow conversion is 90% to 100% this year. Is that long-term goal? Can you maintain that? I mean, as things kind of, I guess, will get less volatile in the out years? Monish Patolawala : Yeah, it's 90% to 100% for 2023, just to be clear, that was the guide. Dan Rizzo : Right. Monish Patolawala : For last year, we ended at 82%. As I've said multiple times, the opportunity for 3M's cash from a working capital comes from inventory management and EP. And to answer your question, is it sustainable, of course, it will ultimately depend on the income that we generated depends on how supply chains behave and the capital. But if you just look at the ability for us to use data and data analytics to help drive inventory and working capital clearly exists. In the fourth quarter, the teams did an amazing job to take inventories down, got it down by nearly $250 million. And as supply chains start to heal, this is clearly an opportunity for us, and we're going to keep driving that. Dan Rizzo : All right. Thank you very much. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : We have no further phone questions at this time. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we are focused on creating value for customers and shareholders in a challenging environment. We will continue to take actions to improve our performance, control costs and drive simplification while building 3M for the future. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I recap our first quarter, I want to discuss actions we are taking to improve our performance. As you recall, over the past few years, we have implemented a new global operating model led by our four business groups, which included moving to a common global supply chain design end-to-end. We have since advanced our digital capabilities, further repositioned our portfolio and continue to invest in growth and productivity. Our experience throughout this journey, including lessons learned during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and changing global trends has shown us what is working and what we can do better. As I said last quarter, we are looking at everything we do. Today, we are announcing additional actions to improve our cost structure, streamline our corporate center, strengthen our supply chain, enhance our go-to-market models and drive greater focus in markets, where 3M science gives us a clear competitive advantage. We will reduce costs at the corporate center by eliminating management layers across the company. We are broadly reducing our corporate shared services like our central design group. We are reducing rooftops worldwide, including exiting our conference center in Northern Minnesota. We are also simplifying and modernizing our technology by moving to the cloud and removing hundreds of legacy systems. This reduces costs and provides us greater agility and flexibility to invest in differentiated digital areas like data, analytics and automation while increasing investments in cybersecurity. We are simplifying our supply chain structure to better align with our businesses and improve performance in every aspect of plan, source, make and deliver while adding industry expertise to help drive our progress. The actions we are announcing today will help us complete our shift from area to global management, simplifying reporting lines and clarifying accountability. We are also taking out layers of management and duplication of activities across all areas of supply chain. Our progress in digital gives us better tools to use in the areas of planning, sourcing and logistics, removing redundant work and improving productivity. And we will prioritize our continuous improvement efforts in our largest factory operations. We will have a more efficient support structure and operating model to improve service, cost and inventory. We are streamlining go-to-market models to better align with customers, improve agility and reduce management structure. This is driven by our relentless focus on optimizing the path to our customer. We are not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. We are customizing an approach for each business that ensures greater focus. In Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics, we will eliminate certain area-based business group leadership and move to a division-led model. In Transportation and Electronics, we will also combine two divisions, further reducing structure. In Consumer, we will simplify how we go-to-market, with each area team aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and leading brands. In addition, we are changing our go-to-market model in approximately 30 countries around the globe, which represent less than 5% of our revenue. In these countries, we will leverage our digital and export capabilities and move to a model partnering with distributors with deep local knowledge and infrastructure, enabling us to significantly reduce our people, real estate and other related costs. Through our actions, we plan to eliminate approximately 6,000 positions globally in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles we announced in January. In total, this represents about 10% of our global workforce and senior executive roles. Reductions will span all functions, businesses and geographies and be completed in accordance with local regulations. We expect to take total pre-tax restructuring charges of $700 million to $900 million, with approximately half of the charges to occur in 2023 and the balance to be largely taken in 2024. We anticipate the actions will drive savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million, expand margins and position 3M for future growth. We estimate that approximately half of the annualized savings will be realized in 2023. At the same time, we are continuing to build 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets like automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors and healthcare. We are also investing in large emerging markets that demand our material science innovation, including climate technology, industrial automation, next-generation electronics and sustainable packaging. As we move forward, we will drive additional cost reductions through improvements in sourcing, yield, productivity, factory automation and network optimization of our plants and distribution centers. Today, we are also announcing changes to align our leadership to our future direction. Effective immediately, Mike Vale is appointed Group President and Chief Business and Country Officer, a new role on the company\u2019s corporate operations committee reporting to me. In this new role, he will have responsibility for three of the company\u2019s four business groups : Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics and Consumer; and also Country Governance. Jeff Lavers, who is leading our Consumer and Healthcare business, will now lead our healthcare business and support the company\u2019s progress towards a spin-off and the transition to a new CEO and management team. Jeff continues to report to me. Karina Chavez will become Group President, Consumer. Chris Goralski will become Group President, Safety and Industrial. Ashish Khandpur will continue as Group President, Transportation and Electronics. All three are experienced leaders at 3M and well-positioned to help drive the actions we announced today to improve our performance. Karina, Chris and Ashish will report to Mike Vale. In total, today\u2019s actions will make 3M more streamlined and competitive. Now please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our first quarter. In an economic environment that remains challenging, we stayed relentlessly focused on serving customers and aggressively managed costs. We posted adjusted organic growth of minus 5.6% or minus 2.2% excluding our Russia exit and decline in disposable respirator sales. We delivered adjusted margins of nearly 18% and adjusted earnings of $1.97 per share, while expanding our adjusted free cash flow to $900 million. Today, we are affirming our full year guidance for organic growth, EPS and cash flow, which is inclusive of the restructuring charges and related savings. End-market trends played out as expected with ongoing weakness in consumer-facing markets. We saw continued strength in certain industrial markets, including automotive, electrical markets and abrasives. Our actions to reduce costs, which included plant spending, external services, travel and hiring, helped drive stronger-than-expected earnings and margins. We also continued to improve inventory levels, enabling us to deliver strong cash flow. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term value creation as we make progress on the spin of our healthcare business. Turning to litigation, on Combat Arms, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies through mediation discussions. We are focused on achieving a resolution that is efficient and equitable for all parties. With respect to PFAS, we continue to address litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also have a dedicated team to facilitate an orderly transition as we exit PFAS manufacturing and work to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products by the end of 2025. In summary, we are improving day-to-day operational execution, advancing our strategic priorities and taking necessary actions to move 3M forward. We are dedicated to building on our progress, delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders and exiting 2023 a stronger and more focused 3M. Monish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, the first quarter macro and end-market trends have played out largely as anticipated. We experienced significant end-market weakness in consumer electronics, shifting consumer spending patterns along with the retailer destocking and mixed industrial end markets. We also continue to navigate COVID-related impacts in China and the ongoing geopolitical challenges in Europe. Given the expected challenging start to the year, we relentlessly focused on serving our customers and took very aggressive actions to manage costs and spending. These actions, coupled with a lower-than-expected foreign currency headwind, enabled us to deliver a first quarter that was better than forecasted. First quarter total adjusted sales was $7.7 billion or down 9.7% year-on-year. In addition to focusing on serving customers, first quarter sales benefited from a smaller-than-anticipated headwind to sales from foreign currency translation. The first quarter year-on-year translation impact was a minus 2.8% or approximately $230 million versus a forecast of minus 3% to minus 4%. We also experienced a 1.3% sales decline from divestitures or approximately $120 million versus Q1 last year. This decline was largely from the third quarter 2022 divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies. On an adjusted organic basis, first quarter sales decreased 5.6% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $300 million or 3.4 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia last year in the third quarter. Excluding this decline, Q1 adjusted organic sales growth was minus 2.2%. First quarter adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion with operating margins of 17.9% and adjusted earnings of $1.97. Turning to the components that impacted first quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance, our Q1 margin and earnings reflect the previously mentioned lower sales volume. This lower sales volume, combined with our efforts to reduce inventories, resulted in lower manufacturing productivity versus last year\u2019s first quarter. We were able to partially offset these headwinds through pricing performance and aggressive cost management, resulting in a net headwind to margins of 90 basis points and $0.17 to earnings. As mentioned, we faced a challenging Q1 comp from last year\u2019s Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand, along with the exit of operations in Russia. This sales comp headwind resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 1.1 percentage points and to earnings of $0.21 per share. We continued our focus on improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including executing on restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end-market demand. Restructuring charges in the quarter were $52 million or a year-on-year headwind of 50 basis points to margin and $0.05 to earnings per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million or a negative 130 basis point impact to operating margins and $0.15 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 2.8% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 30 basis points to margins and $0.10 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.05 per share year-on-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by higher non-op pension expense. Please turn to Slide 6. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $950 million, up 24% year-on-year with conversion of 87%, up 37 percentage points versus last year\u2019s Q1. This year-on-year improvement was driven by lower annual incentive cash compensation and a strong focus on working capital management, particularly inventory improvement. During the quarter, we continued to address manufacturing production levels to better align with end-market trends. Since last August, we have driven an approximately $500 million reduction in inventory levels. As I\u2019ve said before, as supply chains heal and we progress the use of data and data analytics, we will see a reduction in inventory levels. Adjusted capital expenditures were $445 million in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned nearly $900 million to shareholders. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $12 billion, down 10% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.5x. Please turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 6% organically. This result included a year-on-year comp headwind of $285 million due to last year\u2019s Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand and exit of Russia. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators and Russia exit, Safety and Industrial sales grew nearly 4% organically in Q1. Organic growth was led by high single-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, electrical markets and abrasives, while the personal safety business declined mid-teens primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators, the personal safety business grew low double digits organically. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial, organic growth declined high single-digits in industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronic softness. And closure and masking systems was down low single digits as consumers pull back on discretionary spending, impacting e-commerce shipments. Roofing granules were down low single digits. Adjusted operating income was $562 million or down 19% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.2%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 9, which posted Q1 adjusted sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 11.3% year-on-year, heavily impacted by a significant decline in demand for consumer electronic devices. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 6% year-on-year, in line with global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms and expect to outperform build rates over the long run. Our electronics business saw adjusted organic sales declines in the mid-30% range. This business continues to be impacted by significant end-market weakness along with tiers and OEMs aggressively reducing inventories, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials had adjusted organic growth of high single digits year-on-year, while both transportation safety and commercial solutions declined. Transportation and Electronics delivered $284 million in adjusted operating income, down 36% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 5.5 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. Looking at our Healthcare business on Slide 10. Q1 sales were $2 billion with organic growth of 1.4% versus last year. Excluding the impact on the exit of Russia, Healthcare grew Q1 organic sales by approximately 2%. Sales in our Medical Solutions business and oral care grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while Health Information Systems was flat due to strained hospital budgets. Separation and purification declined high single digits due to the normalization of post-COVID-related biopharma demand. First quarter elective healthcare procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. We continue to expect procedure volumes to improve as we progress through the year. Healthcare\u2019s first quarter operating income was $360 million, down 19% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.9%, down 3 percentage points. Year-on-year, operating margins were impacted by manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material logistics, and energy cost inflation, and investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline, and productivity actions. Lastly on slide 11, our consumer business posted first-quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 6.8% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. Stationery and office grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while the home improvement, home health and auto care business declined organically. Relative to first quarter last year, consumers have shifted their spending patterns to more non-discretionary items and retailers have aggressively reduced their inventory levels. We expect consumers to remain cautious with their discretionary spending as we move forward through the year. Consumer\u2019s first quarter operating income was $179 million, down 18% compared to last year with operating margins of 15%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds and carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions. That concludes our remarks on the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion on our outlook for the year and the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance, reflecting a macroeconomic and end-market environment that remains very fluid and uncertain. Our outlook continues to incorporate the expected second half improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, including in China. We also anticipate the continued healing of global supply chains, which will help support ongoing product cost improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, along with working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions. As a reminder, our full year adjusted organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This range includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. Full year adjusted free cash flow conversion remains forecasted in the range of 90% to 100%. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. First, looking at external macroeconomic forecasts, both global GDP and IPI are currently expected to improve year-on-year and sequentially. The softness we experienced in Q1 in consumer electronics and consumer retail is expected to continue into Q2. We expect both sequential and year-on-year increase in auto bills, while healthcare procedure volumes are anticipated to be similar to Q1 levels and industrial end markets are expected to remain mixed. As discussed, we implemented very aggressive cost controls in the first quarter given the challenging start to the year, including on travel, advertising, external services and head count management. While we will remain disciplined, we expect to increase investments as we progress through the year to support end-market demand improvement in the second half and into the future. Including these factors, our expectations for Q2 are for total adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion versus $8.4 billion last year or down 6% to 8% year-on-year. Organic sales is expected to be down low to mid-single digits, which includes the forecasted year-on-year headwind of approximately 1.5% from disposable respirators. And finally, foreign currency translation is expected to be approximately a minus 2% headwind to sales versus last year\u2019s Q2 and divestitures a year-on-year headwind of minus 1%. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that second quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.75, including a pretax restructuring charge of $175 million to $250 million or $0.25 to $0.35 per share. This range also incorporates the continued softness in organic sales and expected increase in investments, higher non-op interest costs and an adjusted tax rate of 18.5% to 19.5%. To wrap up, 2023 is a pivotal year for 3M from an execution perspective. As I mentioned, we aggressively managed cost, focused on serving customers while navigating end-market weakness, particularly in consumer-facing markets as we started the year. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronics markets stabilize, China work through its COVID-related challenges as our year-on-year comps ease. The actions we announced today will enable us to exit 2023 stronger than we started and provide for significant margin and cash flow improvement into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your may proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Monish, maybe we could start off by just talking a little bit more about the sales cadence during Q1 and here in April because I think, Monish, you mentioned your Q2 EPS guide is modestly below Q1 even ex restructuring. What happened as Q1 evolved here in April? Have you seen signs of consumer and electronics destocking running its course? I know you industrial markets is mixed. Do you see any changes in industrial markets as the quarter evolved? And is it just that increased investment in tax rate holding down Q2 versus Q1? Monish Patolawala : Yes. Thanks, Andy. So I\u2019ll just start again back to 1Q. As we said in the prepared remarks, end markets pretty much played out as anticipated. You had consumer-facing businesses, both our Consumer business and our Electronics business. The Consumer business was down 7%. Electronics was down 35%. China continued to remain soft in Q1. We were down 20% in China. And also the DR and Russia comps pretty much came in where we said. So the end markets played up pretty much as anticipated. Coming into the quarter, we had given you a guide of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion. We came in at $7.7 billion. So that\u2019s at the high end of our range with some of the benefit also coming from a better FX rate at minus 2.8% versus the 3% to 4% that we had guided coming into the quarter. So when you look at that and you translate that into 2Q, I would still say the macroeconomic continues to remain fluid and uncertain. We are still seeing consumer weakness both in our Consumer business and in any of our consumer-facing businesses, especially consumer electronics. And so putting all that into the equation also looking into industrial markets that remain mixed, healthcare and oral care procedures pretty much remaining flat sequentially and then auto will be up a little bit sequentially and also up low double digits year-on-year. But then semiconductor is also down mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. Our current guide is $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion, which then translates to an EPS of $1.50 to $1.75. Included in that, Andy, in that $1.50 to $1.75 is a restructuring charge for the actions that we\u2019ve announced today of $0.25 to $0.35. So if you exclude that for a moment, then on an apples-to-apples basis, you\u2019re looking at $1.85 to $2. And the delta, if your question is about 1Q versus 2Q is the items you correctly said, which is some more investments as we think \u2013 as we look at the second quarter and the second half and the future, investments that we believe we want to take advantage of the markets as they get better in the second half, continuing to \u2013 but we will still continue to remain prudent with our investments depending on how the market evolves. And then it\u2019s the tax rate and some of the non-op that just sequentially looks tighter. But with that said, just for the year, again, we are maintaining guidance, which includes the restructuring charge of $700 million to $900 million for the program. We expect half of that will be incurred in 2023. And the benefits from that program are also $700 million to $900 million. And we expect the benefits \u2013 half of those benefits also to show up in 2023. Just for you to know and for others, we\u2019ve announced a significant announcement today. Some of them are organizational changes and business combinations or division combinations. We will be working through all of the reporting \u2013 our reporting on the new division basis. We plan to do that from 1Q 2024 onwards.. Hopefully, that answers your question, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, Monish. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Mike, I wanted to ask you, $700 million to $900 million cost takeout, obviously, a relatively large program. How do you avoid business disruption and/or lower growth given all the changes you\u2019re going to make here? And then assuming the second half of the program does get executed mostly by \u201824, maybe for Monish, how do we think about 3M\u2019s ability to generate that 30% to 40% incremental moving forward? If you do see sales rebound later in \u201823 as you expect and in \u201824, for example, should you see unusually high incrementals given the program? Mike Roman : Yes. Andy, as I said 3 months ago, we\u2019ve been looking at everything we do as we come through the pandemic, come through the supply chain disruptions even face into the outlook for the year and our markets as we move ahead. So the actions that we\u2019ve come to, they have been something that we\u2019ve been very deliberate about thinking through. They are taking from learnings about what worked well and areas that we know we can improve. So it starts with a pretty strong basis. We\u2019re confident that these are the right actions about positioning us for growth and profitability as we go forward. And it will help us navigate \u2013 as Monish just laid out, help us navigate some of the challenges and uncertainty we have in the current market. So our focus is \u2013 as your question kind of indicated, our focus is on executing successfully. And that\u2019s \u2013 these are significant changes. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ve got the right focus. We\u2019ve made some leadership changes to really ensure that we have our leadership focused on successfully making these improvements. And I think that this is the next step for us. We believe and we\u2019re confident these will be the steps that really help improve our performance in our businesses and our supply chain. And as the second part of your question focused on, it\u2019s about improving our costs and margins. Reducing our costs and improving our margin performance gives us a position to be successful in the future, leverage our innovation to create differentiated value with customers and deliver that to the bottom line performance that we expect both in terms of margins and cash flow. So it does position us for confidence in being able to do that as we go forward that incremental margin from our differentiated innovation. So yes, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the reason and confident we\u2019re positioned at the right \u2013 with the right strategies in place. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi, good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning, Steve. Monish Patolawala : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : So just on this restructuring cost, can you maybe just give us a quarterly cadence on the costs and then the savings? And I mean getting half of the savings this year, that seems like a pretty quick payback on half the spending. Like is there anything unique to this program that would have an accelerated payback like that? It seems like a one-for-one on a quarterly basis, which is pretty fast. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I\u2019ll just start again, Steve. It\u2019s $700 million to $900 million. We expect half of that to be incurred in 2023 and $175 million to $250 million to be incurred in the second quarter. The benefits of that program is also half in 2023, very little in 2Q. So the benefits actually show up in the second half. The reason the benefits are stronger than you would have normally seen as not all of these costs are just people-related costs. We are taking a lot of other costs out from the center of the company, we\u2019re reducing rooftops, et cetera, which allow us to exit some of these cost structures faster, and that\u2019s why you get a better payback. Stephen Tusa : And so as far as the cadence of the charges, is there \u2013 is it \u2013 should we assume that they are spread throughout 3Q and 4Q and additionally with the savings, 3Q and 4Q? Monish Patolawala : Right now, I would just focus on 2Q and the total year. And we will update you, Steve, as we get through the announcements today and work through all the people-related costs and work through the rules and regulations in various countries. I would just focus on total year-end and 2Q. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then what was \u2013 as far as like the go-to-markets are concerned and how you\u2019re changing things, what was the catalyst for this? What did you see in the business that you thought you needed to improve on from a go-to-market perspective with all these changes that you were talking about? It seems like some pretty significant initiatives from that perspective and a change in the way you guys have done business historically. What was the catalyst for that? What did you see that you didn\u2019t like? Mike Roman : Yes. I think the catalyst is really the learning and experience that we\u2019ve gone through over the last few years. We put in place a business-led model really around our go-to-market models. We also put in place a global supply chain model that was end-to-end managed in one consistent model across the world. And we\u2019ve been operating that through the pandemic, through the supply chain disruptions. Our businesses are learning, the go-to-market models that we have in place, we\u2019re learning how to optimize those. And I would say we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten to a point when we look at where our markets are going in the future, where we want to invest, how we want to operate best to serve our customers. It\u2019s really a learning \u2013 more of a learning over that experience than a catalyst. There is a catalyst, that\u2019s to position ourselves as we take action now for the future, make sure that we are stepping into the changes that will both drive the performance in the near-term and also position us for the future. So the learning was really \u2013 and I think the clear view of what we can do to improve in the go-to-market models and also in our supply chain that is really, like I said, giving us the strong focus on the actions that we\u2019re taking and announcing today. Monish Patolawala : Can I just add one more, Steve? As \u2013 I\u2019ve always said this before, digital is a multiplier for 3M. And some of the digital capabilities that we have built over the last few years allows us to serve customers better. For example, Mike mentioned one of the areas where we are relooking at how we go to market in certain countries where in the past, we have had a full roof stop and a full cost structure, and now we\u2019re going to work through our partnerships of third-party distributors, leverage our digital capabilities, leverage our export capabilities. And that also allows us to reduce cost while making sure we still continue to take care of customers in those countries. Stephen Tusa : Great. Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Mick and Monish, Bruce. Mike Roman : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Scott Davis : We\u2019ve got a couple of different \u2013 I mean this restructuring is large as the fellows have said. But you\u2019re also going to be getting out of the PFAS manufacturing business. Is that included in the restructuring? Or there\u2019ll be separate actions kind of sequentially on top of that as you exit each of these things? Mike Roman : Yes, Scott. The PFAS exit, I would say this, we are executing what we announced at the end of last year and working to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products and working to exit the manufacturing. It\u2019s not a specific focus in the restructuring actions. That\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got a dedicated team following through on that set of actions, and we continue to make good progress. We\u2019re working closely with customers and, I would say, making progress on our innovation to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products across the company. So it\u2019s a separate focus, separate team and a separate strategy for us. Monish Patolawala : Just to remind us, Scott, from a numbers perspective, when we announced the exit of \u2013 the intent to exit our PFAS manufacturing and reduce our use of PFAS in our products, we had announced a fourth quarter charge. We said the total program would cost us $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. In the fourth quarter of last year, we took a charge of $800 million, which was largely non-cash. We continue to make progress around that. Our current excluded numbers include what that \u2013 the extra charge in the quarter. For a total program basis, we still expect to incur right now $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. Scott Davis : Okay. And Mike, I wanted to just ask you on R&D productivity. I mean when you think about the investments that you guys have made over the last 50 years forever, there has been time periods where growth has been great and a lot of support on the margins. And then there is been, perhaps the last decade, where I\u2019d characterize growth is pretty minimal and maybe not as much support in the margin structure as you had in the past. But is part of the restructuring and the changes you are making to help drive more accountability and productivity in R&D? Is it \u2013 is there a \u2013 I mean I guess, a more polite way to ask the question is, is there any cultural or structural problems in R&D that you can address and perhaps improve that productivity going forward? Mike Roman : Yes. Scott, I think it\u2019s an important part of the actions we are announcing today, I would say, is to position us to be successful in delivering on the differentiated value that is 3M innovation. And we are always innovating around how we do that. We \u2013 I talked about in the announcements today that we are prioritizing some large, high-growth market segments where we have strong commercial presence and we can leverage strong innovation. So, I think if there is a kind of a consistent message over the last year or so from me is that we are prioritizing more and more where we focus that R&D investment. It\u2019s still the first priority in our capital allocation, invest in R&D, invest in CapEx to drive that growth. We see the opportunities in those high-growth market spaces. We also called out and we are \u2013 as part of our actions that we are announcing today, we are putting in place a central group to really focus some of the capabilities that we have in broad material science going after some emerging market segments like climate tech and industrial automation, sustainable packaging. Next-generation electronics has got over the horizon some really exciting spaces. So, it\u2019s about continuing to evolve that prioritization. And the businesses, they have got, I would say very clear focus on where their priority markets are, where their customer opportunities are that they can really create the most differentiation. So, that\u2019s the, I would say a continuous innovation and evolving nature of how we think about investing in R&D, how we think about driving growth. And our goal remains the same, to leverage our innovation, to grow at or above the macro of the economies that we are part of and really focusing on those high-growth market segments so that we can do that. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. Good luck guys. Mike Roman : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on China. I think you guys called out China down 20% in the quarter. Was that worse than you guys anticipated? And it sounds like there is an expectation of China stabilization or improvement as the year goes on? Is there anything you are seeing here through April maybe that gives you confidence that things there are getting better? Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, Chris, we did call out down 20%. It\u2019s pretty much played out exactly where we expected it to be when we gave you the first quarter guide. And in the second quarter, currently, we are expecting China to be down low-single digits to mid-single digits. But sequentially, a few days into April, it\u2019s pretty much playing out where we saw. And just talking to customers, talking and looking at all the external factors, there is an expectation that China GDP grows and increases in the second half sequentially and year-on-year. And our full year guidance, as I have talked about, assumes overall recovery in all economies in the second half, including China. And as supply chains continue to heal, we should start also seeing the productivity or cost reductions in our cost of goods to start showing up in the second half. And so sitting right now, that\u2019s how we see China. China was impacted heavily by consumer electronics down in the first quarter, and that\u2019s also reflected in our results. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the destocking that you are seeing at the customer level. I think you guys called out retail as destocking year-to-date. And then we have seen the same in the data. Can you maybe just talk about where you think the supply chain is in that destock cycle? Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. Chris, we talked a bit about the consumer retail destocking as we came into the year, and we saw that play out in Q1. There \u2013 I would say, in the U.S., in particular, retail has been destocking in the discretionary categories. And we saw that, and that was part of our expectation and pretty much played out as expected. We see that getting back to closer to your more consistent weeks of stock, but there is still probably some destocking to continue there, not maybe as aggressively as we saw in Q1, but we still see that playing out as we move ahead. We are also seeing destocking, I would say, across some of the industrial markets. So, we talked about that back on our Q4 earnings call as well that it was maybe out of cautious view of the outlook, and I would say that has played out as expected. We saw destocking in China around the slowdown in electronics. Also, in automotive, we \u2013 China saw a slowdown in automotive builds in Q1 and Asia more broadly destocking around electronics. I think the automotive levels more broadly given the growth are relatively in balance, maybe even low in some areas. Healthcare is pretty well aligned with the market and the recovery that we are seeing in procedures. I think the consumer is also seeing the dynamic of seasonal builds. There are some seasonal builds going on in the channel as well. So, some destocking, which played out as expected in the first quarter, I would say some of it carrying into the second quarter as we go forward. And then when you see the downturn in demand in electronics, there is naturally some destocking in the channels related to electronics as well. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Mike Roman : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I just want to follow-up on the restructuring program. Mike, Monish, I think you guys have had a few programs now over the last several years. And I know that they are approaching different aspects of the cost elements and different regions, etcetera. But trying to roll up to where do you see the margin entitlement for the business as we get through these programs over the next several years. Is there anything that you sort of have pencil out there that we should keep in mind, especially with a few of these programs overlapping and different mix changes, etcetera, going on within the business? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Josh. So, I would say a couple of things. One is, of course we have to have these programs work through. As we said, it\u2019s $700 million to $900 million. A large piece of those charges will be completed by 2024. So, you would start seeing the benefit without these charges in 2025 and beyond. That time, of course you had to think through what the revenue is. But if you just use 2023 as a guide, as a basis, the margin expansion, excluding these charges are when these charges are done, is a 200 basis points to 300 basis points of margin expansion that you should see on an annualized steady-state basis. What I would tell you is that allows us to definitely get the better leverage that we have all been talking about. But the second other factor that comes into play is, as supply chains start to heal, you should start seeing productivity and cost-out starting to show up, which again is in our second half guide for the year. But that should continue into the future years. And then you add on data, data analytics and the digital capabilities that we have, that will allow us to do better network and logistics optimization, also dual-sourcing programs kicking in, etcetera. So, we should continue to see margin rates expand into the long-term once these programs are done. So, hopefully I answered your question, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And I will leave it there with the interest of time. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Hi. Good morning everyone. Monish Patolawala : Hey Joe. Mike Roman : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, I know we have had a bunch of questions on the restructuring. I want to delve in a little bit deeper there because there is lots of cost levers that you described. I am just curious, is there a way to bucket perhaps like some of these \u2013 how big, like whether it\u2019s reducing the layers or supply chain is in that $700 million to $900 million cost-out? And then maybe specifically on the simplification piece, again, any kind of quantification, like how many P&Ls are you streamlining? Any other color around that would be helpful. Monish Patolawala : So, Joe, the $700 million to $900 million, if we just break it down to broad buckets, 40% of it is around the supply chain simplification that Mike talked about. The remaining 60%, you can split between costs at the center of the company and costs at the BGs. From a P&L perspective, a couple of items that Mike talked about, again, on the go-to-market. There will be a couple of divisions in TEBG that will be combined. And then from a consumer perspective, we will serve our customers more from an area perspective and then realign them around portfolios. And the other piece on a go-to-market cost saving is, as we look at some of the countries, the way we serve using our digital capabilities, we will look at using our partnerships that we have with our third-party distributors in those countries and use a digital/export model to serve those customers in those countries, which will also allow us to take out rooftops and fully loaded P&Ls in those countries that will also allow us to save cost. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And maybe my follow-on question, I didn\u2019t hear it earlier, but how much pricing came through this quarter? What\u2019s the expectation going forward on price/cost? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So, depending on the business group, Joe, we had anywhere between low to mid-single digits. The average is low-single digits. The guide for the year is low-single digits. And at the same time, as we have said before, if we continue to see inflation, we will readjust as needed. The teams have done a good job, I would say, of looking at it product-by-product, market-by-market and making the right necessary price moves as required when they see inflation. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe leave aside the firm-wide restructuring for a second. And I just wanted to focus on the healthcare business as that\u2019s meant to spin out in a matter of months. The margin is down pretty heavily year-on-year again, down sequentially as well and not a lot of organic growth. So, just trying to sort of understand how comfortable do you feel with that healthcare business kind of ahead of the spin? Are we seeing a big front-loading of investments, so it has kind of less to do post-spin? Just trying to understand kind of the approach there for this year and why those margins seem to be under such pressure. Mike Roman : Yes. Julian and I will come to kind of the organic growth and margin. I would say we continued to see the healthcare procedures as an important driver of our healthcare performance. And there, we see some improvements. Monish highlighted in his prepared remarks some of the headwinds and challenges that are still \u2013 the labor shortages and some of the challenges and healthcare recovering to pre-pandemic levels. So, that\u2019s important factor in driving our growth. If you look at our business, we also had some headwinds from the Russia exit in DR and so close to 2% organic growth. And we expect as procedures do recover that we will see improvements in our organic growth. On the margin side, Monish called out some of the headwinds, we have \u2013 still seeing some supply chain headwinds, still seeing some carryover from material, raw material and logistic inflation, energy cost inflation. And we are making some investments, investing in \u2013 it is a prioritized area of growth for us, and we are making and really staying focused on those investments. So, it\u2019s a \u2013 it is part of the performance in the quarter. But again, confident that as procedures improve, we will see growth and growth gives us the best leverage to the margin. We will see those margins improve as we see some of the supply chain healing and some of the actions that we are taking help impact that as well. Monish Patolawala : Just one more to add is biopharma. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, biopharma this quarter was also impacted due to the normalization of COVID-related demand. And as Mike mentioned, the healthcare business is \u2013 for us is a great business. We will see volumes grow as elective procedures grow, oral care procedures go and biopharma demand comes back once we get the normalization out of the way from an inventory level. And with all that put together, the margin rates will also go up as volumes come through. But this is again a segment Mike has called out multiple times an area where we see great opportunity, which means we will continue to invest in that segment to make sure we take advantage of long-term growth. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just my follow-up on electronics specifically, I think you mentioned, Monish, that was down sort of 35% in Q1 year-on-year. It looks like the second quarter is down maybe in the teens based on Slide 13 in electronics. How are you thinking about that sort of rate of improvement? What\u2019s baked into the back half for electronics in your guidance? Do you think we should see year-on-year growth by the fourth quarter for electronics? Any sort of color there around how you are looking at that business through the balance of the year? Monish Patolawala : Yes. That\u2019s \u2013 you got it right. Right now, our second quarter is also going to get impacted continuing inventory challenges and destocking at consumer electronics, whether it\u2019s tablets, notebooks, TVs. Our view is that as China stabilizes as we start seeing our comps ease compared to last year, fourth quarter should be on a much more normal run rate, which means on a year-over-year basis, it will show positive growth. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Roman : Thanks. Nigel Coe : Yes. Great. Thanks. So, just wanted to touch on the Mike Vale as Group President, just first of all, congratulations to Mike. But how does this change your role, Mike Roman, in terms of your focus areas? I mean Mike is obviously \u2013 seems like he is getting direct for the three segments. I mean how does this change your focus areas going forward? Mike Roman : Yes. Nigel, I think it\u2019s a reflection on really what are the strategies and actions that we are driving and the priorities that we are focused on right now and the importance of having leadership that brings the necessary focus as we go forward. And so it\u2019s even looking back to 2022, the \u2013 some of the pivotal actions that we announced as we came through the year, they are the healthcare spend, our actions in terms of our supply chain changes, focusing our leadership now with the actions we are announcing today to go further and really make the changes in our \u2013 the next set of changes in our supply chain, moving forward with our new go-to-market models. Mike\u2019s role is really focused on that. When I talk to Mike about stepping into this leadership role, it\u2019s about really ensuring success as we drive these actions and changes forward, position us for the future, help the businesses working with the supply chain to be successful in integrating these changes and building for the future, help us to focus on the high-growth market segment. So, it\u2019s really about putting up \u2013 taking our priorities and putting a strong leadership support in place to drive that. These are important and really significant actions that we are putting in place and important that we have. We also are supporting our leadership with a dedicated project management office. These are significant changes. So, it\u2019s really a strong statement about what\u2019s most important both on the restructuring, but also on our strategies in terms of growth and executing for our customers. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Mike. And then one for Monish, just a follow-up on Joe\u2019s question on pricing. It seems like given the 1.3 percentage points hit to margins from raw materials, it seems like price/cost was positive this quarter. Just wondering if there had been any change in the way you are viewing the supply chains to raw material kind of dynamics for this year. Monish Patolawala : Yes. No change. I would say it\u2019s the same. So, price/cost was positive, and the teams continue to manage both. As we think about the second half, that\u2019s where supply chains, our belief is supply chain start healing, which means we should be able to see better cost \u2013 product cost from our factories as well as the cost from sourcing. That should continue to help us build on margins, which goes back to where \u2013 what we have talked about at earnings, talked about it at last quarter earnings, currently too, that all of this is baked into our guide where we see supply chain starting to heal in the second half and even markets starting to heal in the second half because as you know, we have talked about volume gives us the best leverage. So, those are the two things we are counting on in the second half. Nigel Coe : Alright. Thanks a lot and good luck. Monish Patolawala : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Mike Roman : Good morning Deane. Deane Dray : Can we get an update on the healthcare analyst meeting? And what\u2019s the effect on the separation of R&D? There is so much in way of shared technologies. What\u2019s the plan there and also for stranded costs? Mike Roman : Yes. Deane, maybe I will make a comment about the R&D. So, this is something that we have managed with other separations and divestitures and nothing of the healthcare spend scale, but it\u2019s something that we are able to manage. We have \u2013 part of the focus of the separation team is on this area, and it\u2019s important to be able to set up both healthcare and 3M going forward with the strong foundation for innovation that they both need. And you \u2013 the fields of use are actually quite distinct between healthcare and what will be 3M Company going forward. So, that\u2019s a really a big part of it. And then we work through the details, make sure that we are positioning both companies to have the \u2013 not only the access to the technology, but the intellectual property that is at the foundation of what makes our innovation really that differentiated. So, making good progress on that and feel like that\u2019s an area that we have a good roadmap ahead for us to follow. Monish Patolawala : Just on your second question on timing. As you know, Deane, last quarter too, Mike had said, the teams are continuing to make good progress. This quarter too, they are making good progress. We were going \u2013 we were working towards a Q4 \u201823, early 2024 timeline. But just a reminder, our spin timing ultimately is subject to the IRS rulings because we want this to be a tax-free transaction, government approvals, making sure we get final Board approval and also take into account other conditions like equity and debt markets, other external conditions that could impact \u2013 on other developments that could impact 3M or any of its business. So, put all that together, I would just say that teams are focused, dedicated teams continuing to make progress, working through all the government regulations that we have to work through to get ready. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. And just if you can comment on the plan for stranded costs, and are there other spin-offs being contemplated by the Board? Monish Patolawala : So, I will just \u2013 on stranded costs, when we announced this transaction mid last year, one of the items we have talked about was that benchmarks were anywhere between 1% to 1.5% of revenue is stranded cost. And we had talked about saying, we believe we can do much better than that. Based on all the actions that we are taking today, currently, our view on stranded costs ultimately depends on the revenue of ParentCo too is between 50 basis points to 75 basis points, so much lower than benchmark. But we will keep working it. We will keep working it from now until the end of the \u2013 until the spin-off. And we will keep working it post that too, to reduce that. Mike Roman : And Deane, I would say we are focused on successfully moving forward and making \u2013 successfully making progress with the spin of healthcare. And we are, of course focused on the actions that we announced today. So, we don\u2019t plan on any other major portfolio actions in the near-term. Deane Dray : Thank you. Mike Roman : Yes. Thanks Deane. Operator : And our final question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mike Roman : Good morning Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Hey. In the interest of time, I am just going to ask one, and that\u2019s, can you just comment on how organic growth kind of trended throughout the quarter, if there were any discernible differences between Jan, Feb, March and then into April? Thank you. Monish Patolawala : So, Nicole, I would say overall, the quarter pretty much played out as we thought. Jan, Feb, March, we expected acceleration, which we saw. April is also playing out pretty much where we saw. So, there is \u2013 I would say there was nothing in the intra-quarter trends in Q1 that stood out from where we had expected it to be. China remains soft, consumer-facing businesses remains soft, industrial end markets ex-electronics remain strong. And then healthcare elective procedures pretty much remain the same. And you normally in that industry see a Q4, Q2 or 1Q slowdown just as procedures slow down, and we saw that too. So, nothing I would say is major to call out intra-quarter in 1Q. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks Monish. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we are taking significant actions to create a streamlined and stronger 3M. We will stay focused on creating greater value for customers and shareholders, improving our performance and using 3M science to make a difference in the world. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Officer. Mike, Kevin and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on the important actions we have been taking to improve our performance and shape the future of 3M. We posted adjusted organic growth of negative 2.5% which includes a negative 1.7% headwind from the expected decline in disposable respirator sales. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, impacted by restructuring charges of $212 million or a headwind to adjusted operating margin of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding these charges, we increased operating margin year-over-year. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion driven by continued improvements in inventory management. Today, we are updating our full year earnings per share guidance to $8.60 to $9.10, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, realize additional benefits from our restructuring actions and position 3M for the future. In the quarter, we maintained a strong focus on serving customers, driving operational execution and maintaining spending discipline. All business segments delivered sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Our restructuring actions and strong focus on cost management drove these margin improvements. Looking at our markets, trends played out as expected. We saw strength in automotive, both OEM and aftermarket, as well as highway infrastructure and personal safety, excluding disposable respirators. Health Care which was up slightly, continues to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related demand, notably in our Biopharma, Health Information and Medical Solutions businesses. We also saw continued weakness in electronics, consumer retail and China. Please turn to Slide 4. As we focus on improving our performance and managing a dynamic external environment, our teams are driving 3 strategic priorities : improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation. We are on track with our restructuring actions and have made significant progress in leaning out the center of the company, simplifying our management structure and streamlining our supply chain. The changes to our enterprise supply chain organization are enabling improvements in service, cost and inventory which helped drive our second quarter results. We are also taking advantage of the continued healing and supply chains to reduce logistics costs and improve production yields. We've also made progress in advancing our go-to-market models to bring our innovation closer to customers. In support of these changes, to date, we have initiated the transition to a new export model in 24 countries. I am pleased with how these changes are helping drive performance. We've made good progress on our planned spin of our Health Care business, including regulatory filings and system updates in preparation for soft spin. We are also in the final steps of naming a CEO. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to the required conditions and additional factors we have disclosed in our SEC filings. Last month, we announced an agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve public water systems claims nationwide in the AFFF multi-district litigation. This agreement will benefit U.S.-based public water systems that provide drinking water to a vast majority of Americans. The settlement covers all forms of PFAS. As we announced, we have taken a Q2-related charge of $10.3 billion payable over 13 years. Also related to litigation, we continue to participate in the confidential mediation process as part of the Combat Arms MDL and we'll provide updates as appropriate. To provide additional details on our PFAS settlement agreement, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Please turn to Slide 5. Kevin? Kevin Rhodes : Thank you, Mike and good morning. This is an important step forward for 3M. As Mike said, we have entered into a broad class resolution with public water systems that provide drinking water to the vast majority of Americans. We are taking a proactive approach to managing PFAS by establishing a more certain path forward for public water systems, communities and 3M. Subject to court approval, 3M has agreed to support PFAS remediation for public water systems that detect PFAS at any level and our agreement addresses all PFAS, not just those compounds that have been the primary focus of litigation to date. Our agreement also provides funding for eligible public water systems that may detect PFAS into the future and we have agreed to fund additional testing by public water systems as well. As Mike shared, the agreement terms entail a present value commitment of $10.3 billion paid over 13 years. Additional details regarding the payment schedule are available in our Form 8-K filed in June. While this agreement provides an alternative to continued litigation for class members and for 3M, we remain prepared to defend ourselves in litigation should the agreement not receive court approval or should public water systems choose to litigate instead. We are building on actions 3M has taken and continues to take. We were the first company to exit the manufacturing of 2 forms of PFAS, namely PFOA and PFOS which we announced more than 20 years ago. We have invested in state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations. And we have announced that 3M will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We will continue to build on this important progress as we focus on the future and work to proactively manage PFAS. Now, let me turn it over to Monish to provide more details regarding our performance in the quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Kevin and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Our second quarter performance was driven by continued focus on serving our customers, improving manufacturing and supply chain productivity while also maintaining strong spending discipline. Also, during the quarter, we initiated a large part of our restructuring program to simplify and streamline the organization. We are aggressively reducing management layers and rooftops while also streamlining our go-to-market models and supply chain, bringing us closer to our customers. End-market trends continue to play out as anticipated with ongoing weakness in electronics, soft discretionary spending patterns in consumer retail and mixed trends in industrial end markets. Regionally, China's recovery has been slow, impacted by electronics and soft export trends. Europe remains challenged as the uncertain geopolitical situation persists, while end markets in the U.S. largely remain steady. Second quarter total adjusted sales were $8 billion or down 4.7% year-on-year. This result was a little better than forecasted as we experienced a smaller-than-anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation of minus 0.9% versus a forecast of minus 2%. On an adjusted basis, organic sales declined 2.5% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand. Excluding this impact, Q2 adjusted organic sales declined 0.8%. On an adjusted basis, second quarter operating income was $1.5 billion with operating margins of 19.3% and earnings of $2.17 per share. These results included pretax restructuring charges of $212 million which negatively impacted adjusted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points and earnings by $0.31 per share. Without the impact of restructuring, second quarter adjusted operating margins were 22% or up 40 basis points versus last year and earnings were $2.48, up $0.03 year-on-year. Turning to other components that impacted results year-on-year; we were able to more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and inflation impacts through improved manufacturing productivity, benefits from restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices while continuing to invest in the business. The net result was an increase to margins of 1.4 percentage points and $0.15 to earnings. The previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirators resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 50 basis points and to earnings of $0.09 per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $30 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.04 to earnings. As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 0.9% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 20 basis points to margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, did not impact margins but resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.06 per share year-on-year primarily driven by a lower share count which was partially offset by a lower non-op pension benefit. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending is starting to yield results. These actions, coupled with improvement in global supply chains, drove sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins across all of our business groups. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins improved 3.6 percentage points sequentially. Please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion, up 44% year-on-year with conversion of 122%, up 50 percentage points versus last year's Q2. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory and the timing impact related to restructuring charges. Inventory was flat sequentially versus a typical historical build from Q1 to Q2. We continue to adjust production output to end markets and leverage the power of daily management and data and data analytics to increase the velocity of inventory turns. Adjusted capital expenditures were $328 million in the quarter or similar year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividend. Net debt at the end of Q2 stood at $11.7 billion or down 12% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of Health Care at 3 to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake, will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now, please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 4.6% organically; this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 4.8 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial sales grew 0.2% organically in Q2. Organic growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket, while personal safety declined due to last year's disposable respirator comp excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking declined due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity, while industrial adhesives and tapes continue to be impacted by end-market softness in electronics. Adjusted operating income was $614 million or down 2.4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.2%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and up 2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10 which posted Q2 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 2.4% year-on-year, largely due to the continued decline in demand for electronics. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 21% year-on-year, approximately 600 basis points higher than global car and light truck builds. Our electronics business continues to be impacted by soft end-market demand for electronics. As a result, this business experienced a year-on-year decline in adjusted organic sales of approximately 22%. Electronic end markets continue to remain highly uncertain. We expect our year-on-year organic growth rates in electronics to remain negative in the second half, however, improve versus down nearly 30% in the first half as we start to lap easier comps. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics; transportation safety grew high single digits organically, while commercial [indiscernible] digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $369 million in adjusted operating income, down 19% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.8%, down 3.6 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased 3.1 percentage points sequentially. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. Looking at our Health Care business on Slide 11; Q2 sales were $2.1 billion with organic growth up slightly versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up low single digits year-on-year and Medical Solutions business grew slightly. Separation and purification and Health Information Systems declined mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. These businesses continue to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand and ongoing stress on hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve, hospital budgets stabilize and we work through post-COVID-related impacts, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's second quarter operating income was $411 million, down 16% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19.8%, down 2.8 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased sequentially 1.9 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. Finally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending on hardline categories remains soft. We expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year. Organic sales grew slightly in home, health and auto care, while home improvement and stationery and office businesses both declined. Consumer second quarter operating income was $235 million, down 5% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year but up 3.2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volumes, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing. That concludes our remarks on the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year expectations. During our January earnings call, we highlighted that we expected macroeconomic and end-market uncertainties to continue to persist into the year. In addition, we noted that we were starting to see the healing of supply chains. However, we expected to continue to see headwinds from raw material availability and inflation, although at a lower level than 2022. We also stated that we were not satisfied with our performance and we would be taking a deeper look at everything we do as we continue to prepare for the spin of Health Care. As a result, we noted that as we move through the year, we would be taking additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us closer to our customers. While we have more work to do, let me take a moment to provide a few examples on the progress we have made through the first half of the year. Starting with our sales performance. While end markets continue to play out as expected, Q1 and Q2 revenue was slightly above our expectations. Our teams continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers, work down backlogs and leverage the use of data and data analytics to drive improvements in demand planning. Next, as we have mentioned, we are aggressively addressing structure. We are on track with our actions to reduce structure across the company, including at corporate, in our business segments and in manufacturing supply chain. We have initiated the transition of 24 countries to an export model, partnering with local distribution to serve those customers and markets. In addition, we have made good progress in reducing corporate structure, including the exit of our aviation operations and our conference center in Northern Minnesota. And finally, we continue to adjust our production levels to end-market trends, manage inventory and aggressively control spending. As a result of our actions, along with improvements in global supply chains and raw material availability, we are able to deliver first half performance better than anticipated, particularly for margins, earnings and cash flow. In the first half of the year, on an adjusted basis, we delivered sales of $15.7 billion, operating margins of 18.6% and earnings per share of $4.14. These results included $264 million in pretax restructuring charges or a headwind to margins of 1.7 percentage points and to earnings of $0.38 per share. In addition, our strong operational execution and working capital management, particularly inventories, helped us to deliver $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with a conversion rate of 105%. Turning to guidance; we are raising our full year adjusted earnings expectation as a result of our strong first half operational execution as evidenced by an improving margin rate. We now expect full year's earnings in the range of $8.60 to $9.10 versus a prior range of $8.50 to $9. We continue to closely monitor end-market trends across all our businesses, particularly in electronics, consumer retail, industrial and China and have yet to see signs of improvement in trends. Therefore, we currently see organic growth tracking to the lower end of our range of flat to minus 3%. This reflects our performance to date along with our year-on-year headwind from disposable respirators tracking to the high end of our anticipated range or down approximately $550 million along with continued macro and end-market uncertainty. And finally, our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion expectation remains unchanged in a forecasted range of 90% to 100%. Looking ahead to the third quarter; we expect end-market trends to be very similar to Q2. Hence, we anticipate third quarter adjusted sales to be approximately $8 billion. The impact from the COVID-related decline in disposable respirators and last year's exit of Russia is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind to sales of approximately $130 million or 1.5 percentage points. Third quarter pretax restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $175 million with pretax benefits of $125 million to $150 million. Taken together, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40. To wrap up, we continue to have a strong focus on serving our customers, improving the execution in our supply chain, making progress in our restructuring actions, managing costs and investing in the business while navigating ongoing end-market weakness. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and improve our organic growth, margins and cash flow performance into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I am confident in our future. As we have said, as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on the outlook. I think operationally, second quarter was quite strong. And I appreciate your commentary on organic growth but where is the caution in terms of operational results in the second half? What segments, what verticals are you particularly sort of concerned about, as I said not to raise guidance more given strength in the second quarter? Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Andrew. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when we came into the year, we thought we would have end markets that remain uncertain as well as economic uncertainty would exist. Looking at where we in the first half, as I've called out, electronics continue to remain soft. We were nearly down 30% in the first half. We had consumer spending continue to remain soft. The consumer discretionary spending continues to remain soft. China remained soft in the first half. And then when you put all that together, you look at it and say, what are the trends we are looking for in the second half. And so what we are watching is electronics and see whether it's hit its bottom or not, we believe that electronic softness will remain. It's still going to be negative for the year but less negative in the second half. Consumer spending has remained soft in the first half. We believe it will remain soft in the second half. So we are watching back-to-school season and holiday season. Industrial activity has remained mixed. There are certain markets that continue to remain strong. There are certain markets that we are seeing a little bit of destocking in there. Health care elective procedures, we believe, will continue to go up on a sequential basis. At the same time, Biopharma and Health Information Systems are still constrained. Biopharma is going through COVID-related demand and HIS, or Health Information Systems, is impacted by stressed hospital budgets. As I've also mentioned in my prepared remarks, DR right now looks like it's going to be at the worst end of our range of down $550 million versus we thought it was going to be $450 million to $550 million coming into the year. And in China, we have -- second quarter was weak, down 4% on lower comps and we currently have not seen much of the recovery show up in China. Plus as a reminder, it was a tough comp in -- through 3Q of last year as China was coming out of COVID. So when you put all that together, Q3 is very similar to 2Q. And overall, the trends that we see make us feel that where we are right now in the first half and where we see trends going in the second half, we feel that from a revenue guide basis, we'll be at the lower end of our guide that we had given which was flat to minus 3% coming into the year. But with that said Andrew, if markets change, we will definitely be there to serve it. The teams are executing well as you have seen in the results that we have announced. We've got momentum on supply chain and supply chain execution. The team is doing a great job on restructuring and driving the cost as well as the team has hyper focus on making sure we are continuing to be prudent on our cost spending. But as we see these markets start to evolve in the second half and into 2024 and beyond, we won't hesitate to invest in growth in the high-growth markets because ultimately, we are in for the long run. Hope I answered your question, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. No, I mean it's still sort of margin was pretty solid. But let me drill down on consumer electronics maybe a little bit more. What would it take for this business to finally turn positive? Or is it just sometime early next year, the comps get so easy that it can decline anymore? But what KPIs in terms of end markets are you watching? Mike Roman : Yes, Andrew. Maybe I'll pick up on Monish's description of what we're looking at in the second half. And if you look a little further at the consumer electronics, we saw a soft first half in -- across all consumer electronics category, smartphones, TVs, notebooks, tablets. It -- you just saw -- and it was impacting our results as Monish outlined. And as we look into the second half, maybe there starts to be projected recovery in the markets in fourth quarter but really third quarter looks like the first half. And I would say picking up on inventory in the channel, we see destocking in a slowdown like this. And so we expect some destocking to continue in the electronics channel. So as we go into third quarter, that's kind of forming the view that we have. Now what would we need to see? We would need to see a turnaround in demand in those particular build rates in those end markets. And we'll see, I think, confidence show up in the inventory in the channel as well. So we're watching each of those categories closely in consumer electronics. And we also keep an eye on semiconductor capacity as well and how that's being -- how production is changing there. That gives you an indication of demand as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So I just want to delve in a little more into your margin performance in Q2 and what it means for your second half. I mean, obviously, you had a nice step-up in sequential margin despite absorbing the 2.7% of pretax charges. So how do we think about the durability of the productivity actions, the positive price versus cost that look like was going on in the quarter? And how do you think about margin performance embedded in Q3? And Monish, the second half as it looks like you're forecasting margin below Q2 and Q3. Monish Patolawala : Yes Andy, I'll just start first with your question on sustainability, et cetera. There have been a few questions on cadence of restructuring charges and benefits. And we have attached an appendix that shows you by quarter where we expect to be for 2023 which is charges in the range of $400 million to $450 million and benefits in the range of $400 million to $450 million, so self-funding. The total program, as a reminder, is between $700 million to $900 million of charge and $700 million to $9 million -- $900 million of benefits. From a cadence perspective, depending on how the restructuring announcements play itself out, we've given you 2023, we expect 2024 charges by the end of 2024 to have pretty much taken most of the restructuring charges. The benefits, of course, show up in '25 and beyond. And once all these charges come to an end, the benefit is between $700 million to $900 million. Your second piece on where are we starting to see margin, as you have seen coming into the second quarter, one of the reasons for us able to beat expectations in the second quarter was driving supply chain efficiency. So factories started to heal better, raw materials started to flow better which allowed us to have longer runs. But at the same time, the work that the supply chain team has done under Peter Gibbins is starting to drive the execution and we are starting to see that in the results. And then, of course, the team is hyper-focused on cost control. So to answer your question on second half and how this plays out, one is you do have to adjust for the restructuring cost by quarter and you will see that the margin rate is climbing. Secondly, when we came into the year, we had said OI or operating margin will be somewhere in that 18.5% to 19% range. Sitting right now with a lower revenue number with a higher EPS number, we believe that we'll be somewhere in that 19.5% to 20% range which includes all the charges and all the benefits. What we are watching also is, to answer some other of your points, raw material and energy cost inflation coming into the year was $150 million to $250 million. We have now changed that to $150 million to $200 million. So we are starting to see the benefit there. What we have seen so far Andy, is disinflation which is lower inflation than last year. We are seeing the benefit in logistics. But however, some of our commodities still continue to be inflation. Inflationary and labor, frankly, is sticky from an inflation perspective in those commodities. But that also will play itself out as events play out through this year and into 2024 and beyond. And then we will continue to be focused on cost. Another item for us in the second quarter -- second half is as we are getting ready for the spin of Health Care, we'll be, of course, standing up the new management team. Mike already talked about that in his prepared remarks. There will be some cost incurred from a -- as these -- as we have management teams appointed that start getting ready to be -- have Health Care be a stand-alone company. And then, on -- I would just say on another housekeeping item is other financial, when we came into the year, we had said it would be minus 10% to flat on a year-over-year basis. We are updating that to minus 5% to flat -- minus 5% to plus 5% which on the midpoint is 0. First half, we got benefited by $0.11. Second half, it will be a negative $0.11 but that's on a year-over-year basis. So I gave you a lot Andy, just to make sure that you have enough information as you build your models out and you look at us in totality. Andrew Kaplowitz : No, that's very helpful, Monish. And then just for the next question, maybe just a little more color into industrial businesses within Safety and Industrial. I think you'd guided to down low single digits for the year and you continue to be down mid-single digit in Q2. I know last quarter, you described industrial markets as mixed, same description this quarter. But maybe you can characterize markets for us. Do you still see low single-digits decline for the year in industrial? Mike Roman : Yes Andy, the quarter down mid-single digits, that was also impacted by disposable respirators down as we talked about, so about flat for the quarter outside of disposable respirators. And as Monish outlined, we're going to see more to the high end of our range of what we expected for disposable respirator declines in the year which means in third quarter, we'll see an impact from that as well. And when we talk about mix, it's really across the portfolio. We're seeing some strengths in our roofing granules, our automotive aftermarket business. The demand for car repair and around that business is strong. We saw some softness in electrical markets and abrasives. Our industrial adhesives and tapes business is impacted by electronics. So that's feeding into the industrial business as well. Personal safety, excluding disposable respirators, has been showing strength, up high single digits in the quarter. So that's kind of the mix picture. I -- we're also in the channel, we're seeing some caution from distributors. They're cautious about the outlook for industrial markets. They're also seeing the benefit of improving and healing supply chain. So cycle times are improving and they're pulling back on some inventory. So that's having some impact on our businesses as we come through the quarter and our outlook for the second half. So it's a mix. And the impact from China is part of that as well. We're seeing the slowdown in the markets there or the slow first half and not yet seeing an upturn in that and looking for that as we go into the second half. So, that kind of gives you a view across the -- what we mean by mix markets. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I'm curious, just overall, are you seeing areas or particular products or markets where you're getting some pressure to drop your prices, particularly given some of the weaker demand? Or do you feel like you can hold on to some of those price increases that you've gotten the last couple of years? Mike Roman : So yes, Scott, I would say as you see -- Monish called it disinflation, moderating of inflation. You're going to start to have discussions around impact on price. I would say when we look at it, our price value is in the right place where we are, where we face our markets. You -- I would say the area where you have the most discussion, typically are retail markets. It's an ongoing discussion, it always is. Even in the times of high inflation, it's a strong discussion. But price is a topic everywhere, right? We're confident that we're priced in the right place as we come through this market dynamic broadly. So we're not looking at pressure specific in one segment or another. But I would say the conversation is something that we anticipate as we see disinflation and eventually, we see deflation, then we would expect it to ramp up. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. And guys, a little bit bigger-picture question. When you talk about supply chain streamlining, what do you mean exactly? I mean, how do you balance kind of the -- I'm assuming that means kind of localization. But between balancing between resiliency and not being relying on any particular supply partner but sometimes there's added costs that come into resiliency. So how do you think about streamlining and the cost-benefit of streamlining? And maybe you can give us a more concrete example of that to help us understand what that means specifically. Mike Roman : Yes, Scott, maybe I'll step back for a second. As we came through the pandemic, we saw a lot of factors impacting our supply chains. Inflation, labor shortages, raw material availability, all that was impacting our production runs and really creating inefficiency in our factories, impacting yields. And as we came into this year, we started to see supply chains healing. We're seeing labor availability improving. Our -- Monish highlighted, we're still seeing inflation in labor. Raw material availability has improved. And we put a lot of focus during the most difficult times in the supply chain disruptions on multiple sources for raw materials. And we were engaging with many suppliers, hundreds of suppliers, on a monthly basis to try to manage those raw material interruptions. As they've healed, that's become much more focused on a few raw materials. We're seeing much better availability. All this is helping us run our factories a little more efficiently. We're seeing improvements in yield. We're seeing improvements in logistics as supply chains heal more broadly. And so as we stepped into the restructuring, we were taking stock of what we learned during the pandemic, what we learned during the restructuring, also what we learned as we moved to our global operating model. And so streamlining is really taking advantage of all those learnings and I would say also taking advantage of investments in data and data analytics, our digital strategies, investing in productivity, more broadly in our manufacturing models. And so streamlining is focused broadly across our supply chain. I talked about we're working to improve every aspect of it, better, more disciplined planning, taking advantage of data and analytics, stronger focus on sourcing, that dual sourcing, taking advantage of that strategy, what we can learn in the plants about running more efficiently and how we can manage logistics more efficiently. So plan, source, make, deliver, we're streamlining across that really taking advantage of the learnings and I would also say stepping into aligning to customers in our business models. And it's going to continue to be an opportunity for improvement. We'll continue to evolve this. But the restructuring actions really try to incorporate those learnings. And it wasn't a top-down. We're going to take out so much head count. It was how do we restructure, realign, streamline our supply chain plan, source, make, deliver to take advantage of all that and position us in the markets that we're in but also position us to be ready for a stronger performance as we go forward in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : I appreciate the additional details on the restructuring, Monish. Just -- my first question really just around that deflationary point. Things are getting a little bit better or better than you originally expected. It seems like most of the inflationary headwinds have already occurred for the year. And so do you expect that to turn positive, I guess, by 4Q? Or is that something that could turn positive in the 3Q numbers? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So Joe, I think you have to break this up into multiple pieces. What I've said before is what we are seeing is lower inflation than a year-over-year. Our headwinds are somewhere in the range of 150 to 200 between electricity and carryover of raw material inflation. We have done 100 in the first quarter and we have done, I would say, between 25 in the second. So we still got a little to go on carryover. But when you talk about new inflation, I'll break this up into logistics costs are seeing in lower costs, partly driven by we are also reducing the amount of premium freight that we used during the pandemic because raw materials are flowing better. You are still seeing inflationary items in downstream. So upstream materials have started to show signs of moderation of inflation but from a downstream perspective, labor cost is still pretty sticky in inflation. So what I would say is we'll have to look commodity by commodity, market by market. And as things evolve in the third and fourth quarter, you should start seeing some of the cost on a year-over-year basis get better. If you recall last year, it was, I would say, October, November was when you started hitting peak of inflation and then you saw markets starting to moderate. It will also, of course, depend on ultimately what happens with monetary policy. It will also impact -- depends on demand that you're going to get from China and the rest of the end markets that we play in. So all put together, our current view is that things have gotten better, especially logistics. Material is flowing better which is definitely helping us run our factories better. We are seeing cost out and the teams are doing a nice job of driving it. But it will take a little bit of time for it to show up, depending on our year-over-year comp and how much of that material will be actually consumed based on the volume we produce. Long answer to your question but it's multiple materials. So it's not one that we buy, unfortunately. Joe Ritchie : Yes, that's super helpful. I guess my follow-on question, I know we talked a little bit about the weakness in electronics but I want to go back to it for a second. Is there a way to maybe just kind of parse out exactly what you're seeing in that end market? And then specifically, I know that Apple is considering rolling out like an all-OLED iPad next year. And I know when we went through that transition a few years ago on smartphones. That was a hot topic for your company. Any thoughts just around that specifically and how that impacts your business? Mike Roman : Yes, Joe, I'll go back to my earlier comments. The decline that we've seen in the first half has really been driven by reduced demand in smartphones, tablets, TVs, those different categories. There is an ongoing shift in the display technology from LCD to OLED. And that's something we had talked about. As you noted, we talked about it a number of years ago, anticipating it. We continue to innovate on the OLED platforms but we do see some impact from that shift as we see the continued movement away from LCD to OLED in a few of those categories. So there's some impact from that. The bigger impact, again, is the demand in the end markets, smartphones, TVs, tablets and laptops, a few -- those categories. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris Snyder : I wanted to ask on the restructuring program. So for Q3, if you just annualize the expected savings, it's about $500 million to $600 million which isn't far off the full $700 million to $900 million range which sounds like we shouldn't expect in 2025. So there's another $400 million to $500 million of spend coming post-Q4 '23. Is there any reason that the savings are maybe tracking a little bit ahead? Is there anything that's front-weighted that we should be aware about here? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Chris, a great question. So your math is right. I would also look at fourth quarter, where we have said $185 million to $235 million. You take that midpoint and you annualize that, you'll get to -- closer to the overall annual range. But when you look at the way our charges are, some of it is rooftops, some of this is noncash charges and some of it is restructuring people. All that put together in the first half, we have done $262 million. What is left to go which is, I think, your question in '24 and beyond, what happens with the cost, there are a couple of things. Geography by geography, we go through negotiations, make sure we are following all the regulations in there. So there will be a cost for that. And then we've got some other rooftops, et cetera, that take a little longer for us to exit that also happen in 2024 and beyond. So that's why you're seeing this the way it is right now. Chris Snyder : Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. And then, it certainly feels like the savings here are coming in a bit quicker maybe than previously thought. I did not think there's anything in the guide for Q2 restructuring savings which obviously came through. Does that change the way you think about the plan over the next couple of years into 2025, just seeing the savings come through faster than you thought? Monish Patolawala : Yes, I would say, listen, on Q2, the teams knew that we had to execute well and early and they've done a nice job. Some of the benefit came from head count. But a lot of the other benefits that we've got, as Mike mentioned about streamlining the corporate, we were able to go after a lot of indirect costs in those areas, including exiting some of the rooftops that we wanted to that we were planning to early. So again, it goes back to a lot of focus on cost control, making sure that where we are spending our money on an indirect perspective also is well focused on. And that's where we were able to get to be off to a better start than we expected. So I give the team a lot of credit. They're going through very granular level of detail, making sure that we are doing the right amount of spend and focusing in the right place as we get the best return. So my credit to the team. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with biopharma. So this is an area where we've seen weakness post-COVID for some time now. Have there been any green shoots there? I don't know if you think about like orders or what customers are saying about spend to the second half? Mike Roman : Nicole, I -- well, I highlight biopharma as being one of the impacts on solid growth in health care is really a reflection of the post-COVID dynamic. So saw strong demand in biopharma for vaccines and therapeutics and we ramped up to serve that and the industry did broadly. And what you're seeing is kind of the other side of that demand and also the inventory, working off the inventory that was built up and trying to respond to that demand. So we're seeing both aspects of that. The space, the opportunity that we see for innovation and for us, growing the business, we see this as a long-term growth driver. We have new solutions that -- and one of the reasons we had value as we came through the opportunity vaccines and therapeutics is we could combine steps in processing, multiple steps into one. And so that demand is going to be there. As we look forward, the recombinant protein therapeutics are an opportunity going forward or just near term working through that post-COVID dynamic, both in end-market demand and inventory in the broader channel. Monish Patolawala : Nicole, I'll add one more is we are very confident and bullish about this business. In fact, we have added capacity to continue to have more production output out there as the demand comes back. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. And just to clarify, in your second half outlook, like what's baked into the Health Care business? Have you embedded any improvement in biopharma? Or is the expectation that that's more of a 2024 dynamic? Monish Patolawala : So as I've mentioned, there is slight improvement that you're going to see in -- overall in Health Care. One is electric procedures should go up. Biopharma demand should start settling down. Hospital budgets are hopefully starting to bottom but we don't know that. So we'll have to see what happens with elective procedures. But overall, I would say there is improvement from a first half to second half in the market in general in Health Care that we have embedded into our guide. On the other hand, the thing we are watching also is oral care, Nicole, or orthodontics. Because as you know, if the economy slows down, that's an area that people will control their spending on. And so that's the other thing we're watching and, of course, China and seeing how the recovery in China plays itself out. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Mike has said it multiple times too, this is a great business. In the long term, this will continue to have very good growth. We are working through some comps from last year which was COVID as well as capital budgets and hospitals. But all those trends in the long term will turn themselves around. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa : Just -- can we just calibrate? Because there's a lot of moving parts around the adjusted sales numbers. I think your guidance implies roughly like $7.9 billion in sales, like a modest sequential step-down from the third quarter just on an absolute basis. Is that right? Monish Patolawala : It's $8 billion. Bruce Jermeland : For Q3. Monish Patolawala : For Q3. Is that your question? I'm sorry. Stephen Tusa : No, Q4, Q4, Q4. Monish Patolawala : Yes. Stephen Tusa : What's implied? Monish Patolawala : Yes, it would be around that range, between -- it's somewhere in that range. You're right. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Okay. And can you just give us an idea of the range of the absolute margin? I mean we could probably do a lot of backing into it but what you now expect for the year from just a range on an absolute margin basis? Monish Patolawala : Between 19.5% to 20%, Steve, versus the 19% that we had told you coming into the year. Stephen Tusa : That's great. And then, just one last one on these liabilities. So what was the change in the mindset from really drawing a bit of a hard line and talking about how the science made you guys look at this stuff and then taking what is still a pretty sizable $10 billion to $12 billion charge? Like what -- like that's a pretty significant change in mindset. Mike Roman : Yes, Steve... Stephen Tusa : What drove that internally? Mike Roman : Yes. I think over the last several years, we've been talking about taking a proactive approach to managing our litigation and that includes the whole PFAS docket. And it's been part of our strategy and we talk about it kind of in short form that we're going to proactively manage it, defend ourselves in court and work to resolve through mediation as appropriate. And that's been really the guiding strategy and how we've looked at it. So as things evolve, we are making decisions around that frame. Stephen Tusa : Does it matter where the stock price is and what that's reflecting when it comes to your -- how you think about this stuff? Mike Roman : The addressing litigation, our strategy there is independent of what the share price is doing. I mean, certainly, there's an overhang in the stock price and the uncertainty around that. And we are focused on doing what we can to address litigation, help address that uncertainty. That's something we've been discussing with investors over multiple years. And so that certainly plays into it from that standpoint. We don't like the overhang on the stock and we want to manage it. But we've got to -- as we move forward, we've got to do what's in the best interest of the company for the long term. And so that gets back to we're going to defend ourselves in court and we're going to work to resolve as appropriate. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Dan Rizzo : This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. Just a quick question on inventories that you've managed so well. How should we think about inventory turnover in the long run, I mean, over the next few years? What is kind of the go-forward thought process? Monish Patolawala : Yes. You -- as I've said before, as supply chains start to heal, one of our big opportunities or opportunities to continue driving cash flow as inventories. The teams have done a really nice job of starting to use data and data analytics. We are getting better at doing demand planning. So I would say in the long term, you should see trends continue to improve from an inventory turns perspective. Because as supply chains heal, as we get better on demand planning, that's why you're going to see it. So you will see it get better in the long run. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing remarks. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we continue to execute in a dynamic environment. While we see progress and positive momentum, we have more work to do. And we'll continue to advance our restructuring actions, control costs, strengthen our supply chain. At the same time, we will drive our strategic priorities, improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation. I thank 3Mers for their contributions and commitment, especially as we continue to lead through significant chain. We will stay focused on driving growth, improving operational performance and delivering value to customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financia. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation acCompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website @3m.com. Please turn to Slide two. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide three and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers, positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all four businesses, and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth in free cash flow. As we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10, and our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously. We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions, and spending discipline. We are progressing the spin of the healthcare business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address combat arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities. Next slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion, excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges. We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs, and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our Company, simplified our global supply chain organization, and optimized our global go-to-market models. At the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins, and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants. We are also progressing the spin of our healthcare business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024. During the quarter, we added two experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the Standalone Healthcare Business and Kerry Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the combat arms settlement, and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun. With respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval. We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M. As we prioritize attractive markets, where we have the right to win, and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths; a good example is our automotive OEM business, where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year to date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business, and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement, and consumer electronics. We are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation, and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third-quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our healthcare spin, and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower costs, better margins, and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow, prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact, and empowering our teams. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide five. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through a focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline, and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third-quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high-end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion, operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially; earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3%, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high-single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remained soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end-market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year. Our strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly two-thirds of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and a balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pre-tax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges. Turning to slide six for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance, manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline, and selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, investments in the business, and the previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia, resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share. Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million, or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings. Foreign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of aero technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings. Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year. In summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions, and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to slide seven. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year, with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points, versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by an ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory. Inventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms. As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated one-time dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of three to three and a half times EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now, please turn to slide nine for our business group performance. Starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically, this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million, or 4.3 percentage points, due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically. Closure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity, and industrial adhesive and tapes by end-market softness in electronics. Abrasives, electrical markets, and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics. Our electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft.  We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11, Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related bio-pharma demand. Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price. These benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hard-line categories remains subdued. The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending. Consumers' third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price. That concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment. As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously. Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pre-tax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33. To wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future. As we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Good morning, Mike, Monish, and Bruce. I haven't been able to say this in a while, but a pretty solid, complete quarter overall, so some progress there. But, guys, I want to back up a little bit. What are the remaining steps to get health care spin complete? Any big hurdles still remaining? Michael Roman : Yes, Scott, I would say the team continues to make very good progress. And so we don't see any hurdles ahead of us. There's a lot of work to do to get ready for the spin and so we've got work to do, getting ready for each step of that process. As we talked about in my remarks, we named the CEO, and we're adding to the leadership team and getting that built out. So that's really an important foundation. We have the Board Chair named and continue to work on filling out the Board. So those are important steps. I don't see -- the team has given us great confidence that we're going to continue to progress. And we're on track for the timing that we talked about in early 2024 and see ourselves getting there successfully. Importantly, for us, it's -- much of it is and we've talked about, it's about getting ready for the spin of health care, it's also about getting ready to stand up 3M as a stand-alone Company with a health care spin being completed. So we're putting focus there. And even what we talked about in the quarter that really driving the priorities that we are talking about, the execution in our operational execution is an important part of getting ready for 3M for the spin as well, and we're making good progress there, as you noted. Monish Patolawala : Just process-wise to add to Mike's comments, the teams are working through system changes, standing up legal entities and as well as all the regulatory filings, Scott, that we need to do, and that's what everyone is focused on from the health care side. Scott Davis : That's helpful. So Mike, just taking your comments a little further, at the new 3M, do you envision a new 3M or you can kind of run at lower levels of CapEx, lower levels of even potentially R&D as a percent of sales. And the knock on 3M was always that it costs a lot of money to drive a point of growth and sometimes with the incrementals that worked out well. But in down cycles, that certainly did not work out well. But is there a new vision in 3M, I should say, that you can run at kind of more productive, efficient levels of CapEx and R&D? Michael Roman : Yes. Scott, there's a couple of dimensions to the answer to your question. The first starts with what we've been talking about. We announced a restructuring back in Q1, and that was really coming from what we had learned as we operated our businesses and we looked at where we were going with our supply chains in the face of some of the challenges in supply chains globally. And it was really behind that was an expectation that we could drive greater productivity, improvement in our execution, stronger performance, improved margins. And so that was really the foundation of that restructuring. And so I think part of the answer to your question is we took those decisions to lean out the center of the Company, simplify our supply chain, streamline our go-to-market models. Those are a foundation for the future of 3M. And those are -- you can see starting to demonstrate that we can drive improved financial performance for the Company. And that's -- we expect that to be a foundation for the future as well. I even talked about this is with that performance starting to build some momentum, we can accelerate how we view the future. And then you are talking about investing in growth and innovation and productivity and sustainability. And we'll continue to be our capital allocation, first priority is going to be investing in organic growth in R&D and CapEx. And really, thinking of and targeting high-growth market spaces, places where we can differentiate ourselves with our innovation capabilities where we can be aligned to emerging market trends. So I think that how we prioritize that investment is going to be aligned with where we see that ability to make a difference. So both are important foundations for the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Just a question on electronics. It's been a headwind for a while. What KPIs are you looking at? When do you think -- and I think you said that was broadly in line with expectations. But when do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? When does it bottom -- what does it take for this business to bottom? Michael Roman : Yes, Andrew, I would say we came through third quarter. We still saw as we said soft end markets for electronics, and that's consumer electronics, it's into semiconductor. It's into a big part of our -- what we have as a focus in our customers and electronics. When we look ahead, there's some uncertainty, we're starting to see, as Monish said, electronics stabilize. I think that really reflects that we don't see it continuing to go down. It's starting to stabilize. There's some -- companies are talking about things getting better as they go forward. I would say we're watching it closely. We expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3 in our end markets, and I would say electronics included. So we're watching what we always watch. Our customers are large electronics customers in consumer electronics and semiconductor associated with data centers and those are the -- that's where we're going to be taking the lead from where we see demand going, where we see market performance going, when we see the market improve. We'll take the lead from them. Monish Patolawala : Just another data point for you, Andrew, at the end of second quarter, we had said that the way we predicted electronics was the amount of negative Vs quarter-on-quarter would get better. So if you compare us to the first half and the amount we were down year-on-year versus the third quarter, we are less down. It doesn't mean we are not down, but that's another point that Mike was trying to make is that's where we are starting to see some signs of stabilization. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we'll have to just watch how the holiday season plays out. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up question on health care. I appreciate that you guys are doing a lot of sort of sort of accounting, et cetera, et cetera. But you have done the separations in the past. And I guess the question I have, any thoughts, as Bryan has joined the Company, I know in the past, there's been headlines about Health Information System being separated. I know there are other sort of businesses inside health care. Any thought about sort of maybe repositioning the portfolio as particularly as Bryan came on board, repositioned the portfolio for sort of future as a stand-alone Company. Michael Roman : Yes, Andrew, going back to really how did we think about the strategy to spin out health care. And one of the important questions was do we see health care as a leading health care technology Company attractive to shareholders with a great future. And that portfolio of businesses, the answer for us was yes. And that the -- the best way to create that value was to stand it up as a stand-alone Company and the portfolio work we had done even over time as part of 3M position it to be a successful stand-alone Company. And each of the businesses play an important role there. Now it is going to be an independent Company. We'll have a new CEO and a Board and they will develop the strategies for how they think about creating the greatest value driving growth for that business, thinking about how to really manage that portfolio of businesses as they go forward. So we see it as being ready to stand forward as a leader and are really confident in the leadership that will take the Company as a stand-alone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can we start just on the restructuring, the benefits and the push out a little bit of the expenses? Just -- it seems like you're running ahead of schedule on the benefits. So I'd love to get any color about where this is. What you see coming in better than expected? And then also just on the push-out on the cost into 4Q, just what were some of the reasons for why the costs are getting pushed out from 3Q to 4Q? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I'll just start, again, as a reminder, Joe, the total benefits for this program over the period of the program is $700 million to $900 million, with costs approximately of $700 million to $900 million. And coming into the year, we had said for 2023, we would see benefits in the ranges of $400 million to $450 million of benefits and equal offsetting charges. So when you look year-to-date, we are, I would say largely on track for the year, we still believe will be in the $400 million to $450 million of benefits, which will get offset by cost of $400 million to $450 million. So the teams have done a really nice job of continuing to execute. There are multiple pieces to this program. One was corporate simplification. The second was streamlining our supply chain. And third was making sure that we are closer to our customers in our business group units. And all three of these programs are running well on track. As regards to just timing from Q3 to Q4, I would say nothing big. We operate in multiple countries, as you know, and we wanted to make sure we follow all rules and regulations in those countries. And so some items dropped from Q3 to Q4, and we had a couple of other small investments that we had to make in Q3. They're just based on all the work the teams are doing, we just felt better to do it in Q4, so nothing major. So still pretty much largely on track, $400 million to $450 million of benefits for the year and $700 million to $900 million for the program. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful, Monish. And then I guess -- I know it's probably too early to think about 2024. But if you kind of think through like the price/cost equation from here on out, it seems like raw materials are becoming less and less of a headwind for you guys. Can you maybe just provide any type of framework for 2024 and ultimately, like how you think about both price and what you're seeing from a raw mat perspective? Monish Patolawala : So, I'll just start first, Joe, by 2024 is a little ways away. So I think our first focus is just getting Q4 done, getting the teams continuing to focus on our priorities. You've seen what our teams have done. So we continue to execute on our priorities. You've seen we have delivered a solid Q3. We have taken guidance up for the whole year. We're gaining momentum, and we want the team to continue to focus on doing that getting 2023 closed out. So when we get into 2024 and Q4 2023 earnings call, we'll definitely give you an update on 2024. To answer your question on deflation and price, I'll start with deflation. I'll start by saying, first of all, the headwinds that we have seen or the carryover headwinds are approximately $25 million in the quarter, which we called out, which was very similar to Q2. When you look at overall market and material, I would say we are seeing more disinflation than deflation. When you think about places where energy is still a little more -- is still inflationary, downstream materials are still inflationary and then labor is still sticky from an inflation perspective. Where we have seen some benefits is upstream chemicals and logistics and the teams have taken advantage of that. But I would say more importantly, I don't think the teams are just focused on material cost, they are more focused on saying, how do we drive overall cost down in the factories, whether it is driving yield and efficiency, whether it is dual sourcing, whether it is making sure we have alternate materials. That's what Peter Gibbons and the team is working. And the work that they have done through this year is clearly evident in the results that you're seeing. So that team has done a very nice job. And then when it comes to price, I would tell you, we came into the quarter -- into the year, we said low single digits price increase. That's what we are -- as of right now, we are on track with pretty much the same range. And Joe, as you know, you've followed 3M longer than I have. This is not a formula-based pricing. We are very thoughtful about it. We look at it market by market, product by product, and we make sure that the price that we are charging our customers is a representation of the value that we -- that our customers get. And I would say, if you leave 2024 aside for a moment, long term, 3M has always had a very good price/cost equation because of the value that we add to our customers. And I don't see that changing. And I believe that with the innovation that we bring with the customer focus that we have that, that equation remains. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. One thing that has really stood out to us over the last couple of quarters is the underlying margin improvement of the business. if we ex out restructuring spend and savings, we see an operating margin on the underlying business of roughly 22% this quarter, first, less than 21% in Q2 and like a mid-'18 in Q1. So a very strong ramp here. Can you just talk about what's driving that outside of the restructuring, why is the underlying business seeing so much margin momentum? Monish Patolawala : So I would say, first, Chris, it's a huge thanks to the 3Mers who have been focused on their priorities. The priorities, as Mike mentioned, driving performance across all of 3M, spinning out health care, reducing risk by managing litigation is all starting to show up in the results. To your point, even if you exclude our restructuring costs and benefits, the margin rate is -- has shown a pretty good ramp. And that's driven, I would say, by two or three things. One is continued execution in the supply chain, with some of the restructuring that we have made and the supply chain is definitely more agile. We are also using a lot of data and data analytics. We have also learned through the pandemic on how to continue to operate our supply chain. So number one, you're starting to see the benefit of the improved yield and efficiency, you're able to take longer runs to as material gets better. Secondly, the team has been very thoughtful in proactive cost management to the extent where they saw there were places they could invest, they have; to the extent where we had lower volumes, we have managed to control cost. Third is we have had a relentless focus on working capital with inventory, and you're seeing that from a cash conversion basis. So I would just say it's continued good, strong operating performance that you're starting to see. And then as you add on the benefits that you get from the restructuring and once the cost goes away, which we have said this program will take approximately two years to complete out, you can see the overall, long-term benefits from the margin rate that you're going to get from better operating performance as well as better restructuring benefits. At the same time, you've got to keep in mind that we are that -- the teams are going to continue to watch this in the fourth quarter. It's an uncertain macro. But I'm very confident with what we're doing that the execution is there, but there's always more we can do, and we'll keep trying to drive more and more execution as we go. Christopher Snyder : I appreciate that. And maybe kind of taking that and bridging to the Q4 guide. It seems to us by our math, that you're kind of guiding underlying operating margins ex restructuring to something like 19% down from the almost 22% this quarter. I know revenue is down, but it seems to suggest a very sharp decremental. Can you just maybe talk about what's causing that margin step down? Because it feels like a lot of the improvements, whether it's supply chain or price cost are sustainable. Thank you. Monish Patolawala : Yes. Chris, again, depends on the math. I'll just start with margin rates in total. When we started the year or we came into the year, we had said margin rates for the year are going to be around 19%. At the end of Q2, we said margin rates are going between 19.5% to 20% for the year. And now based on where we are with the midpoint of our guide, our margin rate will be approximately 20%. So when you back into it, the fourth quarter is higher than the 19.5% that you have, it's somewhere in that 20.5% to 21% for the fourth quarter. And just to keep in mind, the reason you see this decremental. One is, of course, the restructuring is higher in Q4 versus Q3, plus it's higher of -- the midpoint is $95 million to $100 million of restructuring on a year-over-year basis, if you're doing year-over-year decrementals. The second piece to keep in mind is, in general, revenue in 3M drops from Q3 to Q4, you have less billing days or less business days in Q4. That's why our revenue guide, which is going from $8 billion, it goes down to between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion, which is basically saying the underlying macro trends are the same. It's just lower billing days or lower business days, which also puts an impact. If you look at the history of 3M, Chris, and you look at Q3 to Q4, you will always see a pretty sharp decline from Q3 to Q4 in margin rate. And that's mainly driven by just the lower volume because of the less business days that come into Q4. Hopefully, that answered your question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. So, Monish, I think at a conference a month ago, you had lowered your revenue guidance a bit and you sort of report $8 billion -- I think you had $7.9 billion to $8 billion. So maybe you can talk about the cadence of revenues for the quarter. Did any of your businesses pick up in September here in October? Are you just being conservative at the time? And then how are you thinking about the impact of higher rates on your businesses? Monish Patolawala : So I'll start by saying at that moment in time, what we saw is what we told you all, which we felt was in that $7.9 billion to $8 billion. There Was uncertainty in electronics, consumer and China, I would say, thanks to all the focus the teams have on taking care of customers, we were able to get to the high end of our range of $8 billion. I would say the same trends, Andy, pretty much stayed through the quarter. Electronics pretty much was where we thought it was going to be. China continued to remain weak and so did consumer retail. As Mike mentioned and so I have in my prepared remarks, we are seeing electronic stabilizing. We are watching for the fourth quarter what the holiday trends will bring for consumer retail. Back-to-school was softer than we expected. And then China, again, I would say is we are -- it's pretty much the trends we expected in China. Overall, for the fourth quarter, you'll see us having revenue of $7.6 billion to $7.7 million, which is again just driven by the fact you have less business days. On the other side, if you look at margin and you look at what the teams have done, the teams have continued to be very good on an operating execution perspective. We have continued to drive proactive cost control. We've done that in Q3. We'll continue to do that in Q4. And as a result, we were able to beat the 225 to 240. I had said in that conference a few months ago, and then we have raised totally a guide from 860 to 910 to 895 to 915. And then the other point, Andy, that's another bright spot is the cash conversion. The teams have done a marvelous job managing inventory, 130% free cash flow conversion in the third quarter, which has allowed us to raise our total year guide of free cash flow -- adjusted free cash flow conversion from 200% to 110% from 90% to 100%. So overall, the team is focused on operating execution. Andrew Kaplowitz : Monish, if I can follow up on that, the cash conversion target raise. Maybe talk about your efforts. I know you talked about improving digitization at the Company, it seems like you're focused on digitization inventories having impact. So maybe you can talk about the confidence in generating higher cash conversion going forward, sort of the duration of these improvements as you go forward in '24 and beyond. Monish Patolawala : Yes. From the day of coming here, Andy, I've said working capital is a great opportunity for 3M. And through the pandemic, unfortunately, we had to build inventory levels and most companies did just to make sure we took care of our customers. And our first priority was always to take care of our customers. So we made sure we had enough inventory. As two things, as supply chains are stabilizing, number one, but more importantly, the execution that the teams are doing using data and data analytics and not -- and what I mean by that is not just going and using analytics, but being able to visualize by looking at data, they are able to see where the inventory is better. They are able to get a better demand signal, which allows them to get a better manufacturing signal, which allows them to get a better supply signal to their suppliers. And then the third piece is with all the work that we have done through the restructuring, where we have got the supply chain streamlined and restructured so that it's more agile. All of that is playing itself out in the inventory that we are seeing. I would tell you, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's more to go here. There's more that we can keep driving in this space. And we are going to continue driving it because this is a great place where we can continue to generate very strong cash for 3M. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. What are you planning and assuming for the auto strike impact for 4Q? Michael Roman : Yes, Deane, so it's something we're watching very closely. We're -- as you know, we stay very close with the automotive OEMs, our key customers there. We are -- we haven't seen a significant impact on our business to date. And we continue to watch it closely. We're staying connected on what happens week-to-week and impacting our demand. But it's something that as part of -- an important part of our global automotive business, the automotive as we talked about in the quarter, had very good performance. We had 16% growth in the quarter, outgrowing build rates and that's the broader core of our automotive business, our auto electrification business is growing even faster. So it's an important part. It's had some impact but relatively small impact to this point. Again, we're watching it closely as we move ahead. Deane Dray : Got it. And then you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, the back-to-school sales were weak. Can you quantify that just maybe year-over-year? And then how does this set up for holiday sales with consumer being weak, higher rates? What's the assumption there as well? Michael Roman : Yes, Dean, I probably would point you back at some of the data out there about year-over-year spend back-to-school being down per student. There's a number of metrics out there. For us, our category broadly in consumer is exposed to like shifting discretionary spend. So that continues to be part of the consumer story. So it wasn't back-to-school story, only back-to-school was muted. We didn't see the strong replenishment cycles that we would have seen in a stronger back-to-school. So I think we confirmed the data that's out there. And as we look ahead, we're -- I would say we're just looking at the uncertainty around what happens for the holiday season as well. And so we'll be monitoring that. And again, there's a broader story around consumer, retail for us, the shift of spending from discretionary products into areas like food and I would say, experienced kinds of spending, that trend has continued. So those are both underlying some of the performance that we saw in consumer in the quarter and how we're thinking about it into Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Stephen Tusa : Hi, good morning. Could you just give just an update total expected now inflation kind of carryover for the year? I know you mentioned it in the second quarter. Is that unchanged relative to what you had said before? I think it was like $150 million? Maybe that changed? Monish Patolawala : No change, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then I guess, low single digits for the year on pricing. So that's kind of like a mid-single-digit volume decline. That kind of feels already recessionary. Things seem like very stable for you guys revenue-wise. How much of that negative 5% do you think is a function of destocking versus trend line on demand? And then just one last one for the fourth quarter. How much of that sequential sales decline are you expecting from electronics seasonality? Michael Roman : Yes. So Steve, maybe just thinking about the -- take the channel dynamic first, if you want. I would say -- when we look across the channel where we're seeing some destocking as in industrial channels, and that's really -- I think we talked about that last quarter, too, as supply chain performance has improved and stabilized. We're seeing the industrial channels shorten up their replenishment cycles. And so they're managing their inventory maybe back to more normal levels prior to when we got hit with some of the supply chain disruption. So that's the one destocking effect. There is some destocking in consumer that played out. The biggest part of that played out over the last year, retailers focused pretty heavily on taking out inventory. That seems to have played out, although there's some of that with the soft demand that's continuing. So it's, I would say, the rest of it -- when I look across the channel, otherwise, it's pretty stable globally; maybe some adjustments in China in some of those same markets as we continue to see the macro looking for where the macro goes as we go forward. Looking as we move ahead, electronics, we talked about stabilizing. It's really, Monish pointed out, it's part of it's a year-over-year comp. Remember last year, third and fourth quarter, we saw a decline in the electronics end markets, and we saw that in our businesses. So that's part of the view that Q4 stabilizes that year-over-year comp gets a little more -- changes a little bit as we lap some of those earlier declines from the first half. So I would say, we're staying close to that holiday season and what happens. That's an important season for electronics, and we'll be watching that closely as we go into the quarter. Monish Patolawala : Steve, I'll just add. I'll just add -- I just wanted to add one more disposable respirators is down $600 million on a year-over-year basis. That's approximately 200 basis points of growth. Stephen Tusa : Right. So sorry, are you assuming kind of normal sequential seasonal decline in electronics, you are? Michael Roman : Yes. Well, in the broader business, we have seasonality. Some of that is normal end market cycles, but it's also billing days as well. We have the holiday season. So we see it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we see that normal trend. Stephen Tusa : Right, which you've always had, of course Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Hi, good morning guys. So you can have too many electronics questions. So what's got my attention in Electronics is the sequential growth from 1Q through to 3Q has been quite sharp. I think 1Q was about 680. I think 3Q is a 750 or so. I mean I know some of its seasonality, et cetera. But it must give you a lot of confidence that as we go into 2024, that at least in the first half of the year, we should be -- that should be a nice tailwind to the business. So any thoughts on that? Michael Roman : Well, Nigel, I would say it's going to depend on the outlook as we get to 2024 for electronics and those key end markets that you're talking about it. And we've seen -- maybe that's part of the stabilization that we're seeing is the quarterly trend in electronics and against that year-over-year comparable is stabilizing in the second half. What will decide the performance in first quarter or first half of next year will really depend on the demand that we see. And some of that will come through the holiday season, but we'll be -- we'll come back at our Q4 earnings call and update on how we're looking at the first half of next year. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And then I don't like to ask same macro questions necessarily, but you are pretty -- cycle, very channel-centric. The flash PMI for the U.S. was at 50 in October. Are you seeing more stabilization or maybe some sequential improvement in the U.S. relative to Europe and China? Michael Roman : Yes. I think Monish called out the performance in the U.S. was up slightly, and -- and that, I would say, mixed performance in our industrial businesses in the U.S., reflecting some areas of strength, but also some, I would say, caution and uncertainty around the broader economy. So I think we're seeing the U.S. performing a little better, up slightly. And that's -- I would say that's in spite of the challenges that we've been talking about in consumer retail. So Safety and Industrial posted, I think, mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. in the quarter. So that's a good reflection on what we're seeing more broadly. And maybe that PMI is aligned to that. That PMI represents kind of a middle kind of expectation from the purchasing managers Monish Patolawala : Just only other thing Nigel I will add to Mike's comments is just in certain pockets, we are seeing customers managing inventory channel. And part of it is supply chains are definitely far more stable. So customers have lower lead times, so they're managing that in pockets. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning, thank you very much. One quick question. I just wanted to circle back on your sort of pricing outlook as you see it because volumes have been soft for some time. Headline inflation in theory is easing. Traditionally, you do have price pressure in areas like electronics, just through nature of the industry. So I just wondered sort of what the comfort level was as you look into Q4 and early next year, that you can hold price kind of firm-wide at least flat at 3M? And whether there's been any change how you sort of go to market to push price just given the experience of inflation in the last couple of years? Monish Patolawala : Yes, Julian, I would just say the same thing that I said with another question before. The way I would just say long term, 3M has always been able to add value to its customers, and that is reflected in the pricing that it charges. We look at this not based on just a formula, but we look at it market by market, look at our competitive position and market by market, look at the value we add, and that's how we come up with our pricing that we go with. And I would say, based on the innovation and the value that we add to our customers, long term, I don't see that changing. In the short run, as you have seen, the Company has been able to manage inflation through price. And if needed, we'll continue doing that. But overall, right now, the teams are quite focused on delivering the fourth quarter, and then we'll see where long term goes this topic. It will be a function of demand, a function of inflation. So that's the way I look at it. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just to focus on a couple of markets within Safety and Industrial, but I guess had been pretty strong and most of the sort of rhetoric is fairly strong around them. But organically, you had a little bit of pressure at least or less growth in and that's the electrical markets and also automotive aftermarket. So I just wondered any color around those in terms of is it just kind of accelerated destocking distributors just holding off on orders for some reason? Any color at all on auto aftermarket and electrical? Michael Roman : Yes, Julian, I wouldn't -- we saw a little bit of destocking in electrical markets. That was one of the areas in industrial that we saw that impacting. And I would say our automotive aftermarket probably saw a little bit of adjustments given what we talked about and Monish highlighted that, improving supply chains, distribution and the channel are managing their inventories, their safety stock, so more in line with stable supply chain. So I think that's part of it. Those have both been seeing good market performance as we've gone through the year. I think again, we're watching closely the trends as we go into the end of the year. But really, it's, I think, reflects on the -- a little bit of destocking and also the end market demand. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Michael Roman : To wrap up, we continue to execute our strategies, delivering results in a challenging environment while positioning 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets and geographies where 3M innovation can deliver the most impact. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 23, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. Please note, that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our 2024 outlook. This outlook will be provided on the same adjusted basis used during 2023. In the coming months, there are significant milestones that the company expects to complete, including the spin-off the Health Care business and the finalization of the public water supplier and combat arms legal settlements. The Health Care spend remains on-track for the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions as detailed in our SEC filings. We continue to expect the business to be spun-off with an estimated net leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA, and with the proceeds to be distributed to 3M prior to the completion of the spin. We are working through the processes, with all parties and the courts in both the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplugs legal settlements. Our goal is our finalization and ultimate implementation. Absent the proceeds from the intended spin-off of the Health Care business, the company has not concluded, how it would fund amounts due under the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplugs legal settlements. Therefore, we have not included the potential impacts of changes in net debt that may be needed to fund amounts under these agreements. For illustrative purposes only, in the absence of the proceeds from the spin, the adjusted earnings per share impact from financing legal settlements could be up to approximately a $0.20 per share headwind based on current market conditions. Also, please note that we will be treating the dilutive earnings impact of 3M's option to satisfy the $1 billion in payments related to the Combat Arms Earplug settlement with 3M's shares as an adjustment in arriving at results adjusted for special items. Finally, it is important to note that when considering 3M's financials post spin, it is not appropriate to simply remove the Health Care business financial results. There are other factors such as transition services agreements, stranded cost and below the line items that need to be taken into account. We are planning on holding an investor meeting later this year, following the spin of Health Care where we will provide an update to our full year 2024 guidance along with our medium-term financial framework. With that, please turn to Slide 4. And I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a strong fourth quarter as we continued to improve our operational performance, with adjusted EPS growth of 11%, operating margin expansion of 180 basis points and robust cash flow. Monish will cover more details of the quarter, but first, I would like to comment on our full year performance. Throughout 2023, we delivered on our commitments with results that exceeded our original earnings and cash flow guidance. While organic sales declined 3%, reflecting softness in certain end markets, including consumer retail and electronics, our disciplined execution supported year-over-year adjusted margin expansion. Excluding restructuring, we delivered increased margins of 60 basis points, helping drive earnings of $9.24 per share, along with a 30% increase in free cash flow and a conversion rate of 123%. Our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in the business, while reducing net debt by $2 billion or 17%, and returning $3.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend. Please turn to Slide 5. As you recall, in January of last year, we committed to take a deeper look at everything we do. Our success in 2023 reflects that commitment along with our execution of three strategic priorities, which are unlocking value for customers and shareholders, both today and into the future. Let me highlight key achievements in these areas, including how we will build on our progress in 2024. Starting with driving performance through the 3M model. In 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in 3M's history to streamline the organization, reduce costs at the center, and get us closer to our customers, which generated more than $400 million in savings during the year. These efforts included aggressively cutting management layers, reducing corporate shared services and modernizing our technology by removing hundreds of legacy systems. We reduced rooftops worldwide and took actions to help us address stranded costs, as we progress the Health Care spend. We simplified our supply chains and are doing more to leverage data and data analytics to visualize the flow of goods, so we can serve customers more efficiently. We optimized our global go-to-market models for each of our business groups. And consumer for example, we simplified our division structure with each of our global area teams now better aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and brands. At the same time, we have transitioned to an export-led model in approximately 30 smaller countries around the world, allowing us to reduce costs and complexity while still bringing 3M innovation to local customers. The simplification of our organization also frees up resources to prioritize exciting growth opportunities for 3M, such as automotive electrification, climate technology and industrial automation. While we have more work to do in 2024, our actions are helping us to improve our operational performance and create a more competitive 3M. Our next priority is the spin-off of Solventum, our Health Care business. Last year, we appointed experienced Health Care leaders to Solventum, including Bryan Hanson as CEO, Carrie Cox as Board Chair, and Wayde McMillan as CFO. The spin is on track to be completed in the first half of this year, and we are confident in the value it will create for customers, care providers, patients and shareholders. As we look to 2024, we will continue to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize geographies, markets and products, where we see the greatest opportunity. Finally, we are focused on addressing risk and uncertainty. The Combat Arms settlement we announced last August has received strong support from both claimants and the broader military community. We completed the first three milestones of the settlement as planned, including earlier this month, when we reached agreement with all plaintiffs, who were being prepared for trial. We will continue to work with all parties in the courts to fully implement the settlement. With respect to PFAS, our settlement with public water suppliers is on track for the final approval hearing scheduled for February 2nd. We will continue to address other PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions as appropriate. We also remain on schedule to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, with production volumes down 20%. Looking back, in a year full of change, I am pleased how 3Mers around the world stepped-up to lead. Importantly, we stayed relentlessly focused on doing what 3M does best, using material science to make a difference in the world. I see exciting examples of innovation across our company. Earlier this month, we unveiled the world's first solar powered communications headset, building on our decades of leadership in both personal safety and sustainability. We are advancing more durable, energy efficient and connected vehicles with an array of solutions, including new thermal barrier materials that improve the range and safety of electric car batteries, just one element of our automotive electrification program, which grew 30% in 2023, on top of 30% growth in 2022. Our Medical Solutions business, a world leader in advanced wound care, just announced a partnership with the U.S. Army, where we will collaborate with the military and leading universities to develop traumatic wound solutions. And in Consumer, last year, we launched more than a dozen new products, including new solutions for heavyweight hanging, part of our $0.5 billion Command franchise, which leverages our world-class adhesives technology. 3M's innovation engine is strong. It will remain the heart of our business and our ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers. In summary, the 3M team delivered a successful 2023, and I am confident we will accelerate our progress in the coming year. I will come back to talk about our 2024 priorities and guidance after Monish takes you through the details of the fourth quarter. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. The fourth quarter culminated a year where we took significant steps to improve our operational execution, resulting in better financial performance. We aggressively controlled spending and initiated restructuring actions to simplify our supply chains, reduce structure and streamline our go-to-market models to better serve customers. At the same time, we continue preparing for the successful spin of our Health Care business and work to reduce risks and uncertainties related to legal matters. While there is more to do, our teams made tremendous progress in 2023 that we build upon in 2024 and beyond. Looking at fourth quarter performance, adjusted sales were $7.7 billion at the high-end of our guidance. End markets continue to play out as anticipated. Notably, the auto OEM market remains strong in the fourth quarter and we saw signs of end market stabilization in consumer electronics. As expected, China and consumer retail end markets continue to be soft. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 1.4% versus last year. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirator negatively impacted organic growth by 60 basis points of $50 million. Excluding this impact, Q4 adjusted organic sales were down 80 basis points. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 180 basis points year-on-year or up 320 basis points excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted earnings were $2.42 up 11% year-on-year. Versus our guidance, fourth quarter earnings were benefited by $0.06 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate which was partially offset by the acceleration of restructuring actions which impacted earnings by approximately $0.03. And finally, fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion up 18% year-on-year. For the full year, we delivered $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow versus an originally expected range of $4.2 billion to $5 billion at the start of the year. Please turn to Slide 7 for a recap of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Benefits from manufacturing productivity, sourcing actions, restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices more than offset headwinds from lower sales volumes, investments in the business and last year's disposable respirator sales comparison. This net benefit drove a year-on-year expansion in Q4 operating margins of 400 basis points and earnings per share of $0.43 per share. Pre-tax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $109 million, or a negative impact to margins of 140 basis points and $0.17 to earnings. Raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation was a slight year-on-year headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins or minus $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share. Foreign currency translation was a negative 70 basis points impact to adjusted operating margins are negative $0.07 per share. This result was primarily due to the net impact of hedging and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. As previously mentioned, our adjusted tax rate was lower-than-expected coming in at 14.9%. This compared to 16.6% in last year's fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.05 benefit to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.01 per share year-on-year impact. Please turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year with conversion of 145%, up 800 basis points versus last year's Q4. Our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory, continues to yield results. Inventory was down $550 million year-on-year and is now at 14.8% of sales, a 90 basis points improvement year-on-year. I am pleased with the progress to-date and see significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $308 million, down 32% versus last year's abnormally high fourth quarter. For the year, we invested over $1.4 billion versus an expected range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And finally, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends during the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q4, stood at $10 billion, a decline of $2 billion year-on-year or 17%. 3M continues to be a reliable and robust cash generator. In addition, the upcoming spin-off our Health Care business will further strengthen our balance sheet. As Bruce mentioned, we anticipate receiving a 1x dividend from Solventum at an initial leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA. We will also retain a 19.9% equity stake, which will provide additional liquidity. This combined with our existing strong capital structure provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 3.9% organically. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirators was a headwind of approximately $50 million negatively impacting segment organic growth by 160 basis points. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in roofing granules, while industrial adhesives and tapes was flat, while all other businesses declined. Geographically, core industrial markets in the United States were relatively strong, while China remained weak. Our businesses were impacted by reduction in channel inventory towards the end of the quarter, particularly in the Greater China and EMEA regions, as channel partners manage cash and are cautious as we enter 2024. Adjusted operating income was $524 million, down 6% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower sales volumes which was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, pricing and strong spending discipline. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $1.8 billion or up 2.7% organically. Our auto OEM business continued to perform well and increased 13% versus a 9% increase in global car and light truck bills. The Electronics business was flat organically year-on-year as demand for consumer electronic devices began to stabilize, while semiconductor remains soft. We continue to closely monitor these trends and are well-positioned to grow with our customers in these large and important end markets. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials grew organically high single-digits, Commercial Solutions grew low-single-digits and Transportation Safety declined \u2013single-digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $370 million in adjusted operating income, up 28% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 380 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team achieved this result through restructuring actions, pricing and strong spending discipline. Turning to our Health Care business. Q4 sales were $2 billion or down 1% organically versus last year. Sales in our Medical Solutions business grew low-single-digits organically, while Separation and Purification and Oral Care were both down low-single-digits. Health Information Systems organic sales decreased high-single-digits. Looking at the year, our businesses within Health Care continued to see lingering COVID related impacts. Full year organic growth in Health Care was approximately 1% with both Medical Solutions and Oral Care posting positive low-single-digit growth, while Health Information Systems and Separation and Purification were both down low-single-digits. Health Care's fourth quarter operating income was $372 million down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 18.3% or down 1.9 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Year-on-year adjusted operating margins were impacted by lower sales volumes along with added costs associated with the pending spin. Lastly, the Consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year. Home improvement increased low-single-digits organically, while Home Health and Auto declined low-single-digits and Stationery and Office declined high-single-digits. Geographically, organic growth was down slightly in the U.S., while EMEA was down mid-single-digits and Asia Pacific declined low-double-digits. Consumer's fourth quarter operating income was $221 million, up 4% compared to last year. With operating margins of 18%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from restructuring actions, portfolio optimization, strong spending discipline and productivity actions. Before I turn it back to Mike for him to discuss outlook for 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our 2023 total company performance. As the year progressed, we made strong improvements in adjusted operating margins. For reference, Slide 23 in the appendix provides our quarterly adjusted operating margin recon for the year. As you can see, we delivered significant improvement in performance, particularly when setting aside the impact from restructuring charges. Please turn to Slide 12, and I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike? Mike Roman : Thank you, Monish. We are entering 2024 with strong momentum from our strategic priorities as we build on the actions taken in 2023. We will remain focused on improving operational performance as we progress our restructuring, while driving even greater supply chain productivity and inventory reductions. These represent significant opportunities to deliver sustainable margin and cash flow expansion in 2024. We will also further accelerate efforts to optimize our portfolio, which has been an ongoing strategy for 3M. In addition to finalizing the Health Care spin, we will continue implementing our geographic prioritization strategy. We will also step up our efforts to prioritize our product portfolios based on market potential, right to win, supply chain complexity, margins and returns. For example, in our Consumer business, we have identified approximately 5% of the portfolio where we have limited market growth and a poor right to win. While exiting these portfolios will impact consumers' growth rate in the near-term, these actions will better focus our efforts on products that best utilize 3M invention and ultimately drive improved growth and margins in the long-term. At the same time, 3M succeeds across market cycles because we remain close to customers and invest in innovation. We will continue to invest in R&D and capital expenditures, enabling us to win in our core and also in new attractive markets where 3M can make a difference. Finally, we will stay focused on reducing risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation, including finalizing legal settlements. We will advance the ramp down of PFAS manufacturing while continuing to make progress on our sustainability goals. In 2024, for example, we expect to complete the investments in state-of-the-art water filtration technology across our chemical manufacturing sites. Please turn to Slide 13. Based on these focus areas, along with the macroeconomic outlook, we are laying out our guidance for 2024. We expect the execution of our priorities to support the strengthening of our competitive position, continued underlying margin improvement and strong cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. As we start 2024, the macro environment remains muted, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, we anticipate organic full year growth of flat to plus 2%. Excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and portfolio actions, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3%. With respect to EPS, we anticipate earnings of $9.35 to $9.75 per share. We expect continued strong margin expansion, along with another year of strong cash flow with an adjusted conversion rate of 95% to 105%. As Bruce noted, following the completion of the Health Care spin, we will host an investor meeting and provide strategic updates along with updated guidance for 3M. As always, underpinning our success will be the strengths of 3M, our industry-leading material science, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and iconic brands, along with some of the best and brightest people around the world. Before I turn it back to Monish, let me repeat a few important points. As I look across 3M, a 2023 was a pivotal year for our enterprise. We executed our plans and delivered on our commitment to exit the year stronger, leaner and more focused. We improved our operational performance advance the spin-off of Solventum and address risk and uncertainty. I am proud of everything we accomplished in 2023, and equally excited about the year ahead. We are in excellent position to build on our progress, continue to improve our operational performance and deliver another successful year. I thank all 3Mers for their dedication and for everything they do for our company. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on our guidance. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thanks, Mike. Please turn to Slide 14. As Mike highlighted, we expect another year of strong execution on our priorities, including strengthening our competitive position, continued margin improvement and robust cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. Let's now look at our 2024 expected performance for our business segments. Starting with Safety and Industrial, where we estimate organic sales growth to be flat to up low-single-digits. As we start the year, we continue to see demand in industrial end markets remaining mixed. Full year 2024, industrial production forecast is currently expected to be at approximately 2% worldwide with the U.S. being flat. This business is not only impacted by general industrial manufacturing but also production activity in automotive and electronics end markets, which I will cover next with my comments on transportation and electronics. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be flat to up low-single-digits organically. This range excludes the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing. Consumer electronics end markets are expected to be up slightly year-on-year as the market works to turn the corner. The semiconductor market is forecasted to start the year soft, however, improve as we progress through the year. Automotive unit volume production is forecast to be down slightly year-on-year. Despite this forecast, we continue to see significant opportunities in the automotive sector through our offerings in both electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicles. Health Care's organic sales growth is anticipated to be flat to up low-single-digits year-on-year. Bryan and his team are excited to lead this great business and we'll be providing more details on 2024 and beyond, as we progress towards the spin. Turning to Consumer. Organic sales are expected to be down low-single-digits as discretionary spending is expected to remain muted, especially in the U.S., along with our ongoing portfolio optimization initiatives. As Mike mentioned, these actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind of approximately $100 million or 2 percentage points. As you create your models for 2024, I want to highlight some important items. We anticipate pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $350 million and incremental savings in the range of $150 million to $250 million. As I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary costs required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring. For example, this includes structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models, automate processes and continued investment in cybersecurity. Additionally, the restructuring actions have helped to partially reduce stranded costs associated with the pending spin of Health Care. Overall, our restructuring program remains on-track to deliver pretax savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million with a similar level of charges upon completion. We anticipate our actions will be largely done by the end of 2024, with benefits carrying into 2025. Moving to pension expense. We estimate a non-operating pension headwind of approximately $100 million in 2024 or a negative $0.15 per share. This headwind is primarily due to the updating of assumptions, including mortality, along with the amortization of prior period losses. While we will have an earnings headwind in 2024, it is important to note that our global plans are well funded, ending 2023 at 94%. Net interest expense is anticipated to be a small year-on-year benefit of approximately $0.03 per share. Again, this excludes the pending impact of the Health Care spin and legal settlements that Bruce mentioned at the start of the call. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for 2024. This compares to our adjusted tax rate of 17.5% in 2023, resulting in a year-on-year headwind of approximately $0.17 per share at the midpoint. Therefore, the net impact of these below-the-line items is forecasted to result in an earnings headwind of approximately $0.29 per share. This combined headwind is included in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings range guidance of $9.35 to $9.75 that Mike mentioned. Please turn to Slide 15. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly cover our thoughts on the first quarter. As we look at the first quarter, we see our adjusted sales being approximately $7.6 billion or down slightly versus last year. This forecast factors in an expectation for similar macroeconomic trends that we saw in Q4. It also includes an approximate $100 million year-on-year sales headwind from geographic prioritization and consumer portfolio initiatives, along with the impact of last year's disposable respirator comp. Turning to earnings. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share. This expectation reflects adjusted operating margins in the range of 19.5% to 20%. This range includes continued standup costs related to this pending spin of Health Care, along with over 100 basis points impact from restructuring and related charges. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins are forecasted to increase by over 250 basis points year-on-year. In the first quarter, non-op pension will be a $0.04 per share headwind to adjusted earnings. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter to be in the range of 20% to 21%. In closing, I would like to emphasize a few things. We remain focused on our priorities and the team continues to drive results through strong operational execution. Our decisive actions in 2023 set the foundation for a strong 2024. As you know, there are many important milestones in the coming months, including completing the spin of Health Care. And finally, as a reminder, if you are creating financial models for 3M post-spin, please keep in mind that simply removing the Health Care business from Total 3M financials will not equal 3M post-spin. There are other factors such as transition service agreements, stranded costs and below-the-line changes that need to be taken into account. As mentioned, once the spin is complete, we will hold an investor meeting and provide an update on our outlook for 2024 that incorporates these factors. In summary, we are building on our momentum and driving sustainable operating improvements that will drive improved financial performance. I want to thank the 3M team for their dedication and focus, as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Mike and Monish, could you give us a little more color into the consumer and industrial channels that you deal with? I know you said you're seeing signs of consumer electronics improvement, but also mentioned the destock in China, for instance, at the end of Q4. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing across the consumer and industrial channels. And then you are modeling Q1 sales, I think, to be sequentially flat, excluding the $100 million of sales headwind you called out, which seems conservative if your early cycle business starting to turn. So what are you seeing? Mike Roman : Yes, Andy, I'd start with Q1 looks to us a lot like Q4. So some of the dynamics that you're asking about are part of that. We talked about electronics stabilizing in Q4. So starting year-over-year comparison and stabilizing against that. As we look forward, consumer retail, similar as well. We saw still softness in discretionary product categories, discretionary purchases. Consumer spending has been strong, but it's been shifting all through the year, as you know, to experiences, services and even food as inflation has impacted that. So we see that dynamic continuing to play out as we look forward. If you look at the channel, I'd say broadly, the channels are stabilizing. Consumer, there was -- as we went through the first part of last year, there was aggressive reduction in inventory in the channel. That played out and it's more balanced as we come through fourth quarter as we look into Q1. There was some cautious at the end of '23. At the end of the fourth quarter, we saw some caution in the channel in China and consumer. But I think they're fairly well balanced at this point. The one area where we continue to note some adjustments is in the industrial channels, and that's as supply chains continue to perform better, they're reducing their safety stock. And that's been a steady. I think there's a little bit of caution as we go into the New Year in areas like Europe, Middle East, Africa, there's a caution about demand. China, as I already said. So -- but I think generally broader, I would characterize it as more stable and in line with what the expectations are. Monish Patolawala : I just would add, Andy, to Mike's comments that auto builds are expected to be down 10% sequentially. And then historically, if you just look at a couple of our businesses is Consumer and Health Care, they seasonally do come down Q4 to Q1. So we baked all that into the guide that we've given of approximately $7.6 billion. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, guys. And then, Monish, could you give us a little more color in terms of what's happening with your restructuring program? You pretty much were matching benefits to cost in '23. And as you said, you even pulled forward a few pennies of restructuring versus your expectations in Q4. For '24, I think you're modeling now $100 million difference in terms of higher restructuring costs versus benefits. So maybe give us more color into why you can't get that sort of one-to-one faster return on your '24 actions? Monish Patolawala : No, I think -- Andy, let me explain that first. I'll just go all the way to the top again on our benefits and then I explain the math to you. So for everyone's benefit, in 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in our history that generated $400 million in savings last year and approximately the same amount in costs. But when you look at the overall program, it remains on track to achieve the annual run rates of $700 million to $900 million upon completion. And assuming a no-spin scenario of Health Care, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect nearly 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement to be realized upon completion of the whole program. And the program, as you said, Andy, remains on track. We've said that it remains on track, and we did pull in or accelerated some of our restructuring into 2023 based on the success that we have had in the program. What I would tell you to answer your question specifically is what I've said is the $150 million to $250 million is incremental benefit. So on a cumulative basis, if you did $400 million in 2023, and you say midpoint of $150 million to $200 million, that's cumulative $600 million. So on a year-over-year, that's incremental $200 million. While on a cost basis, we said we incurred $400 million and change in the fourth quarter, I think, it\u2019s $441 million. And I said we'll have $250 million to $350 million of cost. So on a cumulative basis, the cost will be around $750 million again at the midpoint. As I've also said in my prepared remarks, we believe this program will be largely completed by the end of 2024 from an expense perspective and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond. I just want to make sure 1 other thing, and we think about restructuring, I just want us to also think through this is -- and I want you all to know, this is how we work. And this is not a series of one-time actions. And I know a lot of investors have asked us, show us the break between benefits and costs. So we are definitely trying to do that the best we can. In 2023, it made all the sense because these were new actions, it was good to show it as individual. But as it becomes the way we work, my request to all of you is focus on the total margin of the company, which is demonstrated in 2024, where our guide is saying we'll improve margins, another 75 to 100 basis points in total. So, for example, and the reason I bring this up is you have to look at all of this in totality. For example, we announced that we were going to change our distribution model in 27 countries. The savings of the rooftops, the head count is shown as a benefit in our restructuring program. But as you all know, there's a corresponding impact on the revenue, and the action has to be looked at in totality versus standalone events. And I just want to make sure we bring that out, too. But we'll continue showing what it helps you all, and that's what we have tried to do with this go-round. So hopefully, I cleared that question, Andy, that you had. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Guys, can you help us understand the ebb and flow when you go to an export model for 30 countries and -- maybe help us understand the materiality of that, it could be 30 really small countries, could be a mix, I don't know. But if you think about kind of the revenue headwind versus the cost tailwind, is it -- is there some numbers we can talk around or any perhaps even some color on how that ebbs and flows? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So Scott, the total impact of geographic prioritization and portfolio actions that Mike mentioned is around 100 basis points for the company. Of that, 60% is product portfolio optimization. The balance is geographic prioritization. And overall, when you look at the margin rate in these smaller countries, they were at lower margins than the average for 3M. So that's when you refocus, what happens is, since you're going through a distributor, you basically have to drop price to some extent because now they're picking up your cost. And so that's why you see the revenue headwind. But on a margin rate perspective, this is beneficial for us to do. It helps us focus on the bigger countries. It also allows us to reinvest in those bigger countries, while at the same time, making sure that in the smaller countries where we are changing the model, we can continue to serve those customers well with what we would call internally as an export-led model, which is we're going to ship our product out from the United States or wherever our end manufacturing is into those countries. So we are still taking care of the customers. We're just following a more efficient way to transact with those customers. So hopefully, that answers, Scott. Scott Davis : I think it does. And just separately, working capital has been a real source of benefit for you folks and particularly in '23. But are we -- as an entity, are you learning to run at lower working capital levels? And more specifically, really, what I'm talking about is inventory. And I think historically just having covered you guys for a while, inventory levels kind of went up and down based on demand, you're not expecting much demand in '24. So explicitly, I suppose that means you can run at lower inventory levels. But if demand were to start to snap back at better levels than you're expecting, would you still be able to run at relatively low inventory levels? Have there been enough structural change, I guess, is what I'm asking to 3M where you can run more productively and efficiently from a working capital perspective? Monish Patolawala : I would say so, Scott, as the team has done, Peter and the supply chain team have done a great job. One is learning through the pandemic on how do you manage the ebbs and flows as you go through supply chain disruptions. Two is we have spent a lot of time and energy investing in digital resources that allow us to more efficiently look at demand plans, look at where our inventory is and we have continued to keep working on dual sourcing, et cetera, that helps us get alternate sources of supply whenever you could have a disruption in one place. My view is this inventory still has ways to run using data and data analytics. We can keep reducing inventory. Working capital is going to continue to be a source of 3M's cash generation machine, along with a good EBITDA that we generate. And at the same time, I would tell you that volume -- if you see volume come back up, the factories are ready and we have the capacity and we'll act accordingly. So I would say the team has done a really nice job, but there's always more we can do and we'll keep doing. Mike Roman : Scott, just to add, the actions that we have been talking about all through '23, the actions to streamline our supply chain operations, simplify our go-to-market model, that streamlining supply chain operations. It was more than a restructuring. This was about aligning our global supply chains to our go-to-market models, really optimizing what we do across plan, source, make, deliver, with a focus on -- and an expectation that we're going to drive improvements, improvements in service, improvements in costs, improvements in working capital and cash. Monish said earlier, it's the actions we've taken about the way we operate, and it's an expectation we're going to continue to improve our execution. So there's a plan and strategy in data and data analytics gives us a basis for driving better visibility and improvement as well. So it's a -- it is part of that. So we do expect to continue to drive improvement as we our guide for '24 has us, again, driving improvements in how we execute showing up in growth in earnings and expanded margins and another year of strong cash generation. So it's a -- it is an important part of that -- those actions that we took as we went through '23. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe first off, I just wanted to clarify some of Monish's comments on operating margins year-on-year. So I think Monish, you were saying that in Q1, the margin is up 250 bps, excluding restructuring. And then the full year is up 75 to 100 bps including restructure. I just want to make sure if those numbers were right. Monish Patolawala : You're right. You're right. Julian Mitchell : Any color on sort of segments within that or the corporate cost, there was some reallocation you talked about on Slide 7? Any kind of major moving parts that you'd call out year-on-year on a segment basis or what that new sort of corporate run rate is? Monish Patolawala : Yes. I would say, Julian, as with prior years, there are a number of miscellaneous items in corporate and unallocated that are always subject to a fluctuation on a quarterly annual basis. So if you look at 2023, our input cost was $44 million. And in the fourth quarter, it was a $120 million benefit. The Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that we allocated the businesses finally based on performance. This adjustment had no impact to total company margins. So it's just a bucket swap between corporate unallocated and the businesses. And so for the full year of 2024, again, based on Health Care, being a part of 3M for the whole year. So it's just the assumption, we expect the expense range of paying somewhere in the $100 million to the $200 million on an adjusted basis for corporate unallocated. Julian Mitchell : And then just my second question, just trying to understand the free cash flow guidance because I think you did $6.3 billion of free cash in 2023. And this year is guided at about $5.3 billion. So it's a big decline year-on-year even with net income, I think, growing $200 million in the guide and CapEx is up about $100 million in the guide. Anything to sort of call out on that? Monish Patolawala : I would just say, Julian, 3M has historically always been a good cash generator. And that's what we plan to continue doing. If you look at 2022, we had 86% of free cash flow conversion, which we were not happy with at all. And the teams have done a great job in 2023 to get us back. If you take the two years, it's around 100%. And if you look at the history of 3M, we have always been in that range. And I would say we'll continue doing that. But at the same time, we'll keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability as and when the volume comes up as and when the opportunities arise because at the end of the day, our first priority is organic growth because that gives us the best return. And the best way to do that is organic investment. So that's our first priority. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Great [Indiscernible] by the way. So I just want to dig into the corporate line again, Monish. I think you said $100 million to $200 million kind of a run rate for 2024. That's EBIT, not EBITDA. I just want to make sure that's the case. And are you reflecting any corporate dissynergies or stand-alone cost for Health Care within that $100 million to $200 million? Monish Patolawala : It's EBIT. It's EBIT, Nigel, so that -- can you hear me? Nigel Coe : Yes, I can hear. Yes. Monish Patolawala : I'm sorry, what was your follow-up question? I didn't catch the... Nigel Coe : Yes. The kind of -- the second part of that question was were -- are you reflecting any stand-alone costs or stand-alone costs or corporate synergies from the Health Care spend within that number? Or would that be additive to that range? Monish Patolawala : No. That number, again, if you just go back to Bruce's comment at the beginning of the call, our current assumption is that Health Care is a part of 3M, even though the spin is on-track for first half 2024. And as we go through the spin of Health Care, we plan to have an Investor Day post-spin, where we'll update you on the stranded cost, the impact of transition services agreements as well as what 3M looks post-spin. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. Nigel, just to highlight, Monish during his prepared remarks, did mention that there is additional cost in Health Care for standing it up as a stand-alone entity. So that is having some margin impact within Health Care. Nigel Coe : No question. I just want to make sure that was the case. And then my follow-up question is just really trying to dig into the restructuring cadence. You obviously -- you quantified the Q1 impact, but take the $152 million of cost savings in Q4, Monish, and then multiply that 4. You get to mathematically about $650 million of cost savings. And the midpoint of your guide for 2024 is $617 million. So I'm just actually wondering, it doesn't look like we're getting any incremental costs coming through from here on in 2024. So just wondering what is the offset to that? Is there some level of investment here? Just wondering what's going on here? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I would say it's the same thing I've said before. If you remember, we have said our total benefits of $700 million to $900 million, once the program is done with equal costs. We are saying though, our actions will be largely done at the end of 2024. So you will see benefits continuing into 2025. And as I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary investments required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring programs. So for example, -- these investments include structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models. As we talked about, we have exited or changed the distribution model for 27 to 30 countries. So making sure we have a structure that supports that change, continuing to automate our back-end processes as we continue with the spin of Health Care upgrade rooftops as we consolidate space because you see the savings as we have exited the space, but I got to make sure that the rooftops upgraded so people can come into work there and then continued investment in cybersecurity. And we have also said this before that the restructuring actions that we have taken, one, it's a way of how we work, but two, it will help us partially reduce the stranded costs associated with the pending spin of Health Care. So all put together, I still see the programs on-track at $700 million to $900 million. But as I mentioned before, too, I would just ask you all to think through, there's a side of cost cadence, which once we are done with those actions, those cost cadence will go away and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond at an annualized basis of $700 million, $900 million, assuming Health Care remains as a part of 3M. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Christopher Snyder : I also wanted to ask on 2024 margins. And if we look through the restructuring, it seems like the guide is implying flat margins year-on-year from the business. And I guess, why isn't there expected margin expansion because the company is expecting to grow volumes or at least grow organically in the year. And it sounds like some of the exits the company is making should be accretive for margins of the underlying business. Just what are some of the headwinds there? Monish Patolawala : So I would say exactly the same thing I said before. When you look at it in total, our plan for 2024 assumes a margin expansion of 75 to 100 basis points, which includes a piece -- which includes the restructuring benefits and the lower restructuring costs. But at the same time, it also includes many other factors that we take into. For example, we're going to continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability as the macro starts improving. We're going to continue to invest in product areas. We're going to continue to invest in our people. So I would again ask you to look at in total, if you exclude restructuring costs in 2023, we expanded margins 60 basis points. And in 2024, our total margin expansion, including the benefits of restructuring is 75 to 100 basis points. So Chris, I would say as the year progresses, and I've said this before, volume gives us the best leverage. So as we get more volume, we're going to continue to see leverage increase. Christopher Snyder : I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the margins. I know you guys said $150 million to $250 million year-on-year net restructuring for the full year. But could you tell us what is implied in the Q1 guidance? And then also, I believe you said that the margin -- the Q1 margin includes some level of standing up cost for Health Care. Could you just tell us what those are expected to come in at? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So the benefits, I would say, again, it depends on which way you're looking at it, Chris. I would tell you, on a year-over-year basis, as I said, there's approximately 75 to 100 basis points -- sorry, $75 million to $100 million of restructuring cost on a year-over-year basis. So if you exclude that margin rates are 19.5% to 20% for Q1. No, sorry, 19.5% -- my number is all getting. It's 19.5% to 20% is the guide, which includes $75 million to $100 million of cost. So if you adjust for that cost on a year-over-year basis, margin rates will be up 250 to 300 basis points. And then on standup costs, again, timing will determine what the final standup cost is. But currently, we see approximately $0.07 to $0.08 of total cost that we are incurring, as Bryan and the team get ready for spin of Health Care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Good morning, everyone. Just -- so obviously, like the volume environment remains fairly muted. But I'm curious like how are you guys thinking about pricing for '24 and particularly like what's embedded in the guide from a price cost standpoint? Monish Patolawala : So 2024 outlook assumes we will have selling prices year-on-year. It's helping us offset some of the moderate inflation we are seeing in certain raw materials, and then the labor market continues to remain strong. But I would just tell you, you have seen we've become good at monitoring this. We'll make sure we continue to take actions as needed. And you've seen it, we've done that in '22. We have done that in 2023. But I would say, more importantly, when you think about margin rate, and the supply chain teams and the business teams, we are not just taking price raw as one item. In total, we are just saying how do we improve margins. So a lot of actions has been taken on, whether it's through selling price increases, driving global sourcing benefits, dual sourcing, driving yield in the factories and of course, prioritizing demand. And all of that put together, including the new way we work with all the restructuring-related items we have announced last year just help us continue to drive margin between 2024, '25 and beyond. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's clear, Monish. I guess there's been a lot of discussion on the restructuring expenses and the benefits coming through in the next couple of years. I guess just for 2025, as we're thinking about the low-end versus the high-end of the benefits range. Maybe like how would you kind of handicap what are the key drivers that potentially puts you guys at the low-end of the in versus the high-end of the $900 million benefit range? Monish Patolawala : So I would first say, number one, again, I keep reiterating this just because there's an assumption that's out there that we have assumed that Health Care remains as a part of 3M. That's just the guide but Health Care is on track for a first half '24 spin. Keeping that in mind, when you think about $700 million to $900 million, it's driven by two pieces. One is the pace at which we can execute some of these actions as well as some of the rooftop consolidations that we are working on. In total, I still feel good that the range of $700 million to $900 million is good for the overall program. But as you have seen, Joe, quarter-to-quarter, there's always going to be a little movement because there are multiple actions that we're working through regulations in countries and we're working through making sure we are doing it in a safe manner that you could have a month or two delay. But overall, I still feel good $700 million to $900 million is a good range. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa : I'm still not 100% clear what the sequential decline is in EPS from 4Q to 1Q. Can you maybe just help bridge that a little more specifically? I know there's tax impact there, maybe a little bit of sequential sales decline. I'm just having a little bit of a hard time reconciling the walks. I mean I think you had a $0.07 charge in Forex from Argentine devaluation, maybe that's a factor. I don't know, just maybe a little more color on the sequential EPS bridge from 4Q to 1Q. Monish Patolawala : Sure. And Steve, as I said, as you start lapping quarters and the benefits of restructuring starts showing up in the results, it's going to get harder and harder to do sequentials. But anyway, I'll do my best, and hopefully, that answers your question. So I would start by first saying you're going to see another strong quarter of execution on a year-over-year basis, and I would ask you to look at that first. When you look at our guide for January, we're saying it's approximately $7.6 billion. And there are no surprises in January so far. It's very similar to Q4 trends. So volume is a little lower Q4 to Q1. That has an impact. Secondly, there is usual seasonality that we see in our business when it comes to resetting some of our pay plans and some of the other compensation things that we do. So seasonally, you see that as an impact. Third is, as I mentioned earlier, we are incurring incremental costs to stand up the Health Care business as we get ready for the spin. The total impact is approximately $0.07 to $0.08 is the total impact of the -- it's the total cost in the quarter. We have a headwind from our pension accounting that we talked about, which is $0.04 of headwind. And then from a tax rate basis, we expect our 1Q tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% versus we ended the fourth quarter at 14.9%. So I hope that kind of gives you all the puts and takes to get you to the range that we have of $2 to $2.15. Stephen Tusa : Yes, that makes sense. And then just one last thing on restructuring. I mean, I don't -- I usually think of restructuring as building once you do a certain number in a quarter, you kind of carry it over annually, you guys are run rating at a pretty high level of benefits in the third and the fourth quarter that ramped pretty hard sequentially from the first half. Is there any like seasonality to these cost saves? Or I'm just curious as to why they're not maybe carrying over a little more into the first half of '24, like of a compounding of those benefits, if you will. I can understand the expense numbers are very clear, but it seems like you're kind of under punching the benefits based on that carryover in '24, especially in the first half. Monish Patolawala : I'm not sure I -- one would agree with that. But when you look at 1Q of '23 versus 1Q of '24. There was no restructuring benefits pretty much in 1Q of '23, and we had a little bit of cost in '23. So if you look at 1Q versus 1Q, you actually see margin rates up 250 basis points, excluding the impact of restructuring costs. So you are seeing the benefits, Steve, on a year-over-year basis in 1Q. For the year, as we have previously mentioned, our savings that we are showing you in the $700 million, $900 million, which it always has been, are net of the necessary investments that we are required to provide, which we are going to spend to provide sustained benefits. So again, just to repeat, things like, we changed our method of delivery in certain geographies, 30 countries. You need a structure that has to get put into place to serve that. You've got rooftops. So we have exited the rooftops, you're starting to see the savings, but we have to spend the money to upgrade the rooftops that we are left because we have to consolidate that space so that people can come and work in that space. And then we'll continue to invest in things like, customer operations and automate customer operations, which was a part of the whole -- there was a reason why we did this. Mike said it, I've said it, it's the way we work and some of the savings you're seeing come ahead as you've made those actions. And now we're going to put it -- we're going to put in the necessary costs so that we can continue to see those savings. And that's why I keep saying at the end of 2024, we'll be largely done with these actions and the benefits will carry on into '25 and beyond at $700 million to $900 million. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. Just so it's clear, Steve, the investments that Monish is highlighting is included. Monish Patolawala : In the $700 million. Bruce Jermeland : In the $700 million, $900 million. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Okay. That all makes sense. So it's kind of a bit of a timing thing. Bruce Jermeland : Correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back just to thinking about kind of the separation and just some of the math. Monish, you have taken some pains here to kind of remind us that it's not as simple as just splitting this in two. So just a couple of questions. I think you had previously said that just kind of stand-alone corporate costs for the Health Care business was about $100 million. I wonder if that's moving around at all if you could provide any additional color on that? And is there some color you could provide on what you're expecting on the TSAs think that's going to have to be an input to what the EBITDA is for Health Care at the time of the spin and the associated dividend that comes off that. So I know when to get the 4 and 10s to get a little bit closer. You're going to be more precise on this, but it does seem like you're directionally warning us to be prepared for some friction here. So I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color. Monish Patolawala : Yes, Jeff, as we said, I think the timing of the spin will definitely determine some of these costs. And I would just say let us work through it. As we get closer to it, Bryan and the team will walk you through as they get closer to getting ready for the spin. And as committed, we are going to have an Investor Day post-spin while we'll walk you through all the factors that you have to take into account, which is not only post 3M, what does that revenue and margin look like, but also the impact of transition services agreements because they will be transition services agreements for a period of time and then the amount of stranded costs. The good news, Jeff, is that through all the restructuring actions that we have done, to some extent, we have been able to reduce the amount of standard cost that would have been there if we hadn't taken these actions to reduce some of the cost at the center. Jeffrey Sprague : And then unrelated, just on Slide 3. Have you definitively decided to use the $1 billion equity option to fund part of Combat Arms? Monish Patolawala : Have we decided, I'm sorry? Jeffrey Sprague : Have you decided to go ahead and use the equity option of $1 billion for the Combat Arms? Monish Patolawala : No, we have not, Jeff. That's an option we hold, and we will make the appropriate decision once -- we see the progress in the number of opt-ins for the Combat Arms litigation. Bruce Jermeland : Yes, Jeff, the purpose of our statement is, so you guys can think about your outstanding share count that if we do exercise that option to pay in equity that, that will be treated as an excludes item in arriving at adjusted results. So that was only just to highlight, don't worry about the impact it is at our option. That is yet to be determined, but you don't have to take that into account relative to your share count on an adjusted basis. Jeffrey Sprague : But it sounds like you then will be planning to use an adjusted share count if you go down this path, right? So we're kind of compounding adjustments on top of adjustments, it sounds like. Bruce Jermeland : There would be a difference in GAAP shares outstanding versus adjusted shares outstanding if we decide to exercise this option to issue equity. Yes, we'll make it clear in our financial reporting if that were to incur. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Just had a couple of questions on some of the outliers in the fourth quarter results. And hopefully, I didn't miss this -- for transportation, electronics, significant upside on the top line. I saw that you have an adjusted flat organic revenue growth. So what were those adjustments that were to the good -- and then on the corporate line, and it's one, two a significant benefit -- just give us a sense of what those adjustments were that would have caused that? And maybe you answered that question with Julian, but I just wanted to get those clarified, please. Mike Roman : Yes, Deane, I think what you're looking at is the adjustment for PFAS, the exit of PFAS. If you recall, we're excluding the PFAS related men -- the PFAS manufacturing and related business as we report. And that was part -- the primary business for that was transportation and electronics. So that's where you saw that, maybe that adjustment. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And how about the corporate line? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So as with previous years, Deane, there are a number of miscellaneous items at corporate and unallocated that are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. So if you answer specifically your question, if you look at for the year, corporate and unallocated was $44 million and on a -- and in the fourth quarter, it was a benefit of $121 million. The Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that has now been allocated back to the business segments based on final performance. This adjustment had no impact to total company margins because it's a move from corporate and unallocated to the business segment. And then for the full year 2024, we expect the expense range to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million on an adjusted basis. Deane Dray : Great. I appreciate that. And just one last follow-up for me, Mike. You talked about the goals for '24 related to PFAS to advance the ramp down. Would there -- from what you see today, would there be any circumstances where 3M would continue to produce PFAS after 2025? Or is this just a non-negotiable? And will you dismantle the equipment? Or can it be repurposed? Mike Roman : Yes, Deane, we're committed to that what we announced to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. And as I said, we're making good progress to that. We're working to help customers transition. We will -- I think we talked about this on one of our earnings calls, we will not sell the equipment, we won't transfer any of the assets. We won't sell the business. We won't license our intellectual property. So we are going to exit and complete by the end of 2025. That's everybody's focused on that goal. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Mike Roman : To wrap up, we are executing our priorities and delivering on our commitments. We will stay focused on continuing to improve our performance, optimize our portfolio and reduce risk, while using 3M science to create unique solutions for our customers. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 30, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our total company Q1 2024 results, which are inclusive of the Health Care business and are on the same basis on which 3M provided first quarter guidance back in January. As we have mentioned, it is important to note that Solventum Corporation's separate financial reporting will differ from the basis of presentation used by 3M for the Health Care segment. 3M's full year 2024 earnings guidance initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting Solventum as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we will be treating changes in the value of our 19.9% equity interest in Solventum as a special item in arriving at non-GAAP results adjusted for special items. And finally, we are providing additional financial information this quarter in our press release and slide presentation given the impact of the Solventum spin. We hope that you find the information useful in understanding our Q1 performance and outlook for 2024. We also plan on filing additional information on a continuing operations basis, including in late July or early August, Form 8-Ks with recast 2023, Form 10-K and Q1 2024 Form 10-Q information. Please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our updated post-spin financial reporting framework. Beginning with the second quarter, Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer business segment operating income will include the impact of the dis-synergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. In addition, we have added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement costs, which 3M will be reimbursed for beginning here in April. Finally, Corporate and Unallocated will incorporate the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1. One final comment. In the appendix on Slide 27, you will find information on our Public Water Suppliers and Combat Arms legal settlements, including the pretax payment schedule by year and total combined pretax present value and after-tax estimates. With that, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results that were better than our expectations as we returned to adjusted organic growth and achieved double-digit adjusted earnings growth. We improved performance across our businesses and in our operational execution. We also completed the spin-off of Solventum and finalized 2 major legal settlements. Our results demonstrate the positive impact of the changes we have made over the last several years. We've also made significant progress in executing our strategic priorities, which has positioned the company for long-term shareholder value creation. In the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, including improved organic growth, operating margins of 22%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21%. On April 1, we successfully completed the spin-off of our Health Care business, Solventum, creating 2 world-class companies well positioned to deliver greater shareholder returns through distinct and compelling investment profiles. As independent companies, both 3M and Solventum are better able to tailor their capital allocation and investment priorities to win in their respective markets. I want to thank and congratulate the teams whose dedication made this major accomplishment possible and wish the entire Solventum team, led by CEO, Bryan Hanson, great success in the future. In Q1, we also finalized 2 major legal settlements. First, our settlement agreement with U.S.-based Public Water Suppliers received widespread support and participation. It was granted final approval by the court on March 29. We anticipate making total payments with a pretax present value of up to $10.3 billion over the next 13 years. The first payment is expected in the third quarter of 2024. It is important to note our agreement with Public Water Suppliers addresses the detection of any type of PFAS at any level. This includes PFAS that have already been detected or may be detected in the future, including those that are the subject of the U.S. EPA's recently announced limits in drinking water. Second is our settlement of the Combat Arms multi-district litigation. As of today, more than 99% of claimants have chosen to participate. This provides us the certainty and finality the settlement was intended to achieve. We anticipate making total payments up to a pretax present value of $5.3 billion through 2029. We also continue to make good progress on our exit of all PFAS manufacturing. We are on track to meet our commitment by the end of 2025 and are working closely with each of our customers to complete an orderly transition. In summary, the progress across all 3 of our strategic priorities has helped make 3M stronger, leaner and more focused on what we do best : utilize 3M science to make indispensable products for our customers. I will now turn the call over to Monish for more details regarding our performance in Q1 and to discuss our guidance for 2024. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. We continue to build upon the strong foundation we laid in 2023. We remain focused on our priorities, and the team continues to deliver improving results. We posted strong adjusted results in the quarter, including sales of $7.7 billion, operating margin of 21.9%, earnings per share of $2.39 and free cash flow of over $800 million. These results were better than our expectations as we continue to drive strong operational execution and spending discipline. We also benefited from significant operating leverage, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, which was driven by strong organic volume growth in electronics and automotive. Our results also benefited from the acceleration of certain nonrecurring actions, which I will go through in more detail on the next slide. Our first quarter adjusted sales of $7.7 billion exceeded our expectations of $7.6 billion as we delivered improved organic growth, which was partially offset by a headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered adjusted organic growth of nearly 1% or up 2.4% excluding geographic prioritization, product portfolio initiatives and last year's disposable respirator comp. Organic growth was driven by our Transportation and Electronics business as the team won share gains from spec-in wins and new product introductions with automotive and consumer electronics OEMs. This drove strong organic growth as the OEMs ramp production for new launches for end customers. Geographically, year-on-year strength in China and EMEA was driven by our strength in electronics and automotive. Sales in the U.S. were flat year-on-year with industrial and health care end markets showing relative strength, offset by consumer retail softness. Please turn to Slide 7 for details of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. As mentioned, on an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.9%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21% versus last year's first quarter. Our first quarter performance was driven by improved organic growth, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, along with a continued focus on operations, restructuring actions and spending discipline, which drove better-than-expected improvements in operating margins of 340 basis points and earnings of $0.42 per share. As disclosed in our Form 10-K and as factored into our 1Q guidance that we provided in January, our year-on-year margins and earnings were benefited from the delay of our stock-based compensation grants from a normal timing in the first quarter to the second quarter due to the Solventum spin. This timing adjustment added 140 basis points to margins and $0.15 to earnings per share as compared to last year's first quarter. We also accelerated certain nonrecurring benefits, including property sales as we progress on our asset-light strategy. This benefited first quarter year-on-year operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and earnings by $0.08 per share. We accelerated restructuring actions in the quarter, incurring pretax charges of $122 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million to $100 million. This compared to last year's restructuring charge of $52 million, resulting in a negative year-on-year impact to margins of 90 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. Foreign currency negatively impacted adjusted margins by 60 basis points or a negative $0.09 per share as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. This headwind was larger than we had expected. The reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies in Q2 2023 resulted in a $0.01 benefit year-on-year to earnings per share and was neutral to margins. As expected, our adjusted tax rate was 20.5% this year, which was higher than when compared to 17.7% in last year's first quarter, resulting in a $0.09 headwind to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.04 per share year-on-year impact. This benefit was primarily driven by interest income on proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in debt prior to the separation, partially offset by a non-op pension headwind. Please turn to Slide 8. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was over $800 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 63%, in line with our historical first quarter trends. We continue to focus on driving working capital efficiency, including improved cash conversion cycle times. I am pleased with the progress we have made, yet there remains significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $355 million in the quarter, down 20% year-on-year. The lower year-on-year spend is primarily due to nearing completion on water filtration investments at our manufacturing facilities. And finally, we returned $835 million to shareholders via dividends. Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $10.4 billion, a decline of 13% year-on-year, driven by strong free cash flow generation of our businesses. Also of note, in late February, Solventum issued debt of $8.4 billion for which the repayment obligation went with Solventum, while 3M kept approximately $7.7 billion in proceeds upon spin on April 1. These proceeds, combined with our business' strong and reliable cash generation, have further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, the retained 19.9% equity stake in Solventum will provide additional future liquidity. Also, during the quarter, we retired $2.9 billion of debt. Our strong capital structure and robust cash generation provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance, starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 1.4% organically. Industrial end-market demand remained mixed in the quarter. We delivered strong double-digit growth in roofing granules, driven by replacement demand and storm repair. Industrial Adhesives and Tapes posted low single-digit organic growth, driven by spec-in wins in new bonding solutions for consumer electronics devices. The Personal Safety business declined low single digits as strong demand for self-contained breathing apparatus for the first responder market was more than offset by year-on-year comp headwind from disposable respirators. And finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in electrical markets, abrasives, automotive aftermarket and industrial specialties. Geographically, industrial markets in the United States were up 1%, while China remained challenged. Adjusted operating income was $664 million, up 18% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 24.3%, up 410 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by benefits from ongoing productivity actions, timing of stock-based compensation and strong spending discipline. These benefits more than offset headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 11, which posted adjusted sales of $1.8 billion or up 6.7% organically. Consumer electronics end markets were stable in the quarter, while the semiconductor market remains soft. Our electronics business outperformed the market, up mid-teens organically year-on-year. The introduction of new products continues to be well received in the market, as evidenced by recent spec-in wins. In addition, we also experienced continued channel inventory normalization as electronics demand stabilizes. Our auto OEM business increased 13% in Q1 versus a 1% decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to win increased penetration, including strong momentum in automotive electrification, which was up over 30% year-on-year in Q1. We also saw an increase in channel inventory at tier suppliers during the quarter given the forecasted 8% sequential increase in the auto OEM builds from Q1 to Q2. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, commercial branding and transportation grew low single digits organically, and advanced materials was flat year-on-year. While our Transportation and Electronics business is off to a good start to the year, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of the strong first quarter organic growth was driven by initial buy ahead by customers as they ramp production and introduce new products, along with channel inventory normalization. Transportation and Electronics delivered $479 million in adjusted operating income, up 68% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 960 basis points versus Q1 last year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on improved electronics volumes, ongoing productivity actions, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from restructuring costs. Turning to Slide 12. The Consumer business posted first quarter sales of $1.1 billion. Organic sales declined 3.9% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending, which included a 2.4 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home Improvement and Consumer Safety and Well-Being declined low single digits. And Home and Auto care declined mid-single digits, while Packaging and Expression declined high single digits organically. We continue to invest in the business, including supporting successful new product launches, such as Command Heavyweight hanging products and sustainably focused Scotch-Brite cleaning tools and Scotch Home and Office tapes. Organic growth declined across all geographies. The U.S. was down low single digits, Asia Pacific mid-single digits and EMEA high single digits. Consumer's first quarter operating income was $216 million, up 21% compared to last year with operating margins of 19%, up 400 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from productivity actions, portfolio initiatives, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs. Finally, included in the appendix is a slide in the first quarter performance for Health Care. The business delivered results within our expectations with organic growth of 1% and operating margins of 17.5%. Now turning to guidance for the year on Slide 14. As Bruce mentioned at the beginning of the call, our full year 2024 outlook initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting Health Care as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter. We have confidence in the momentum we have built throughout 2023. We continue to deliver strong results, including the first quarter, which was better than expectations. The guidance initiated today represents a return to growth, adjusted margins up 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year versus the illustrative midpoint of 18.7% for 2023 and over 15% earnings per share growth at the midpoint. We anticipate full year adjusted organic growth of flat to up 2% or up 1% to 3% excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives we are taking. This estimated organic growth rate incorporates full year external forecast for major end markets, including an expectation of continued mix growth in industrial end markets. Automotive OEM build rates are currently forecasted to be down slightly. Consumer electronics are expected to grow low single digits for the year, while semiconductor market is currently forecasted to start the year slow and improve as the year progresses. And finally, consumer retail discretionary spending is expected to remain muted for the year. As mentioned, we expect a strong expansion in adjusted operating margins of approximately 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year, up from an estimated midpoint of 18.7% in 2023. With respect to adjusted EPS, we anticipate full year 2024 earnings in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 per share on a continuing operations basis or over 15% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. Turning to cash. Our businesses continue to deliver strong and consistent free cash flow. Our expectation is that adjusted free cash flow conversion performance post spin will remain in the range of 90% to 110%. Please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year guidance. Included in our outlook is for normal sequential patterns through the year coupled with the end-market trends just discussed. As a result, we anticipate that our second half of the year sales will be slightly stronger than the first half. Our expectations also include a 1% foreign currency headwind to sales given the strength of the U.S. dollar at current spot rates or a negative $0.20 to earnings per share. We also anticipate an approximately 75 basis point benefit to sales from the commercial agreement with Solventum. Please note that this benefit will be reflected within acquisition and divestitures from an external reporting perspective. We expect adjusted operating income and earnings per share to show relative strength in the second half of the year. This is primarily due to the impact from the timing of the Solventum spin on April 1, along with our pretax restructuring charges of $250 million to $300 million that are weighted 70% to the first half of the year. We will continue to benefit from productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by increased investments in the business as we progress through the year. Looking at below-the-line items, we estimate full year other expense net will be in the range of $75 million to $100 million, mostly weighted to the second half of the year. And our 2024 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19% to 20% with the first half of the year coming in at the high end of the range. As Bruce mentioned earlier and detailed further on Slide 26 in the appendix, the new operating category named Other is forecasted to have a net operating loss of approximately neutral to $25 million. This range includes first quarter net operating loss of approximately $65 million on a continuing operations basis. Beginning in April, transition service agreements costs plus a markup will be reimbursed to 3M, and therefore, we will generate modest income in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Finally, Corporate and Unallocated includes full year 2024 sales in the range of $225 million to $275 million for commercial agreements with Solventum beginning in April. We expect full year Corporate and Unallocated net operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. These ranges include first quarter revenue of approximately $25 million and net operating loss of approximately $75 million. As we have previously discussed, we estimate annualized dis-synergies of approximately $150 million to $175 million. These costs were previously associated with Solventum and will now be allocated to Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer starting in April. Specific to Q2, we expect continued strong execution to drive operating performance. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, stock-based compensation grants were delayed to Q2. As a result, we expect to incur $125 million to $150 million in expense in Q2. We will also increase investments to support end-market demand and drive growth and productivity. Please turn to Slide 16 for more details by business group. Taking into account my earlier comments regarding current full year macroeconomic and major end-market forecasts, we estimate organic sales growth in Safety and Industrial to be flat to up low single digits. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be up low single digits. This is better than our estimated range of flat to up low single digits provided in January, recognizing our strong Q1 growth performance. And in Consumer, we estimate organic sales to be down low single digits, which includes our ongoing product portfolio initiatives. These actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind for the Consumer business of approximately 2 percentage points. I want to take a moment to thank our team for the work they have done in successfully executing across our 3 strategic priorities. Their disciplined work has created value and returned capital to shareholders with the successful spinout of our Health Care business. They have also helped reduce risk by reaching 2 large settlements while making progress on the exit of PFAS manufacturing. And most importantly, our teams have made tremendous progress on fundamentally improving how we work, which is driving better performance across the business. In closing, we delivered a strong start to the year. As we look ahead, we are focused on building on our momentum, supporting expectations for a return to organic top line growth, margin expansion, investments in high-growth and attractive end markets and continued strong cash generation. This leaves us well positioned for long-term success and consistent value creation for our customers and shareholders. Please turn to Slide 17, and I will turn it back over to Mike. Mike? Michael Roman : Thanks, Monish. Paying a competitive dividend has been a priority for 3M for more than 100 years. This will continue to be true following the spin-off of Solventum. As part of the spin, we distributed 80.1% of Solventum's outstanding shares to our shareholders and post-spin have made the decision to reset 3M's dividend. As a result, we anticipate a dividend of approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow. This represents a dividend that is in line with our industrial peers and well above the S&P 500 median with the potential to increase over time. We expect to seek Board approval to declare the second quarter dividend in May with payments anticipated in June. In addition, post spin, we have stepped back into the market for share repurchases. Before I conclude, let me emphasize some important points from the quarter. Q1 was a strong start to the year, driven by significant improvements in operational execution as well as the achievement of several major milestones toward our strategic goals, including the successful spin-off of Solventum and the settlement of 2 major legal matters. I would like to thank our people for their dedication and continued focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. Through their efforts, we are well positioned to deliver a strong 2024. Tomorrow, May 1, I transition into the role of Executive Chairman. I look forward to working with Bill Brown as he assumes the role of CEO. That concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We go first this morning to Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Congratulations, Mike, on the transition. And obviously, you'll stay very involved in the Executive Chairman role. Michael Roman : Yes. Thank you, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Absolutely. Maybe just to start off with, Monish, you packed a lot of clarification on the moving parts into the prepared remarks. Maybe just to try and understand a little bit better the quarterly sort of cadence here. So it sounds like second quarter EPS, down slightly maybe versus the sort of [ 170 ] comp ops number for Q1, and that's really because of the stock comp and the one-timers that you talked about. So do we think about sort of second quarter revenue being similar to first quarter margins down a bit because of the stock comp and one-timers? And then as we step into the second half, you've got higher revenues half-on-half and then sort of good operating leverage of the stepped-up revenue. Maybe just any thoughts around that. Monish Patolawala : Yes. I would say, Julian, so you summarized it. I would go back and say there's so many moving pieces that I would really say first look at first half, second half. And then when you do that, we would also show you that on revenue, we are starting to hit normal seasonality trends. So on revenue, the first half, second half is 49-51. And then the margin split first half, second half is 47-53. And the reason for that is some of the items that you've mentioned. Part of the biggest item there is the -- is Solventum's first quarter, where we don't get reimbursed for TSAs, and that's driving the 47 to 53. If you now go into the important factors just into Q2 to make sure that I cover all the points, restructuring charges are between $250 million to $300 million for the year. 70% is weighted to the first half. Similarly, you mentioned it too and I said that in my prepared remarks, we will incur stock-based compensation headwind around $120 million to $150 million. FX, the stronger dollar continues to remain in the second quarter. So we got to factor all that in. And I would say that's why we've given you first half, second half guidance, there are more details. I know Bruce and the team can walk you through it. But if you start with that, I think you'll get directionally in the zone that we are talking about. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then maybe a second question, perhaps more for Mike, but on capital allocation. So clearly, you and the Board spent a lot of time thinking about balance sheet leverage of 3M to settle on that sort of 40% dividend payout ratio. You also mentioned, though, on the buyback some step-up since the Solventum spin. So maybe help us understand kind of how you and the Board are thinking about 3M's leverage requirements from here. How meaningful could a buyback be? And then tied to that, Monish, any clarification on interest expense guide for this year based on that balance sheet? Michael Roman : Sure, Julian. I would start with we continue to be a strong cash generator, and we're well capitalized to invest in our business, which is -- continues to be the first priority for capital allocation and also return capital to shareholders, including the dividend that we've been talking about and share repurchases. And I -- my comment, we're back in the market. The pace will depend on how we view the macro, how we look at our performance, the intrinsic value of our stock. We haven't declared really how we're going to move forward on that. But I -- so well positioned to, like I said, invest and drive the capital allocation priorities that we talk about. Monish Patolawala : Julian, I'll answer your second question. When we talk about below-the-line items, we talk about 2 things : mainly it's pension and it's interest expense/income. So I'll combine the 2. So our guide is net expense of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Q2, as I mentioned, will continue to benefit from the interest income that we receive from the -- dividend that we receive from Solventum of $7.7 billion. And so therefore, the $75 million to the $100 million guide for the year will mostly be weighted to the second half of the year. Operator : We go next now to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Mike, hopefully, the Exec Chairman role is a bit less stressful than Chairman and CEO role. So congratulations on that. So just a few more -- maybe a few more details on the 2Q, Monish. The restructuring -- and I understand 70% in the first half, 30% in the second half. How does that phase between 1Q and 2Q? I'm just trying to understand whether that's fairly level-loaded or whether there's a bit more coming through in the second quarter. And then on the restructuring, I see the total charges. But in terms of the gross payback, what kind of payback are we assuming on that restructuring? And are we still on a 3M RemainCo basis, still on track for $700 million to $900 million of savings by '25? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I'll start with the first one, Nigel. As I said, it's 70% weighted in the first half of the $250 million to $300 million range. In the first quarter, at a holdco basis, we did $122 million of restructuring that I've said in my announcement, and then you'll see Health Care was approximately $20 million of that. So you've got $100 million that is on a RemainCo basis. And so the balance is -- so you can get the math.  When I come to your next piece on payback, I just wanted to start again, I've said this before, I'll say it again, you have to look at restructuring in total. So when we started this program we said, there are multiple things we wanted to achieve. Number one was we wanted to change the way we work, and the way we achieved that was streamlining our supply chain, getting a shorter path to customers and third was reduce stranded cost, have a lighter center as well as create oxygen to invest in the business. And when we put that program together, that was including holdco.  As we have now spun out Health Care, you can see all those items starting to come in, which is margin expansions coming in. And that is happening because of the improvement we have in our supply chain and the way we work. It's happening because we are closer to customers. It's happening because we have reduced stranded cost. When we started our journey and we announced the spin of Health Care, we had said industry benchmark was somewhere between 1% to 1.5% of sales, which is like $400 million to $450 million. And now our dis-synergies from the spinout of Health Care are the $150 million to $175 million, and we're going to keep working that, in some cases, grow into it; in some cases, we'll keep working it down. And you've seen we've been able to do that.  And at the same time, we've created oxygen to invest in the business. And Mike mentioned some of the spec-in wins that we have got in TEBG. We have continued to invest in CBG. In a downmarket, we have done the same with SIBG, and we had over 30 new launches across the company in the first quarter. So that's the way I would look at it.  On a payback basis, I would tell you that we are still continuing to have very good payback. And in fact, we were able to accelerate some of our restructuring actions as well as get some onetime gains like property sales in Q1. So overall, look at the total margin, 200 to 275 basis points up on a year-over-year basis, which is a reflection of all the actions the team has taken. Nigel Coe : Great. My follow-up question is on the dividend. There's been a huge sort of [ core ] industry about the potential dividend scenarios, but hopefully, that's now behind us. But the 40% payout ratio on adjusted free cash flow, is the intent, Mike, to keep that 40% relatively stable going forward, so as you grow earnings and free cash flow going forward, the dividend should increase as well? Michael Roman : Yes, I would think of it as a guide of how we're thinking about it. The approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow, that's the way the Board -- that's the guide that the Board is looking at as we go forward. So I -- that's where we start as we go forward with continuing operations. That's the best way to think about it, Nigel. Operator : We go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, thanks for all your help over the years. Congratulations. Michael Roman : Thanks. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you update us on your industrial channels within Safety and Industrial? Are they generally to the point where you have better visibility and destocking is mostly over? And it does seem like -- for instance, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes has been turning the corner over the last couple of quarters. Is that a bit of a canary in the short-cycle industrial businesses that you have? Michael Roman : Yes. Andy, I would say if you look at inventory in the channels as kind of a measure of that, that's -- I would say it's been reducing some of the inventory in the channel really around improving supply chains. We talked a bit about this last quarter. As supply chains improve, our distributors in the channel are taking advantage of shorter-cycle times and managing down some of their inventory. There's also a bit of a cautious outlook. Monish talked about a mixed outlook for industrial markets. And if you think about it, look at our results from Q1, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes and Personal Safety, when you adjust for the year-over-year respiratory change, those were both -- they are multiple market -- multiple industrial market-focused, and they are both up slightly in the quarter. So they're seeing a bit of both across their markets. We have some market-focused businesses like Industrial Mineral as that's seeing strong demand. And then we have some other market-focused businesses in industrial like automotive aftermarket and our kind of our industrial specialties, which was a lot of our products that go into shipping. So the shipping dynamics, the mild winter impacts on auto repairs, those are -- we're seeing kind of the downside of that in some of those markets. So it's a mixed market. Again, the channel is adjusting, taking advantage of improving supply chains and, I would say, somewhat cautious about the broader mixed nature of those end markets. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Mike. And then, Monish, obviously, you mentioned the relatively good T&E start. You did have a pretty easy comparison in Q1. But 7% growth, you're still guiding of low single digits. I know it's up a little bit. You mentioned the buy ahead was a big part of the Q1 improvement. But is there any reason why your improved spec-ins wouldn't continue in electronics? And then are you seeing any improvement at all yet in semiconductors and those kind of end markets? Monish Patolawala : Yes. I would say, first, we are thrilled that we've got the spec-ins, so that's a big positive. As I said, 2/3 of the total, 6.7%, that's approximate. We don't have the perfect number. We believe it's partly driven by inventory normalization both in auto and electronics, plus customers starting to buy ahead as they start building for end markets or consumer end markets.  What I would tell you is second half is so important for the consumer electronics business, and we are watching that trend. If there is a big pickup in consumer electronics, we will definitely grow with it because we are now specced in to many more devices than before. So that -- I would say second half is what we are watching, but this is where we see it right now. And then on semiconductor, our view is we saw the first quarter slow, and we believe that this will pick up in the second half, Andy. And that's what we are watching there, too. All indications keep saying that it's going to get better, but we are watching those trends. Operator : We'll go next now to Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Best of luck to you, Mike, in your next endeavors, et cetera. Michael Roman : Thanks, Scott. Scott Davis : Guys, I had a couple. I'll just start with a [ knit ] and then ask a real question. But why -- I'm looking at Slide 27. Why does the 2026 payment dip? What was kind of the -- just walk us through a little bit of the color of the kind of how these payments were negotiated annually. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So there were so many facts that were put together, Scott. This is one of them on how these profiles were scheduled. So there's no particular reason to give it out to you. This was a lot of factors, pluses and minuses that put the whole agreement together. Scott Davis : Okay. So there's nothing specific in there that 2026, you'd... Monish Patolawala : No. Scott Davis : I can take it off-line. Monish Patolawala : Yes. Scott Davis : Okay. More importantly, Mike, if you look back at the long-term growth rate ex Health Care of 3M, it's been kind of sub-2%, so below GDP. And that includes some price inevitably, I would assume. What do you think the entitlement growth rate of this business is longer term? I mean just go back 10 years, so I think that's a full cycle for sure. But when you think about the next 3 or 5 years, what do you think that the business should be able to grow at? Obviously, Bill is going to have his own initiatives. But what is your view on that? Michael Roman : Yes. Scott, I won't get ahead of Bill and kind of how he's going to think about going forward. You saw our guidance for this year, it's in line with macro. Importantly, when you look at what drives our growth, it's really investing in the business. The organic investments have been the dominant driver of growth for us as a company, and we expect that to continue as we move forward. Like I said in my speech, making indispensable products for our customers, and that means leveraging our innovation, our technologies, our manufacturing capabilities to come up with differentiated solutions for our customers and do that more and more prioritizing our investments. As we've talked a lot about, where do we prioritize investments? In attractive markets, markets that are -- have growth dynamics that are better than the macro. That's kind of the way to really drive this growth strategy forward, and that's how we think about it. That's how we focus.  It's important that we really do prioritize leveraging our innovation so that we create not only the growth, but the differentiated value leader in a way we deliver value to shareholders in terms of margins and cash. And so it's a -- that's the way I think about the formula for growth, and it's been the foundation for building the company, and it's a foundation for success as we go forward as well. Scott Davis : Totally fair. I'll pass it on, but congrats on getting all this work done the last year. It's -- I'm sure it's been a lot of heavy-lifting. So congrats and best of luck this year. Michael Roman : Thanks, Scott. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : It's Andrew Obin. Mike, congratulations, and great job getting all this legal stuff out of the way. Michael Roman : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes. So I would take an issue with Scott's statement about lack of growth at 3M. I don't know where he's getting his numbers because pre-COVID, company has grown at, on average, at 3.7% organically based on my model. So I actually have the exact opposite question. What is this, for example, safety and growth, right? You say that industrial production is growing 2%, yet the guidance is 0% to 2%. You have 100 bps sort of this portfolio geography drag.  Can we just dig in as to what you think are impediments to growth coming out post COVID? Because it does seem thing has changed after that. Can we just -- right? Because I would have expected that you would outperform industrial production, right? And every year, there seem to be sort of new headwinds that are completely logical, but they seemingly come out of nowhere. Why the company's growth sort of seems to be below average? Michael Roman : Yes. Andrew, it's kind of building on maybe my answer to Scott. The macro is an important part of this, and we think about the macro for us -- for 3M is a combination of GDP where we have our Consumer business, and then it's also around industrial production in a broader industrial and transportation and electronics. But importantly, we go down and we really look at the markets that we're part of. And so driving that growth and, again, the way we deliver on growth better than macro or in line with macro is to pick markets where we can really leverage our innovation and be differentiated and drive our growth out of those attractive markets. And so what is the driver of it? Maybe if you don't do this well, that's your impediment question is to really prioritize those attractive markets where you can -- where we can deliver differentiated 3M solutions. That's the model that will drive us forward. Andrew Obin : Right. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you guys are tweaking your global distribution, exiting some, right, direct distribution. You are starting to utilize distributors. Can you just talk about sort of what have you experienced so far with these changes to the models? What are the pros and cons? Because some of the commentary referred is that 3M is leaving money on the table with its distributor, some sort of legal risk associated. How do you mitigate those? And what has the experience been so far? Michael Roman : Yes. Andrew, just talking about the change, so this was part of the restructuring -- actually was part of the model change that we've been making, really focusing on leading through our businesses globally and prioritizing where they -- the most important parts of their business and looking at what's the best model to put in place. And so geographic prioritization was the way we termed it.  And so we focused on some of those smaller countries that we operate in. We talked about approximately 30. We've launched this in 27 countries at this point. It's really a model to move to an export model. And we do have to -- it's much more than kind of the way we've talked about on the headlines. You have to set up a successful model. You have to set up a model to support distributors. You're changing from the traditional 3M model in those countries to an export-driven model. So it's important that we not only have capabilities in region, but globally to support that kind of model in those countries.  It's also important that we have a strong governance everywhere we operate around the world. So we continue to focus on advancing our governance model as we make those changes. So it is much more dimensions to the change. We're off to a good start and successful with that. We call it a revenue impact this year because we're switching to an export model. And so we're driving a different price model with our distributors. But that is going to continue to drive, I think as it succeeds, will drive very good performance for us on a go-forward basis. Monish Patolawala : It also helps us -- to add on to Mike's comments on pros, benefits, you take a lot of structure out from those countries, that also has benefited us on the margin line. It also helps us focus our portfolio. Like what are we going to sell? And therefore, it's SKU rationalization that once you get through this, you will have a different inventory profile that support those smaller countries. So they're still very important countries for us. In no way are we walking away. It's just a different way of approaching them. Operator : We'll go next now to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Mike, I echo all the best of luck, congratulations. Michael Roman : Thanks, Joe. Joseph Ritchie : I'm going to start just -- just let us start with a quick just clarification. So just apologies if I missed it, like Slide 15, where you give the operating income number of $1.2 billion. So if I just kind of back out the performance this quarter, it assumes Health Care stranded cost of roughly $100 million to $150 million goes to the segment. So I just want to make sure I have that right.  And then also on that slide, on the restructuring charges, Monish, going back to your comments from earlier, so the way to think about it is $100 million-ish the first quarter ex the Health Care number, that's the apples-to-apples comparison to the restructuring charges of $250 million to $300 million for the year? Monish Patolawala : So try me again on the first piece of the question because I didn't follow exactly. But I'll answer your second one. So the $250 million to the $300 million is embedded in here, and that's on a continuing ops basis. So that does not include Health Care. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right. Great. Yes. So just on the operating income quickly, I think you guys have roughly $1.7 billion this quarter. I think we had like roughly, call it, $350 million or so in Health Care profit. So you back that out, that's above the $1.2 billion number. So I was just basically trying to understand how much the Health Care stranded costs go into the other segments. Monish Patolawala : Yes. So I think that there are 2 pieces to this. One is the dis-synergies of Health Care, which on an annualized basis right now, we think it's $150 million to $175 million. And then the second piece of this is, as I've mentioned, there's $250 million of cost that we hold on behalf of Solventum for which you get reimbursed in April 1 onwards. So you eat Q1 with no reimbursement basically. So if you look at our Other segment, Joe, you will see -- or Other category, you will see a loss of $65 million in there in Q1. And that's basically, we don't get reimbursed for that in Q1. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. Okay. No, I think I've got it and can follow up afterwards... Monish Patolawala : Yes, Bruce can follow up off-line with you. Joseph Ritchie : Yes, yes. And then just another quick follow-up on the electronics business. And so I know the stats you kind of gave on demand and then inventory normalization. Is it possible to kind of parse out the inventory benefit that you're seeing? I'm just curious like how much of that 15% came from just inventories normalizing just because -- maybe I'm just not close to it anymore. But I'm just curious, like what other like products are really kind of driving end-market demand for electronics at this point? Michael Roman : Yes. Joe, what we talked about in the results for TEBG in the first quarter in electronics, these are spec-in wins on some of the mobile platforms. And so the inventory, it's getting ready for the demand, really the demand that they're seeing into the second quarter. And at this point, it's really -- that's the step-up. And then there's a portion of it that's inventory kind of filling into the value chain of those OEMs. But it's -- the bigger part of it is the spec-in -- for us, anyway, the bigger part of it is the wins in the spec-in side of it. Joseph Ritchie : And Mike, that's smartphone demand? Michael Roman : It's mobile devices, largely phones. Yes, yes, largely phones. Operator : We'll go next now to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Mike, congrats again, and thanks for all the help over the years and the effort. Michael Roman : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Thanks. C. Stephen Tusa : Just to be clear, you said 40% of adjusted free cash flow. Can you just help us with what the construct of that is? What is adjusted free cash flow? Bruce Jermeland : You're referring to the dividend, Steve, I presume? C. Stephen Tusa : Yes, just the construct. I don't need a number for cash. Just how do you define that adjusted free cash? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So if you look at all our material that we have submitted, you will see historically what we have broken out is from our GAAP results, there are certain items that we have been adjusting to get to adjusted results, which is litigation expenses. Number one. Number two is PFAS because we've been exiting -- we've been showing PFAS as an exit. And number three was all the costs incurred to spin out Solventum or the Health Care business. So it's the same construct there. And as always, Steve, if we decide to change something, we'll keep you all posted on changes to adjustments. So those are the big ones. And if you see our press release statements or schedules, you will see that split by category in there. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. Steve, it's all detailed in our press release attachments. C. Stephen Tusa : Right. So whatever you're paying out in cash for these liabilities, that is adjusted out of free cash. So for example, the $4.3 billion or whatever in this year will be adjusted out, and then you take whatever we want to assume for free cash flow and then take 40% of that? Monish Patolawala : Correct. Bruce Jermeland : Correct. Operator : We'll go next now to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks for clarifying that on the dividend. That was a key question. Also, I just wonder, to any degree, has Bill Brown been involved in the kind of the formulation of the updated guidance here, whether explicitly or tacitly? And I know he's formally starting tomorrow, but just any color on that would be interesting and helpful. Michael Roman : Sure, Jeff. Bill is, as you would expect, getting ready to step into the role. He's been engaged with myself and senior management and the Board since the announcement. But he's really -- his part is being informed and getting ready to start, as you said, tomorrow. He's not part of the decisions on what we've laid out here in the earnings call today. So he starts tomorrow. Bill starts tomorrow, and I look forward to working with him as he does. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then just thinking about, again, the cash flows as it relates to the liability outflow that we're looking at here. What guidance, if any, could you provide on what you're thinking on insurance recoveries? And if you're successful in those claims, when those might start flowing as potential offsets to the liability schedule? Monish Patolawala : Yes. So we believe that we are eligible for insurance payments. We have put our insurance providers on notice for PWS and for Combat Arms. And in fact, for Combat Arms, we have -- we are working on an arbitration to recover that. So as you know, these things take some time to work through, and that's what the teams are working on. And we'll keep you posted as soon as we come to know on what that number could look like. Operator : We go next now to Brett Linzey of Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Congrats to Mike. Michael Roman : Thanks, Brett. Brett Linzey : Yes. I want to come back to the portfolio and the geographic prioritization. So you called out the 100 basis points headwind in '24. Should we think of the first quarter as the starting point and just simply anniversary that headwind for the balance of the year and it's complete? Or is this more of a multiyear initiative with some top line drag? Monish Patolawala : So there's a little bit of drag next year, but I -- it's not big. I would just say the first half of this year will be slightly heavier than the second. But directionally, I would say, yes, you can use the first quarter as the math that gets you across the 4 quarters. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. I guess the follow-up, you called out some contribution from those initiatives in each of the segments. Are you able to size what that benefit is? And I would imagine it's sort of structural, but any color would be great. Monish Patolawala : Yes. I would just say when we look at it in total is why are we doing these portfolio moves or geographic moves. It comes down to it allows us to do better focus, better prioritization. So at the end of the day, you're going to see it in multiple places. You're going to see better sales growth in other products because we're exiting these and the teams can focus, whether it's ad, merch, et cetera.  You will see it in inventory because, again, we'll be able to focus our inventory on the products that we want to focus on. And you're going to see it a little bit in margin. That margin will take a little bit of time to come through. But some of these products that we are exiting are below our average margin. So it does help us lift the average margin. And then as I said on the geographic prioritization side, you get a lot of structure out, which is already embedded in our margin that we are seeing. And we are getting some onetime benefits on property sales that we disclosed this quarter. Operator : We'll go next now to Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: I wanted to ask on PFAS, and you've talked about the exits there, kind of progressing to plan, if not a little bit ahead of plan. But just how do we think about alternatives? I think there's been press over the years on different applications across a number of different end markets when we think about semiconductors or military or auto. Do you expect to participate in that? I mean, where are you on the sort of product innovation pipeline and being able to sort of provide alternative products to what you're exiting? Michael Roman : Yes. And Joe, as I said in my comments, we work with each of our customers as part of the transition. I would say there's kind of 3 alternatives for them. One is PFAS from another source. A number of the applications, many of the significant applications, they're challenged to find an alternative. So that's what they're looking to do is source PFAS from another supplier.  The second one is perhaps there's a chemistry that has similar properties that isn't PFAS, and you can move into that. We're exiting PFAS, and we're not going to move into other chemistries. They'll be durable and persistent to meet the requirements of these applications.  The one area where we can help and what we're doing for ourselves is working to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products. And we're engineering them all. We're designing them. We're on them. And there's a number of applications our customers have where that's very difficult to do and challenging, and they don't know a solution today. But for us, the majority -- the vast majority, we're already worked through solutions. So that's something that we can help customers with, and we are. We're helping them look at the alternative ways to design and engineer their processes and products. Joseph O'Dea: That's helpful. And then second question is just related to CERCLA designation and really just trying to understand what the designation versus not getting the designation means at a high level. I think when you first announced this being proposed, you talked about how 3M's view was this would not lead to a timely or appropriate kind of remediation. But just to try to understand, having the designation versus not having it at the end of the day, kind of what that means. Michael Roman : Yes. There are certain, I would say, EPA responsibilities that would come with CERCLA designation. We, at this point, we don't anticipate an impact on our ability to serve customers. And we'll -- as we better understand all of those requirements, and we're committed to meeting and complying with the requirements under CERCLA and the EPA guidelines. Operator : And we'll go next now to Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : My congrats to Mike and also to the team on orchestrating all these moving parts. Michael Roman : Yes. Thanks, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Deane. Deane Dray : And just a quick follow-up on that last PFAS question. So the enforcement actions by the EPA, they set PFAS as hazardous. So that's a milestone and then in the process of setting up the Superfund. So would either of these actions put you closer to be able to set a reserves? I know you couldn't before for accounting purposes. It was not estimable or the probable, but now we're closer to that. So are you closer to where you could be setting reserves for these remaining unaddressed PFAS liabilities? Michael Roman : Yes. Deane, we are -- as I've said a number of times, we're proactively managing this, all aspects of the PFAS dynamic. And as soon as we can get to probable and estimable, we will take the reserves. And we'll keep you informed, and I would refer to our SEC filings for updates. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And just one other one, I'm sorry. Is there any scenario where 3M would continue to manufacture PFAS after the year-end 2025 target? Michael Roman : No, Deane, we're committed to that exit. We're on track, and we're committed to follow through. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments. Michael Roman : This concludes my last earnings call as 3M's CEO. I would like to thank the investors, shareholders, analysts, employees and family who join these calls each quarter. I greatly appreciate your questions and diligence in working to better understand our company. I'm confident that under Bill's leadership, our people will continue to build on the momentum from our strong start to the year.  Thank you for joining us, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time.",

Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today\u2019s presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll hand the call off to Bill. Bill? William Brown : Okay, thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. This morning we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, up nearly 40% with 1% organic revenue growth. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. I'd like to thank the 3M employees for all their hard work in delivering solid second quarter results. Monish will provide further details on the quarter and then I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with guidance for the year before opening the call to Q&A. I've now been in the job for nearly three months and have been busy visiting a number of our factories and labs, as well as taking a fresh look at our strategy and how we're executing against it. As you know, 3M has been undergoing a lot of change in the past few years following COVID, most recently with a successful spinoff of the healthcare business executing on a significant restructuring effort and working to mitigate risks, including discontinuing PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 and settling legal matters. You've also seen a number of changes to our organizational model, shifting from a geographic to a global business unit structure and centralizing our global supply chain activities under one senior leader. Collectively, this has been a massive transformational change for 3M, and the team has executed really well. As a result of these efforts, you're seeing the benefits in operating margin expansion, strong cash generation, and a solid balance sheet with low leverage ratios and an incrementally more positive view from the rating agencies. Credit to Mike and Monish for their steady hand in guiding the company through these changes. But my job is to look forward and while much progress has been made, we have more to do including navigating PFAS related matters where fortunately we have a strong, terrific team managing the exit and our ongoing legal matters. As I see it, we're still in the early innings of our operational excellence journey and we haven't yet cracked the code on organic growth, which I know is essential to creating shareholder value. So my top priorities are; number one, driving sustained top line organic growth; number two, improving operational performance across the enterprise; and number three, effectively deploying capital. On the first priority, I believe that the company has significant organic growth opportunities as we participate in end markets with favorable secular trends and have a strong foundation and long history in material science innovation. However, as you well know organic growth has been below market indices and peers over several years and up only about 1% year-to-date. Driving sustained organic growth requires both getting more out of R&D, as well as improving commercial excellence. As I've gotten into the details, what I've learned is that ex- Solventum R&D investment for core 3M, which is running about $1 billion per year, or about 4.5% of revenue, has been flattened nominally over the past five years and down on a real basis as the focus was on investing in and strengthening the healthcare business. And within the lower spend, the amount we invest on new product development has declined even further as the company shifted more dollars to efforts to exit PFAS manufacturing and work to reduce supply chain cost and resolve COVID related sourcing constraints. As a result of the decline in investment, along with a strategic shift to fewer, but larger innovation opportunities, the number of and revenue from new product introductions has steadily declined over the past decade. The simple fact is that our products are aging. While we've been shifting our portfolio towards higher growth markets like auto electrification, industrial automation, data centers and semis, climate tech and others, these efforts aren't material enough today to offset erosion in our core. They remain, for the most part, attractive growth platforms, and we need to continue to balance investing appropriately in markets that are evolving quickly, while also investing incrementally to sustain the core products we have today. But before we make any adjustments to our R&D budget, I want to first explore opportunities to get more from what we currently spend. For example, improving the velocity of our new product development process and increasing the effective capacity of our engineers by eliminating bottlenecks and non-value added work, and over time, redeploying those currently working on PFAS exit activities to growth initiatives. With enhanced data transparency and a more coordinated governance process, we can improve R&D effectiveness by deploying resources on the highest return projects. These efforts are essential to reinvigorating the 3M innovation machine, but will take time to bear fruit. So in the near-term we have to focus on commercial excellence to sell more of what we currently offer, and that means better sales force and distributor effectiveness, targeted marketing, optimized pricing, and much better execution at the customer interface, in particular, on time, in full performance, which is a key part of my second priority, operational performance. We have a terrific Ops leadership team in place, executing on a number of opportunities, and I want to give you some color of what I'm seeing so far. I've been looking at our manufacturing and distribution network to understand our global supply chain and distribution capabilities. I see opportunities to reduce complexity, drive lean manufacturing and logistics, improve supply chain management, lower yield loss, and increased service levels with lower inventory. While our network of 110 factories and 95 distribution centers have historically served 3M well, it is incredibly complex and interconnected, with most SKUs we produce touching multiple factories before reaching the customer. For example, a command strip touches five factories and two distribution points before it hits the store shelf. This extends cycle times, increases goods in transit, and drives up logistics and freight costs. In lean manufacturing and logistics, we're developing a consistent metric around operating equipment efficiency or OEE, to increase equipment utilization and rein in capital spending and mapping modes and flows to lower freight and distribution costs. In supply chain, we have significant opportunities to improve our sourcing effectiveness. We have more than 25,000 direct and indirect suppliers, including nearly 4000 contract and component manufacturers, yet more than 80% of our raw materials are sole sourced. We haven't been holding our suppliers accountable to the same quality and delivery standards as our customers hold us to, and we're only beginning to leverage our scale to reduce cost. Relative to yield loss, our raw material waste is running close to 5% of cost of goods sold, due in part to how we design and manufacture our products, but also due to inefficient production scheduling and changeovers. And finally, we have too much inventory at about $4 billion in 102 days at the end of Q2 and yet our service levels are only in the mid-80s. Our bottoms up analysis indicates we should be closer to 75 days of inventory or lower, which would imply about $1 billion cash opportunity over time while we drive on time in full above 90%. My third priority is effectively deploying capital, and our approach remains the same as it's been investing in R&D and CapEx to fund organic growth, paying an attractive dividend which we just recalibrated with the spin of Solventum, maintaining a strong balance sheet and using excess capital for M&A or share buybacks. We repurchased about $400 million in stock in the second quarter and have the capacity to do more in the second half and next year. While no acquisitions are on the near-term horizon, I'll be taking a fresh, dispassionate look at our portfolio to determine if any assets have greater value owned by others, and along the same line, what assets might be a good fit for 3M. I don't have anything further to say on that today, but you can expect to hear more from me regarding portfolio prioritization as I deepen my understanding of our businesses and end markets. So for the past three months, it's been pretty busy with a lot still to learn. I think we have a good foundation to build upon and believe that this focus on fundamentals, back to basics approach will drive value creation. I'm encouraging everyone at 3M from top to bottom to every day challenge the status quo and the way we've done things in the past, to act with speed and urgency and to off-board those things that distract us from growing, innovating and executing for customers and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the quarter and I'll come back to discuss guidance. Monish? Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. I would like to take a moment to briefly remind you of a few items that we highlighted during last quarter's earnings call. Beginning with the second quarter, our results for business segment operating income includes prospectively the impact of dissynergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. Therefore, for historical pre-spin periods presented, the dissynergies are reflected in corporate and unallocated. In addition, we added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement activity. Other includes our Q1 cost associated with supporting the agreements for which 3M started to be reimbursed for in April. And finally, corporate and unallocated incorporates the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1 and retrospectively picks up certain operations of the former healthcare business retained by 3M. Turning to our second quarter performance, we posted solid adjusted results, including sales of $6 billion, operating margins of 21.6%, earnings per share of $1.93, and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We delivered adjusted organic growth of 1.2% or up 2.4%, excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect the trends that we have previously discussed, including strong growth in electronics, mixed industrial end markets and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. We had another strong quarter of execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 440 basis points year-on-year, and delivered adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. Please turn to Slide 5. On an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.6% up 440 basis points and earnings of $1.93 per share, up 39% versus last year's second quarter. Our second quarter year-on-year performance was driven by organic growth, productivity, strong spending discipline and restructuring savings which combined benefited operating margins by 310 basis points and earnings by $0.31 per share. In addition, income from the transition services we are providing to Solventum increased margins by 50 basis points and earnings by $0.05 per share. These benefits were partially offset by stock based compensation which was shifted into the second quarter due to the spin of Solventum. This was in line with what we discussed during our first quarter earnings call. This change in timing negatively impacted operating margins by 200 basis points and earnings by $0.18 per share versus last year's second quarter. Lower year-on-year restructuring charges were a benefit of 270 basis points to margins and $0.23 earnings to earnings. For the second quarter restructuring charges were $44 million, which were lower than anticipated. For the full year we continue to expect pretax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $300 million. Foreign currency was a negative $0.04 per share impact as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. Acquisition and divestitures were a benefit of 10 basis points to margins and $0.03 to earnings year-on-year. This benefit is related to last year's second quarter reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies along with the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum. Below the line items benefited earnings by a combined $0.14 per share. This benefit was primarily due to increased interest income year-on-year on a higher cash balance due to in part by cash proceeds received from the spin of Solventum. Taking into account our first half of the year performance, we now expect our full year non-operating expense to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million versus a prior range of $75 million to $100 million. A quick comment on corporate and unallocated and other before moving on to cash flow, Q2 corporate and unallocated sales were $86 million with a $2 million adjusted operating loss. Year-to-date, corporate and unallocated sales were $112 million with an adjusted operating loss of $73 million. This is in line with our full year anticipated sales range of $225 million to $275 million with a forecasted adjusted operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. Our Other category had operating income of $37 million which reflects the level of activity and effort to support the successful spinout of Solventum. Year-to-date Other had an operating loss of $28 million which is in line with our full year expectation of flat to a loss of $25 million. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our second quarter performance was driven by strong operating income, lower CapEx spending partially offset by higher working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $250 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter we returned a total of $800 million to shareholders split equally between dividends and share repurchases. And finally, net debt at the end of Q2 stood at approximately $3 billion. These strong results build on our track record of robust cash generation. For the first half of the year we have generated $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. Our strong capital structure continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. Please note that in the month of July we will make total combined payments of $3.7 billion related to the Public Water Supplies and Combat Arms settlements. Before I move on to our business segment performance, I want to highlight a couple of items for your awareness that were excluded in arriving at our Q2 adjusted results. First, note that we reached settlements of approximately $120 million with insurance carriers related to combat arms. We remain in discussion with multiple carriers and anticipate additional future recoveries. Second, during the quarter we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $800 million related to a $2.5 billion pension risk transfer on a portion of our U.S. defined pension obligation with Met Tower Life. This action helps us to reduce risk and administrative fees related to our U.S. pension plan. Please turn to Slide 7. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion, up 1.1% organically. Industrial Adhesives and Tapes posted mid-single digit organic growth driven by strength in Bonding Solutions for Consumer Electronic Devices. Personal Safety and Automotive aftermarket grew low single digits. Electrical markets was up slightly while roofing granules was flat due to unplanned customer manufacturing challenges. And finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in Abrasives and Industrial Specialties. Geographically, industrial markets grew low single digits in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, while EMEA was down low single digits. Overall, industrial end market demand continued to be mixed in the quarter as end user and channel remained cautious. Adjusted operating income was $623 million with adjusted operating margins of 22.6%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by higher sales volume benefits from ongoing productivity and restructuring actions and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. These benefits were partially offset by the timing of stock based compensation and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 8, which posted adjusted sales of $1.9 billion, or up 3.3% organically. Our electronics business outperformed the market up low double digits organically as we continued to gain spec in wins on consumer electronic devices and in semiconductor manufacturing. Our auto OEM business increased nearly 5% in Q2 versus a 0.5 point decrease in global car and light truck bills. Looking at the first half of the year, our auto OEM business was up 9% organically versus a flat global build rate of cars and light trucks as we continued to gain penetration on new platforms. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, advanced materials grew mid-single digits organically and commercial branding and transportation was down low single digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $426 million in adjusted operating income, up 16% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.3%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on electronics volumes, ongoing benefits from productivity and restructuring actions, and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. Partially offsetting these benefits were the timing of stock based compensation grants and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Turning to Slide 9, the consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 1.4% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending. This included a 2.7 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home Improvement grew mid-single digits, Consumer Safety and Wellbeing grew low single digits, Packaging and Expression declined low single digits, while home and auto care declined mid-single digits organically. Geographically, the U.S. was up slightly, Asia Pacific was down mid-single digits and EMEA was down high single digits. Consumer second quarter operating income was $219 million, down 7% compared to last year with operating margins of 17.4%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margin performance was driven by lower volume and timing of stock based compensation grants along with the cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from lower restructuring charges. Before I turn it back over to Bill, I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the tremendous progress they have made positioning the company for success. I am very proud of the relentless focus our teams have brought to create value by driving performance through our improved productivity and efficiency, spinning out of our healthcare business and reducing risk and uncertainty by managing legal matters. I am confident that under Bill's leadership, the team will continue to build on this momentum to create consistent value for our people, our customers and our shareholders in the years to come. I would also like to thank all the analysts and investors for our rich discussions and engagements over the last four years. With that, please turn to Slide 10 and I will turn it back over to bill for an update on our guidance. Bill? William Brown : Thanks Monish. Given the strong operational execution in the first half of the year, we're raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $20 to a range of $7 to $7.30 versus $6.80 to $7.30 previously, now up 16% to 21% year-on-year. Full year adjusted operating margins are now expected to be up 225 to 275 basis points. Full year adjusted organic growth remains unchanged at flat to up 2% with expectations for second half organic growth in line with first half performance at the midpoint. While significant macro uncertainty remains, our business segment and market trends are largely playing out as expected. Year-to-date Safety and Industrial organic growth is approximately flat versus a full year expectation of flat to up low single digits. We expect that industrial end markets will remain mixed as channel partners and end customers continue to remain cautious on overall demand trends. On an adjusted basis, transportation and electronics is up nearly 5% organically in the first half versus a full year expectation of up low single digits. Strength in the first half was due in large part to consumer electronics along with automotive. We continue to monitor auto build rates along with consumer electronics demand trends for the back-to-school and holiday season. And finally consumer is down nearly 3% organically through the first half of the year versus a full year expectation of down low single digits. We continue to expect that consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted in the balance of the year. Before we'd open up to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Monish for all his contributions and impact on 3M over the past four years. While I've only had a short time working with him, he has been a strong partner and has helped me get up to speed on the company, and I've enjoyed working with him. I appreciate everything he has done to navigate through a number of challenges and to make 3M stronger along the way. With that, let's open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning, everyone. Hello, Bill and Monish. Thanks for all the help up unto this point. Hey, Bill, thank you very much for that very thorough and detailed kind of deconstruction of the history on organic growth and the like and I appreciate your comment that it will take some time to kind of get after these things, but are you actioning some of these ideas already? Can you give us a sense of how some of these changes on the front end of the business as it relates to organic growth may be kind of put in action? William Brown : So good morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my remarks, there are two major thrusts here on driving organic growth. One is certainly to spur innovation and driving innovation to turn the top line up, drive organic revenue. And so part of it is, we've got to sort of bottom out on how much we're spending on new product development and start to turn the ship. The first half of this year we launched about 75, 76 new product introductions. This year we'll do probably less than 150. And as I reflect back over the last eight or nine, 10 years, at one point in time we did over 1000. So we've really got to turn that around. It's going to take some time to do that. We continue to invest some of our precious R&D dollars on cost reduction and PFAS exit, stabilizing our supply chain. I made a comment about 80% of our raw materials coming in a source. We've got to qualify other vendors to be able to reduce costs over time. So that's going to take some time. What I'm really working on as well in R&D is ideas for how we can offload non-value add activities from our researchers. It really comes in two, three themes. One is both efficiency as well as effectiveness. I think there's an opportunity to drive effective capacity of our engineering team. I think we have an opportunity to drive velocity through the new product development pipeline. We have an opportunity to think differently and how we govern differently on R&D, where we place our precious dollars so that they can move across the company to the highest ROI investment. So that's what I'm focused on, on R&D. But again, it's going to take a little bit of time. So we've got to sell more of what we have on the market today. That's simply commercial excellence. I'm digging into a number of different factors. We've got a sales force today it's just over 5000 people. We know over the last four or five years it's down about 25%. That's partly because of the export model we've moved to. But we have an opportunity to take a look at our coverage, our incentives, our training around our sales force. I think there are some opportunities there. We distribute to almost 30,000 distributors. I think we have opportunities there. There are probably some opportunities in pricing at a high level. We've done a very good job at the covering inflation and we'll see some incrementally positive pricing this year. But when you get down to a granular level there's some disconnects between pricing and discounts and margins to the volume or size of the customer and we have an opportunity to take a harder look at that. We're looking very hard at advertising and merchandising. It's a lever that's important in our consumer business. We were down quite substantially from where we were before relative to consumer packaged goods type companies, we're down. So we have an opportunity to think differently and very tactically around advertising and merchandising. I think lastly we're looking at cross selling. There are certain examples, certain places where we sell products into a distributor or into a customer, but those customers, they should be buying a different product from us, but they don't. For example, for customers that do surface by surface conditioning products to polish metals and woods, you always use a respirator to do that. You want to look at our customers. There's a bunch that don't buy the respirators from us, so there's an opportunity there. All of those things are levers that we're going to be pulling here in the short-term, Jeff and we'll keep updating analysts and investors as we learn more about how do we really drive the top line, which is so crucial to driving value creation at 3M. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, thanks for that and maybe just one other quick one. Well maybe it's not a quick one. I appreciate the detailed answers. On kind of the operational excellence side of the equation and a lot of these KPIs that you're speaking to on delivery quality and the like, does this require sort of a heavy lift on restructuring? The company's gone through a lot of restructuring recently, including just coming to the end of a big program or do you kind of view these as just more kind of process improvements and things of that nature? William Brown : So you're right. We've been through and are actually getting through a very substantial restructuring program, about 75% complete. It will drag into 2025. I think the team is executing very well on that. A lot of the things I'm talking about in terms of improving OpEx, they're incremental pay-as-you-go type of opportunities. You almost get the savings as you're covering investment. There are potentially over time some bigger bites. If you think about the complexity of our broader network, a few years out there could be additional restructuring, but can't size it today. Right now, the opportunities that I'm seeing are almost pay-as-you-go. Reducing waste and inefficiency in factories are things you can do and just execute against without substantial charges to get there. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thanks and good luck. I appreciate it. William Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Oh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hello, Bill. It's been a while and I wish you good luck. William Brown : Thank you, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So I think you might well have answered my question, but I do want to just kind of ask about the plants and the distributions at the footprint. I think you mentioned 105 plants and 95 DCs, 110 plants and 95 DCs. So are we talking here about, over time, a significant shrinkage in that footprint, or is it more a reconfiguration to reduce the complexity of the product velocity around that network? And then thinking about the opportunities around sort of investing to drive growth versus efficiency, how should we think about margins beyond 24? Are you confident we can still grow margins beyond 24, even though it sounds like you're going to be investing? William Brown : Okay, so a couple of good questions, and I'll try to hit on them pretty quickly. You're right, 110 factories, 95 distribution centers. The fact is, if you go back in time, the team here has actually been reducing the number of factories, the number of DCs in our network, and there's some inflight in the restructuring program we have today. Looking forward, we don't think we necessarily need 110. I can't decide what it exactly is and when that cadence might happen, but we're taking a hard look at it. But it's not just factories, it's also cells within factories. When you look at what we have in assets and cells within these factors, we have 250 coating assets that are spread almost through half of our factories. And you have to sit back and ask, as we drive operating equipment efficiency, do we really need all those assets in all those factories, or do we have an opportunity to increase effective capacity. So these are things that we're working on. Peter Gibbons and a team are doing a great job at this. This is going to happen over time. I can't really size how many factors of the restructuring that's required to get there. Relative to margins, the team has done an outstanding job. You can see in the first half of this year, up almost 500 basis points. So the margins have come up quite substantially. We've got more we can do here in terms of just basic blocking and tackling productivity. Volume clearly, as it comes back, volume clearly is going to be a high leverage ratio for us. So where they can go from here, I can't size it today. Certainly, as we get to the balance of the year into 25, we'll give you some more outlook on that. But there's lots of levers here, including driving organic volume. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks Bill, that's great color. And then Monish a quick followup on the insurance recovery. That's obviously great news on the Combat Arms recovery. Can you just disclose how many carriers are you negotiating with on Combat Arms? And maybe just bring us up to speed in terms of what's the opportunity within the water settlement? A - Monish Patolawala Yes, so Nigel, as you know, there's a tower insurance here, so we are dealing with multiple insurance providers. We were pleased with what Kevin Rhodes and the legal team have done on getting the 120 this quarter. And as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that we believe that there is more to be had here and we'll definitely keep you all informed as these things happen. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Bill. Welcome, Bill and we'll miss you Monish. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning Bruce, too. Bill, is your -- I don't want to read too much into this, but is it your view that 3M is just too diversified and needs to kind of narrow down even a little bit more than what we've already seen with the Solventum spin? William Brown : Well, I'm not sure I would say that today, Scott. In fact, as I think about it, it's a big business, a complicated business, a lot of different end markets, different business segments, different ways of going to market. A lot of the stuff that we make goes across all of these factories. So there's a lot of interconnection across the business. But as I've done in my past, I'll do the same thing here, which is take a fresh, hard look at what businesses that we're in. And as Mike said in my prepared remarks, dispassionately do that. Really look hard at what is better owned by us and we'll make some determinations over time on that. At the same time as we think about the kind of business that we want to be in over time, are there assets that aren't owned by 3M that are better owned here? And we'll take a hard look at that piece there as well. So I wouldn't draw any specific conclusion from my remarks other than we're going to take a hard look at it. And if we determine that something is better owned elsewhere, then we'll move forward in that. It's all about value creation for owners. Scott Davis : Fair enough. And I guess when I looked at your list of priorities, operational excellence, all these things are kind of basic. I don't want to minimize, but this is, it almost feels like you're walking into a situation where a lot of things weren't done right. And I don't want to point fingers, but just point being is, what was the fail? Was it just compensation and kind of where people's priorities were placed and you need to change a compensation plan? Was it just that a lot of these things like lean manufacturing were just not seated or seated early enough? I'm just trying to get my arms around. I have followed 3M for a long time and we've had a number of different CEOs who have come in and had kind of a similar tick list that we want to fix this, this and this, but have struggled to kind of get there. And I'm trying to just get my arms around, what do you think was the main fail that kind of led us to where we are today? And is there kind of one main thing that you can kind of tick the box first and work on kind of through the list? I know that's a little bit of a tough question, and again I'm not trying to point fingers, just saying that it's a pretty heavy lift. I think some of these things, a lot of people try pretty hard to fix, thanks. William Brown : Look, I'll just say it's not about fail or success or right or wrong. I come in with a different set of experiences, different background, fresh look at the way we do business from the things that I've done in the past. I think the team here has done a marvelous job in managing through a lot of complex situations. I was a CEO of a company through COVID, and what we dealt with is well short of the challenges that 3M has faced, and you bring on top of that, a lot of the liabilities that Mike and the team have managed through, the structural changes. There's been an enormous transformation effort. And as I said, they launched the restructuring program. We're 75% complete. It's gone very, very well and you can see that in the margins. That's gone very well. I come in, I just look at it the way it is today with sort of looking at the cold hard facts, and it's a back to basics focus on the fundamentals approach does sound \"basic\", but at the end of the day, I do think that there's a lot of value that can be created from the raw materials that we have here. Just focusing on just how do you turn the business to top-line growth through the things that I've talked about, commercial excellence, driving growth from R&D, and driving a real culture of operational excellence through the company, and move at these things with speed and with urgency. I've been in situations like this before. It's easy to fall into a trap of this is the way things have been done. And as I said in my remarks, I'm encouraging people to challenge the way we've done things in the past every single day. That's what continuous improvement is really all about, and that's what I'm encouraging people to do. So I'm looking from here forward and I see a great opportunity for value creation. Scott Davis : Fair enough, Bill. Best of luck. William Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Welcome to Bill and Monish, thanks for all the help down the years. May be just the first question around the reinvestment point and organic growth, so Bill it sounds as if you can reinvest sufficiently in the business in the medium term to get growth moving, but still see reasonable margin expansion. I just wanted to confirm that that is what you're saying. And then on that growth rate point, I wondered sort of what your initial thoughts were on the growth entitlement for 3M. Maybe what you think it's addressable. Markets are growing at, how you view the growth rate of its aggregate peer set. Just the context I suppose is 3M has grown around 1% to 2% the last five to 10 years ex-Solventum. I wondered what you thought the market growth rate was versus that? William Brown : So a couple of good questions. I mean first, we do expect that we have some capacity in the back half to incrementally invest in the business. I think Monish and Mike have talked about this in our guidance model. We still see some opportunities to incrementally invest. We'll talk more about where that might be in the back half. But we always said with the savings that we're generating from restructuring, some of that savings would be reinvested back in the business. That's been the case so far and we see some additional opportunities in the back half of the year. My comments around sales force, my comments around advertising, merchandising, at least a couple of different items. I can't say much about R&D today. I want to look harder at how do we free up capacity of the investment we make already today, and can that be more streamlined and redeployed effectively on top line growth? And that's really a big focus of mine. In terms of entitlement growth, certainly we should be growing better than we have and we were guiding 0% to 2% midpoint of 1%. We know there's 1% headwind because of exiting certain geographies and parts of our portfolio, but still on an adjusted basis, 1% to 3% organic. It probably should be a bit more than that. GDP is in the 2.5% range. IPI we think this year is around 1.7%, 1.8% or thereabouts. We should be growing at least at the level of the economy, if not perhaps slightly better. But more comments as we get towards the back end of the year and into 2025, give you some longer term outlook for where the company might go. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just may be toggling back to the short-term as a lot has been asked about the medium term, if we're just thinking about the sort of framework for the second half guidance, I think it's implying an operating margin in the second half of maybe 21% or so. A little bit better perhaps, and that's fairly flattish year-on-year and half-on-half. I just wondered if I had that right, because it looks like restructuring charges are shrinking year-on-year and half-and-half and the top-line is pretty steady. So I just wondered if that was the correct assumption and any drivers behind that and if there was any preliminary thoughts on sort of third versus fourth quarter dynamics here? William Brown : So, yes, let me offer a couple of comments here and I'll ask Monish to maybe fill in a little bit of the blanks on the quarterly progression. But you're right in terms of the cadence here. We do expect revenue to be very similar in the second half to the first half, and that does reflect historical trends. We continue to see strong operational execution and spending discipline just like we saw in the first half. We'll see some tailwinds from the benefit of lower restructuring cost, which is now 60/40 first half, second half. Last time it was 70/30. So some has shifted to the back half, but you do see a bit of a step down. And we do see reimbursement of transition services agreement with Solventum, which began in April, but at the same time we have higher wages in the back half of the year. We have two full quarters with a wage increase. Our wages went out on April 1, so not in first quarter but in the second, so that's a bit of headwind. That's offset by some lower stock comp. As you know, we made our grants here in the second quarter. We do see some headwinds in our factories. We built inventory through the second quarter that caused some positive absorption. We'll see inventory coming down in the back half of the year. That's going to cause some negative absorption or some headwinds there and then some higher non-operating expenses driven by pension and higher interest costs. We had a lot of cash balance here in the second quarter. Cash went out the door in July for some legal payments, legal settlements. So our interest costs, interest expense is going to go up. Our interest income will come down in the back half of the year. And then of course, as I mentioned before, we do see some step up in some investments we have in the back half of the year. So those are the biggest drivers. A little bit of tax geography, but those are the biggest drivers. Maybe I'll ask Monish to comment on Q3, Q4 cadence. Monish Patolawala : Sure. And just Julian, to add on to Bill's points on first half, second half, just data points. We spent $165 million in the first half on restructuring, and at the midpoint that would be another $110 million in the second half. So the tax rate will be around 19% in the second half versus 20% in the first half. If you now go to just the guidance between 2Q, 3Q or 3Q, 4Q, 3Q revenue trends will be very similar to what we saw in 2Q. I think Bill already talked about what it looks like in the market, so that's where the team is seeing right now. I would say continued strong operational execution and spending in 3Q also. You will get a tailwind from the timing of stock comp, which we announced in 2Q, approximately 100 of it that comes back as a tailwind in Q3. But at the same time, as Solventum matures in its ability to execute independently, we also believe that they will keep exiting their TSAs. As I've told you, the TSAs, some are short-term, some are as long as two years. That could go up to three years. We will see lower fees as Solventum begins to exit. And that's an impact of approximately $0.09 from a headwind on an EPS perspective, which is overall still in the range 2Q was heavier than 3Q and 4Q. Bill talked about the seasonal impact in our factories as we bleed down inventory in Q3. Restructuring costs based on what the team sees right now is flat Q2 to Q3. So the balance will go into Q4 as we talked about. And then you will see -- we talked about $0.11 EPS impact for the second half on Combat Arms and PWS. As you know, we have made payments. By the end of July we would have made $3.7 billion of payments under our agreements under the settlements under Combat Arms and PWS, which means you have a lower cash balance in Q3, and that impacts us $0.06 of EPS. So between pension and interest costs, that's a headwind Q2 to Q3. The team continues to believe that they can step up to drive long-term growth, to step up investments. And then tax rate for the third quarter will be in the range of 20% to 21%. And the fourth quarter is, the whole year is, I mean, the second half is 19%. So you can back into the fourth quarter, which would be lower. Hopefully, this is helpful to get your models right. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steven Tusa : Hi, good morning and Monish, thanks for all the help. It wasn't always easy for you guys, but really I appreciate you being front and center with the details and always doing your best to give us visibility of things, so we really appreciate the help there. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Steve. Steven Tusa : And Bill. My first question is, will you get any summer vacation at some point? Because it sounds like, I'm not sure I've ever seen a new CEO in the first three months be shot out of a cannon like this and have this kind of detail. You're usually supposed to wait for about a year so you can reset and get the options before you give the long-term target. So we really appreciate the detail here. It sounds like you've been busy. Just the elephant in the room, though. You talked a lot about capital allocation and I think the narrative obviously around PFAS is that there's negative optionality from the balance sheet, if you will, but that it's a drag. You're talking about being a little bit more on your front foot from that perspective. And the only place PFAS is mentioned is in the Slide 2, which is in the legal disclaimers. You didn't talk about it really at all in the slides. What's your take there? And do you have any perhaps pivot and strategy around PFAS in that liability? William Brown : Well, thanks for the question. Look, first of all, we've got a great team of advisors, legal inside and outside that are managing PFAS and other liabilities. When I step back and look at just where we've been, the Public Water Supply settlement was a great step, important first step, really in managing some of the risks. But there's more to be done. We're continuing to manage litigation from some of the opt outs, other cases within the MDL [ph], there's Europe that's sort of hanging out there. We continue to control in that area. We've got very exhaustive disclosures in the Q and the K and again we have a great team that are really focused on managing that. Where I think I'm best putting my time are the things that drive value creation for our owners and that's driving the top-line and driving operational excellence in the business. We do generate great cash flow. We see it in the quarter. We saw the first half, 90% to 110% free cash flow conversion for the year. I've got ideas on how we can drive that further over time. We're at 0.3 leverage ratio. So when I step back, I think we actually have a very strong balance sheet. We can manage appropriately the risks that we see in front of us. And even through that, we have options here to do things with our balance sheet. So, I'm focusing on the things we can control and really getting the team pivoted back to what do we do to drive growth and operational excellence. Steven Tusa : What do you think the market is missing in its pretty harsh and negative narrative around this PFAS overhang from what you've heard? William Brown : I can't really comment on what the market may or may not be missing on that, Steve. What I'm focusing on the things that we control. I read the Q very, very thoroughly, like all of our investors do. It takes a long time to get through it. I think we've done it. We do a great job at the disclosure there. But again, we've got a great team that's managing this. It's a dynamic situation and I trust what they're doing. I'm involved in that. Mike has been very helpful. He has a lot of expertise in this area because of the time he had to spend on it. I'm relying on him here as well. And again, I think where my time is best placed is what do we do to drive the other 64,000 of the 65,000 employees? What are they going to do to drive value creation? We've got a lot of people focused on PFAS. We have to get people focused back on the core things and what makes 3M great. Steven Tusa : Right. It's good to know you're reading the Q some time in your travels to sit back with a nice scotch and read the Q. Thanks a lot. Good luck and looking forward to connecting. William Brown : Likewise. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. William Brown : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Monish, thank you for all the help over the years. It's been a pleasure. Monish Patolawala : Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on, just followup on capital allocation. It seems that with a lot more visibility on PFAS sort of operational focus, the market is clearly reacting to the message very positively. What are the thoughts about maybe front loading share buyback, particularly as you release working capital? Improving on time delivery, what is, and I know you sort of highlighted buyback as one of the key opportunities, but in transformational stories like this, buying stock at the bottom tends to pay off longer-term. What's your view and the view of the Board on buybacks? Thank you. William Brown : Well, thank you. You're right. I was very purposeful in the four top priorities for capital deployment and number four was around excess cash for repos, or M&A. There's just not M&A on the horizon. So you saw a step into the market in the second quarter. That was under Mike and Monish's leadership, $400 million worth of buyback. We do have capacity. Our balance sheet looks very strong. We have an open authorization with our Board that's close to $4 billion. We keep evaluating this as we sort of manage the risks that happen to be out there, our ability to generate cash, drive down working capital in the back half. And through all those levers, we'll look hard as to what we do with excess cash in the back half as well as into next year. Nothing more to say about that today. Andrew Obin : Sure. And, historically 3M has been one of the companies that investors would buy, towards the bottom, towards the economic bottom as things reaccelerate. I guess, two part question. First, do you think 3M still has this cyclical leverage? Because you talked about your product introduction being down quite a bit, but generally do you think this fundamental quality of the business to really reaccelerate into improving industrial and maybe one day consumer fundamentals is still there? And B, second question is, how far away do you think we are from sort of industrial bottom? Because it just seems like there is no end. We just can, PMIs can find a bottom if, you know, if you could just sort of provide us with your view even when there is any visibility on things bottoming out. I know a long question, but I appreciate your answer. William Brown : No. Good question. I mean, I do think, I do hope that we're bouncing along the bottom. It all depends on what happens here in the back half in the U.S. certainly and what the Fed does with interest rates and what's going on with inflation. There are a lot of geopolitical questions around the world. So I'm optimistic that the market is going to start to recover. But again, I don't have a crystal ball, like nobody on the call really does. So at the end of the day, I step back and I look at what do we do with the assets that we have. And I think about the long history that 3M has in core innovation, new to the world ideas. And I think as we reground ourselves back on that long-term mission, that culture, that spirit of innovation and we reignite that across the thousands of employees in this company that drive it every single day. To me, that's what I'm focused on. That's what I can control. There are lots of great markets out there. There are lots of different pockets of places where we can invest in to innovate, to penetrate, to grow, to differentiate offerings versus our competitors. So that's what I'm focusing my time on. The economy is going to do what it's going to do. I'm just watching where the trends happen to be and investing in places where we think we can drive some differentiation and grow higher than the market. So long answer to your question, but that's the way I think about it. Andrew Obin : I really appreciate it and look forward to working with you. William Brown : Likewise, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. William Brown : Good morning. Monish Patolawala : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Monish, thanks for all your help. Bill, I look forward to working with you. So maybe, Bill or Monish, you mentioned that growth across your businesses has generally been in line with your expectations. But just focusing on transportation, electronics, I know comps get a little more difficult in Q4, but would you say there are some upside as your original low single digit growth forecast there? Do you see consumer electronics holding up in the second half and have you seen any improvement yet in semiconductors? William Brown : TEBG: Monish Patolawala : No, same thing. I think we'll have to. Andy, as you know, this is cyclical, so we'll have to watch what happened in the second half. Bill mentioned that even in the prior question and that's what the team is watching. We are watching all the trends that all of you watch, which is build rates on cars, build rates on consumer electronics, what the holiday season turns out to be, I think, are all factors the team look. They watched in the past and will continue watching. And based on what we know right now, the team feels the guide that we have given you, which is for the company as a whole, is fair. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful. And then Bill maybe can you talk about 3M's ability to price across its portfolio? When I hear the conversation regarding limited new product intros and R&D, obviously the thought is that can all impact price. So how structurally, how effective can you be and how fast in sort of impacting pricing? And then it's hard not to notice. Consumer, for instance, remains pretty muted. I think that is just the market, but is it particularly challenging to price in that segment? William Brown : That's a very, very good question. From what I can tell last year, we had pretty significant price increases and we did cover inflation. This year in our sort of 1% center point of our 0 to 2 guidance, we have positive price within that. So we continue to see pricing. It's certainly lower than on a year-over-year basis than it was last year. So on a macro basis, our ability to price has been pretty good with capturing back inflation. But what I'm looking at is the more details around how we price by customer, by segment, by product, not just gross price, but net price. So discounts, market development funds, all of those things between gross and net price. And is there an opportunity at the real micro level to price better? My instinct is that there is an opportunity here and this is an area that I'm going to focus a lot of time and attention on that. Sometimes it's training, sometimes it is systems, sometimes it is data visibility. But there's an opportunity on a much more granular level. Take a look at how we price, and I'll know more in the next number of months and couple of quarters as we go through the analysis. But I do believe we'll find some opportunities do better job on pricing there. The other point you had mentioned about new product development, you're exactly right. Which is as we innovate and develop differentiating features, we should be able to get better margin and better pricing on those new products that are coming out. So as we reinvigorate the NPI engine, which I expect to do, hopefully that does drive price improvement, margin improvement, over time as well. Andrew Kaplowitz : I appreciate the color. William Brown : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph O'Dea of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Joseph O'dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. William Brown : Good morning. Joseph O'dea: In the interest of time, I'll just keep it to one. But Bill, just curious if you could expand a little on the dispassionate portfolio review comments. I understand sort of no specifics today, but if you could just talk about your timeline for completing reviews? And then as you do these, what are the key metrics that you ask business leaders to present on in the reviews as you sort of focus on decision making there? William Brown : So good question and look, 90 days in the job, I'm trying to learn the business, learn, meet the team, understand what's going on in the business. So there's a lot that's happening right now and I'm really focused there. I'm not to the point of any particular occlusions, I'm not necessarily near that. But it is something that's on our mind. We're going to look hard at. The teams are looking at this as well, is how are we growing in each segment versus competitors. What's the earnings growth outlook? Are we able to expand margins or not? What does our NPI pipeline look like? And based on who we compete against, do we have an opportunity through better execution, through better operations, through new products coming down the path, to improve our positioning in certain segments. At the end of the day, we're an innovation driven company. Technology differentiation is the lifeblood of how we compete. So I'll be looking hard at businesses where we can bring technology differentiation into the business and provide value to customers that's different than our competitors. And I contrast that with commodity like businesses that perhaps don't really fit so well. So, no specific lens other than that, but we'll take a hard look at this and make some conclusions in the coming quarters next year as we get our arms around what's the business we should be in and also which businesses that we ought to be looking at outside the company. Joseph O'dea: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. William Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bruce Jermeland : Joe, are you there? Operator : Mr. Ritchie, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. We are not hearing your question at this time. And Mr. Ritchie, please check your mute button. We are still unable to hear you at this time. Mr. Ritchie, please. Bruce Jermeland : Operator, let's just move on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question now from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning all and welcome to Bill and best of luck to Monish. William Brown : Thank you. Brett Linzey : Yes Bill, I appreciate the rundown on the priorities. I thought the example on the command strips was quite striking. As you're thinking strategically about optimizing some of these touch points, do you think you have the personnel resources internally, the incentive structure internally to drive these changes or are you looking to third parties? Just trying to understand the timeline and what needs to be done here. William Brown : Oh, thank you. Yes, this is a -- it\u2019s a complicated problem. It\u2019s a lot of products, a lot of SKUs across a lot of factories and distribution points. If you look at this on a global basis, you map all the DCs and all the flows, all the factories, it's a spider's nest. I mean, it's a lot going on here. And we do have a great team in operations that are looking hard at this. We have outside advisors that have been involved and this will take some time. It's not a quarter, two quarters away. We'll continue to take a hard look at optimizing the networks and the flows. So, we have the right people at the top level and I do think that we've got the right incentive structures around this as well and motivations for the team. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I appreciate the color. I'll leave it there. William Brown : Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys, and welcome, Bill and thanks, Monish, for all the help. Maybe Bill, you could talk about the level of employee response and engagement. I suspect that you've probably been making a bit of a world tour in your first few months. All of this change sounds really exciting and would just love to hear how employees have been responding to what you'd like to do. William Brown : Look, I think employees here are excited. They're engaged. They want to make a difference. They want to see 3M grow. They want to see share price come up. They want to see recognition for doing great things in the world and then developing new products. That's the message I'm providing to you today. That's the message I'm offering to our employees. My priorities as I have explained to you, is what I've explained in some more detail with employees in town halls. So I think it's resonating well. I think hopefully it's energizing people, but again, we've got a lot of strong people here who have been here for a while, that really want to make a difference and I'm appealing to that. So I think the response has been good so far, again 90 days in. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Bill. In light of time, I'll pass it on and let someone else ask. Thank you. William Brown : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : WE'LL take our next question now from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning and welcome Bill and all the best to Monish. William Brown : Thanks, Deane. Monish Patolawala : Thank you. Deane Dray : Lots of impressive game plan in terms of all the different operational initiatives bill, and it just raises the question for me is, you can't do everything at once. So what's the element of triage? And also, this is not a one man show. Talk about your team. Are you deputizing internal folks? You have an army of consultants, you've got a CFO search you've got to do, and then how much change can the organization handle at once? Is there any element, I mean, lots of stuff needs fixing, but is there a sense of how you can layer these in and can change be too disruptive? William Brown : No, it's a great question. I mean, look, these are all important priorities and I do think we can both try to drive growth through the mechanisms that I mentioned, as well as operational excellence. I think it's fundamental. I've been through this before. It's my first rodeo on these things. I can see a path to getting this work done. We have a great team of employees here. We have engaged outside advisors to help us across these different pieces and focus in some of these dimensions. Yes, it's a busy start, but I think we have the right team to deliver it. I think we have the right focus and priorities. We're going to have to manage it and manage the capacity of the team to respond to all these pieces, but yes, I'm optimistic. I think we'll look at these pieces individually as we go forward. I've laid out a pretty full laundry list of things we want to do, but we'll prioritize these things as we get towards the back end of the year. But at the end of the day, we're not going to be able to invest to grow unless we drive operational excellence. And I would say operational excellence is in fact a growth driver. When you're running, you are on time and out of your factories at mid-80s, 86 and change percent was our second quarter results. We should be above 90%. The fact is, when you're below 90, we're missing sales. So by getting our operations to run better, that is a growth lever. As we drive productivity in our factories and create savings there, that we can reinvest in growth initiatives, that's a growth lever. So I think you've got to do both of these two pieces at the same time and work the pedals and that's what I plan to do. Deane Dray : Thank you. I'll leave it there. I appreciate it. William Brown : Sure. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Kevin [indiscernible] on for Laurence. So I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of Chinese demand and whether you're seeing any green shoots there? And I'll leave it there just because of time. William Brown : So thank you for the question. Look, China for us is about 10% of our revenue. We had a good first half. We're up about 13% in the first half and part of that is electronics. When you look at the piece that's sort of local for local, if you will, it's about 1% so flattish and pretty similar to what other multinational, maybe even a little better than what a lot of other multinationals are seeing in China. Again, it's about 10% of our business, an important market, and we've seen good growth in the front half of the year simply because of the consumer electronics and auto builds. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments. William Brown : Okay. Well thank you, everybody, for joining and participating today and for the thoughtful questions. I want, again, thank all 3Mer\u2019s around the world for their hard work and their dedication and I want to wish Monish well in his future endeavors. So thanks again for joining the call and I wish everybody a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, October 22, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Bruce Jermeland : Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Anurag Maheshwari, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Anurag will make some formal comments then we\u2019ll take your questions. Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today\u2019s conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today\u2019s press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll hand the call off to Bill. Bill? Bill Brown : Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I\u2019d like to take a moment and welcome Anurag to his first 3M earnings call. Anurag recently joined 3M in early September after serving as CFO of Otis. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Anurag off and on over the past 20 years and look forward to his leadership and partnership as 3M\u2019s CFO. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.98, up 18% on 1% organic revenue growth. Our overall company margins increased 140 basis points to 23%, and free cash flow was $1.5 billion, with conversion of 141%, and we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter via dividends and share repurchases. These results extend our strong 2024 operating performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first three quarters, up 30% on 1% organic revenue growth. As a result of the team\u2019s strong operational performance and disciplined capital deployment, we raised the bottom end of our full year earnings guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7.20 to $7.30 versus a prior range of $7 to $7.30 per share. During our Q2 earnings call, I described our top three priorities : number one, driving sustained top line organic growth through both reinvigorating innovation and improving commercial excellence; two, improving operational performance across the enterprise; and three, effectively deploying capital. As I mentioned in July, getting more productivity out of our R&D investments is going to take some time, but we are beginning to make progress on both R&D effectiveness and efficiency. A lot of our recent efforts have focused on the basic blocking and tackling and improving the fundamentals of our R&D and commercialization processes. For example, we have taken actions to improve enterprise-wide visibility on specific investments in our product development pipeline. And we are driving new rigor and discipline into product launch calendars and raising accountability for post-launch sales performance. We are fast-tracking projects for low-risk product line extensions eliminating non-value-added activity from our engineers\u2019 workload by offloading or outsourcing administrative tasks and increasing pipeline velocity through efforts as simple as reducing the time to setup an SKU from 100 days on average last year to about 60 days this year. And to address bottlenecks and drive productivity in the product development process, we are shifting capital spending within our existing budget to fund upgrades of R&D facilities to allow us to scale rapidly from lab to pilot to manufacturing. And finally, we are shifting about 100 people within R&D to focus on new product development, including those who are rolling off PFAS-related projects and adding more than 50 new engineers in the fourth quarter to high priority focus areas such as specialty materials and films for the automotive, aerospace, electronics and semiconductor markets. After a decade-long slide in new product introductions, we bottomed out and are starting to turn the corner with new product launches expected to be up about 10% this year with a further acceleration next year. I recognize these are only initial steps on a long journey toward bending the organic growth curve. And in the meantime, we have to improve how we execute at the customer interface. We are working through the details of how we staff, train and incentivize our sales force, price our products, leverage our distribution network and capture cross-sell opportunities, and we\u2019ll share those details as they evolve. But one area where we\u2019ve seen continued progress is delivering on-time in-full or OTIF to our customers. I know we\u2019ve lost business and have paid fines due to poor delivery performance. And I\u2019m encouraged by the steady improvement we\u2019re making, ending Q3 at 89% OTIF, up 5 points since the beginning of the year and 10 points above Q4 of 2022. As we push harder on OTIF, we are getting more visibility on the weak links in the value chain from the performance in our factories, to our suppliers and to our logistics providers. In our factories, we are looking harder at the reliability of our assets and our capacity to surge. And we\u2019ve now implemented a common metric to measure operating equipment efficiency, or OEE, across the major assets in our 38 largest facilities. Utilization on these machines going back to the beginning of the year, averages around 50%, well short of best-in-class companies, importing opportunities to free up capacity to better respond to quick turn orders by optimizing changeovers and improving maintenance practices. When it comes to our suppliers and contract manufacturers, we are implementing more rigorous standards and expectations for on-time performance, which has been running in the low 60% range for the past few years and is now in the low 70s. A common theme in all of these discussions is the need for significantly higher demand visibility and forecast accuracy, which has been running in the mid-60% range, 10 to 15 points below expectation and well below best-in-class companies. We recently kicked off a project to redesign our forecasting process and we are in the early stages of a 15-week sprint to test and tune our demand plan for two large divisions using different analytical tools. Initial results through the new model show a lot of promise in improving forecast accuracy, which will allow us to level load our factories, reduce inventory throughout the value chain and improve on-time delivery to customers. As I mentioned in July, this is a back to basics focus on fundamental approach that lays the groundwork for a more holistic look at network complexity. While we have closed facilities in the past and have a few more in flight today, gaining maturity in our OEE metric will allow us to take a fresh look at consolidation opportunities at both the site and the work cell level over time. A critical enabler of our OpEx agenda is the depth and capacity of our operations leadership team and we continue to onboard new talent, particularly in the areas of quality, materials planning and continuous improvement. These efforts are all part of a broad operational transformation at 3M, the foundation of which is a safety-first culture. While our injury rate has improved versus last year, it\u2019s not where we want it to be. Earlier this month, we launched a company-wide campaign called Journey to Zero that engages every employee in our drive towards an injury-free workplace. Turning to capital deployment. Through 9 months, we have generated $3.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow with conversion of 102%, after investing $1.7 billion in R&D and CapEx. We have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders, including share repurchases of $1.1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are actively reviewing our portfolio with a few small businesses now in the early stages of a sale process. So overall, we are making progress on the three priorities that I\u2019ve laid out, and I\u2019m encouraged by the energy and desire of our team to win by delivering for our customers and creating value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Anurag to provide more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Anurag? Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Bill. Starting with overall company third quarter performance on Slide 4, total adjusted sales were $6.1 billion, with organic growth up 1% or up 2% excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect end market trends that were largely in line with expectations, including mixed industrial markets, strong growth in electronics, a decline in automotive OEM build rates and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. Looking geographically, adjusted organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up mid-single digits, driven by our electronics business. The U.S. was flat with strength in home improvement and commercial branding and transportation, offset by a tough comp in personal safety as self-contained breathing apparatus benefited from significant supply recovery last year. And EMEA was down low single-digits due to the decline in global car and light truck builds. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 23%, driven by benefits from improved organic growth, continued productivity and restructuring. This strong operating performance, along with benefits from below-the-line items resulted in adjusted EPS of $1.98, up 18% or $0.30. Turning to revenue by business group on Slide 5. Safety and industrial sales were $2.8 billion, with organic growth of 0.9%. The growth was primarily driven by the industrial adhesives and tapes division, which saw particular strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices. In addition, we saw growth in roofing granules and electrical markets, while the balance of the divisions was down slightly due to ongoing market softness and unfavorable prior year comps. Transportation and electronics adjusted sales were $1.9 billion, up 2% organically. Our electronics business delivered high single-digit organic growth as consumer electronics, OEM customers ramp production volumes ahead of the upcoming holiday season. Automotive and Aerospace division organic growth was down mid single-digits in the third quarter. The auto OEM business declined in line with global car and light truck builds, while aerospace delivered strong growth driven by bonding and acoustic solutions. Year-to-date, our total auto OEM business was up 4% versus a 2% decline in global car and light truck build rates. We continue to gain penetration with adhesives, tapes, display films and electronic materials on multiple new auto OEM platforms. Looking at the rest of the transportation and electronics, Advanced Materials grew high single-digits with strong glass bubble demand for light-weighting applications in transportation and oil and gas markets. Commercial Branding and Transportation was up low single-digits driven by demand for graphics and pavement markings. Finally, the consumer business sales were $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 0.7%, which included a 2.3 percentage point headwind from portfolio prioritization. Home improvement delivered mid single-digit growth driven by new products in our command portfolio, introduced for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. The remaining divisions within the consumer business declined due to portfolio prioritization actions as well as retail customers continuing to be price-sensitive and value focused. Through the course of the year, the consumer business has improved and we expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6. As mentioned, on an adjusted basis, we delivered Q3 operating margins of 23%, up 140 basis points and earnings per share of $1.98 or an increase of $0.30. Operational performance, including organic growth, along with ongoing benefits from productivity and restructuring contributed 160 basis points to margins, while foreign currency was a headwind of 20 basis points. These items, combined with acquisition and divestiture impacts, contributed $0.14 to earnings. The remaining $0.16 of EPS growth was driven by last year\u2019s high tax comp, along with benefits from net interest and a lower share count. Turning to cash, we generated solid adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, driven by strong income generation and positive working capital flows while continuing to invest capital to support growth and sustainability. Conversion for the quarter was 141%. Overall, we have had very strong year-to-date operating performance. We have expanded margin 380 basis points, grew EPS by 30% on 1% organic growth and generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow with conversion of 102%. Based on this performance, we are updating our full year 2024 guidance on Slide 7. We expect our full year adjusted organic growth to be approximately 1%, with business group estimates unchanged, with safety and industrial flat to up low single-digits. Transportation and Electronics, up low single-digits and consumer down low single-digits. Full year adjusted operating margins are expected to be up 250 to 275 basis points versus the prior range of 225 to 275, driven by continued momentum from productivity. The operational benefit, combined with lower net interest expense and share count, gives us confidence to raise the lower end of our EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7.20 to $7.30. Finally, our expectation is that we will continue to deliver robust cash flow with strong working capital performance in the fourth quarter. With year-to-date conversion at 102%, we expect that the adjusted free cash flow conversion performance will be 100% plus for the full year. Before we turn to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the warm welcome. I am excited for the opportunity ahead of us and look forward to working with the team as we execute the priorities Bill has laid out. With that, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody, Bill, Anurag and Bruce. Bill Brown : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : And congrats to all on a good start here. Yes, I want to talk a little bit about this operational transformation, it seems like a pretty heavy lift, but obviously, you\u2019re making some progress, but last quarter, you spent some time on supply chain, not in prepared remarks, not as much this quarter, how big of an opportunity? Is that kind of step two or step three down the road and kind of getting the supply chain reoriented? And how big of an opportunity do you think that is, Bill, now that you have had a little bit more time in the seat? Bill Brown : So, Scott thanks for the question. Look, we continue to make good progress across all of the elements in our operations. Our cost of goods sold is $13 billion, a piece of it, a big piece of it is supply chain. So obviously, that is a high degree of focus. We are looking to drive 2% net productivity, so 2% net of inflation across all those elements, including in supply chain. We have about 25,000 direct suppliers, including 4,000 contract manufacturers. Our teams are working hard to consolidate that, drive performance. And we continue to do a good job on this. I think we are at the front end of what I would say to be a long journey. I think we get a lot of value out of basic negotiations. I think we have a lot more opportunity as we think more about value engineering in our product, that\u2019s a relatively small component of our overall supply savings. So, the teams are working, I think, very, very hard on this. Again, as I step back across all the $13 billion, if you drive and get 2% net, you\u2019re talking $650 million more or less of $250 million, $260 million worth of net productivity. There is a lot of value there that we can capture year-over-year. I spent a little time in my prepared remarks talking about one of the key levers, because I think it\u2019s both a growth and an operations level and that\u2019s delivering on-time in-full. And we are getting \u2013 doing very well \u2013 very good job in our factories. The team is performing well, but it\u2019s pointing out some opportunities to drive better supplier performance. And we are really, really focused on that. We have seen some improvements over the last year, but I think a lot more to do in terms of driving the full value chain performance improvement, including with our supply base. Scott Davis : That\u2019s helpful. And Bill, you talked a little bit about needing to change the incentive structure a little bit, will you \u2013 do you think you\u2019ll have a new incentive structure and comp plan in place for 2025? And what does that really mean? Does that mean kind of increasing the variable component? Can you really dialed in kind of to where you want it this quickly? Bill Brown : So, good question, Scott. I think look, before we get to the comp plan, I think what\u2019s going to be more important for us is to make sure we have very clear objectives across the management team, deep in these organizations. So we all understand what we\u2019re accountable to achieve to shareowners into one another. I think that\u2019s step one. And I do think we have an opportunity to get a little more crisp on our objective setting process. But of course, the back end of that is comp plans I think you will see some adjustments in our \u201825 comp plan. We are out speaking with shareowners about that based on the results we had earlier this year in our AGM. But yes, we\u2019ll continue to look at our comp plans, not just at executives, but as it flows into the organization. And importantly, with our between 5,000 and 6,000 salespeople out there, we will continue to look at, do we have the right incentive structure to drive the right behaviors across the full 60,000 plus people in the company. So Scott, there is going to be changes that will be made. We\u2019ll talk more about that as they come to fruition in the coming months. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you, Bill. Best of luck, guys. Bill Brown : Thank you, Scott. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Good morning. I guess I\u2019ll ask two questions. Follow-up on Scott\u2019s questions, just, Bill, what are your views on centralization inside 3M? I know Mike pushed for a lot of centralization, which was a departure from what his predecessor Inge Thulin has done, which ran the company in very, very decentralized way. So, just would love to hear how your operating philosophy has evolved since you joined the company? That\u2019s part one. And part two, we are just getting a lot of questions on insurance recovery related to PFAS and combat arms, particularly given the new side of carrier where they indicated that perhaps, they could indicate, they could recover insurance in excess of their cost. These are public statements. So any sort of publicly available updates on where you are in the process on insurance recovery would be helpful? Thanks so much and congratulations on a good quarter. Bill Brown : Great, Andrew. Thanks for the questions. I mean, first of all, I think about 2.5 years ago. Mike did consolidate all of our factories and supply chains under a common leader, under Peter Gibbons I think it was the right thing to do. It allows us to look across 110 plus or minus factories and close to 100 \u2013 to an 80 and 100 distribution centers and really look at performance, performance metrics, how they compare with one another. It\u2019s a network, they flow together. So artificially separating them that by a business group or by geography did not make a lot of sense, so you\u2019ll get the power of the whole by looking at all of the operations together. So, if you call it centralization, I call that global coordination. I do think that was the right step and it was smart to do that. And we are reaping the benefits of that. And I think going forward the value we\u2019ll be able to get out of operations is because of that operational, that organizational change. So I think it was the right step. I think the move to globally coordinating business units, depending upon the business, some we run globally, some we run regionally, but all within those three broad business groups. I also think that was good. There will probably be some adjustments in how we structure the BGs over time, perhaps within the three business groups. There are certain geographies that stand out that we are really focusing heavily on and we want to put a little more attention on. But generally, I think Mike was taking the right steps and particularly in the supply chain area. So that\u2019s on that piece on sort of your point about centralization. On insurance recoveries, just quickly, you\u2019ll see this in the Q. In Q3, we\u2019ve covered $54 million in insurance recoveries between combat arms and public water suppliers, year-to-date, it\u2019s over $175 million. Recovery efforts continue. I know it\u2019s top of mind given what other folks are talking about. We are active in arbitration and litigation with multiple insurers. We intend to ramp up our recovery efforts in the coming days and weeks. And we do expect our insurers to honor their policy obligations to us in full. The difference with others is our liability that we settled for is quite a bit higher than our insurance \u2013 total insurance value. So it\u2019s a little bit different than others, but we are ramping up our efforts and we are starting to recover, and we\u2019ll recover more over time. We\u2019ll update investors each quarter and through our Q as we recover more on insurance. Andrew Obin : Thanks very much. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. And Bill thanks for the update. These are really helpful. On the insurance point, I just wondered could you maybe clarify what the total coverage would be from a product perspective. And I understand that you are working on ramping up the recoveries there. But my first question is really around the 2 points of net productivity. You\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives in play here. You\u2019ve got the supply chain nationalization, OTIF target improvements, OEE improvements and a lot of other things as well. Any sense on what\u2019s more important here? Is the supply chain driving the bulk of that 2 points in the next 2 or 3 years? I mean any sense there? And do we need some heavy lift restructuring to achieve those targets? Bill Brown : So thanks for the question, Nigel. I don\u2019t think I can say much more on the insurance recoveries or how much we are getting, I mean, other than what we\u2019ve captured to-date. So I think we\u2019ll update you on that as we go. We expect that to ramp a bit better. But look, when I step back, I mean look at $13 billion worth of cost of goods, half of that is going to be roughly is supply chain. So you\u2019d expect the bigger parts of our productivity is going to come out of supply chain. We have seen restructuring benefits flow through in our factories. That is also a factor. We continue to drive lean activities on our factories and you are seeing the benefits of lean production, lean operations across our factory network. We are seeing benefits in our transportation cost and our logistics expense as running through our distribution centers. Last time, I spoke quite a bit about the amount of waste we generate in our company. It\u2019s \u2013 or yield loss, however you want to characterize it, 5% of cost of goods. So it\u2019s quite substantial. We are getting at that you are not going to get big, big dollars every year. You get it in tens of millions and chunks over time. But we are at it. We are running kaizen events continuously to go get it. We\u2019ve more than doubled the number of kaizen events this year over last and we expect that to continue going into next year. So, all of these pieces will drive that net productivity. The teams are at it. We are pushing hard. I would say stepping back the biggest part is going to come out of the biggest part of cost base, which is supply chain. Nigel Coe : Okay. Bill, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe Anurag, congratulations on the new role, just wanted to maybe get a bit more color on 4Q, especially it looks like 1% organic growth very much on trend, but it looks like the 4Q margins coming in about 20.5% at the high end, quite a big step down Q-over-Q. So just want to make sure that\u2019s the right math and any below line color would be helpful? Anurag Maheshwari : Great. Thanks a lot, Nigel. I think you covered it. The Q4 margins are pretty much in line with what we expected. Sequentially, Q4 has been lighter than Q3 margins by about 300 to 350 basis points due to seasonality, which translates into lower sequential revenue of about $200 million, lower under absorption in the factories due to shutdowns, inventory management and timing of cost and investments. So overall, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we expected. But if you kind of take a step back, we raised the bottom end of the guide by $0.20 or the midpoint by $0.10 and that is largely because of the focus on productivity. We have seen good, really good progress on that. Plus the share \u2013 benefits of share repo and the higher cash flow generation, which is leading to a higher interest income or lower net interest expense. So putting all of that together, making progress across all these areas and Q4 pretty much in line. Operator : We will go next now to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone and welcome aboard, Anurag. Hey, I just wanted to come back a little bit in the neighborhood of some of these earlier questions. Predominantly, I just want to get a sense of the fact we are kind of at the tail end of the prior restructuring. I think you did $165 million of spending in the first half and had something like $110 million to go in the second half. So I am trying to get a sense if that is still on track? And then, Bill, of these very numerous and granular things that you are laying out here, are we seeing much benefit from that in 2024 or is this really sort of laying the groundwork for 2025 and a lot of the margin expansion in 2024 is really the underlying prior restructuring plan? Bill Brown : Hey, Jeff, it\u2019s good questions. I mean, first, on the restructuring, we are on track. Your numbers are right, $165 million in the front half and about $110 million or so in the back half of the guidance, so $275 million for the year. That\u2019s about where we are at. And there is a little bit more that will tail into next year to complete the program. And yes, some of the gross margin and net margin improvements this year coming from restructuring, they are coming from a lot of productivity programs that have been in flight, some are ramping up and have more focus and effort in the last 5 or 6 months, but a lot of these things are going to be realized over time. This is a football metaphor. It\u2019s a couple of yards and a pile of dust in lots of ways to get ground game going on operations excellence. It\u2019s a multi-quarter, multi-year journey. So the way I look at this, I think we\u2019re still, Jeff, in the early innings of becoming operationally excellent. And I think the bulk of the opportunities are ahead of us, which is why I think as I look out the next 1, 2, 3 years, we should continue to see margin growth coming out of a lot of what\u2019s happening across our factory network. There is a lot of levers to pull. There is no big winners, no big hitters here that drive a big one-timer in a particular quarter, but it\u2019s getting better at all of these things every quarter, quarter after quarter, and then extending that sort of philosophy on operational excellence across the rest of the enterprise. There is no reason why being good and reducing waste and improving throughput doesn\u2019t extend to how we run R&D, how you run a legal function, HR function, finance. And I think when you do across the whole enterprise you really start to become a much better company. And I think between now and then, we\u2019ve got a lot of room to go and a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Jeff Sprague : Great. Understood. And then just thinking about kind of the capital deployment question, you stepped up on buyback a bit in the quarter in spite of writing a sizable liability check. How should we think about just managing kind of the outflow of cash on repo and/or dividend against the backdrop of sort of the schedule of liability payments? I mean maybe it\u2019s kind of a question about what\u2019s the comfort level on minimum cash or something like that as you are operating going forward? Bill Brown : So I\u2019ll start, and this is Jeff, and I\u2019ll turn over to Anurag, as the new CFO to offer his thoughts, because I know he has been putting a lot of time on this. But yes, I mean, we did step up here in Q3 on repurchases. It\u2019s at about $700 million. It\u2019s $1.1 billion year-to-date. Look, we are generating good cash flow. We don\u2019t see on the horizon going out through next year big liability payments that aren\u2019t already on our balance sheet. So we\u2019ve got an opportunity to deploy capital. I think we were smart in doing that here in Q3. We have got capacity. We ended Q3 with a pretty hefty cash balance. Our leverage ratios remain pretty attractive. We\u2019ve got an open authorization from the Board. So look, we took advantage of that here in the third quarter. We\u2019ve got more capacity to do more. And so I feel pretty good about where we stand today. But maybe Anurag, as the new CFO, can comment on his thoughts on just the strength of the balance sheet. Anurag Maheshwari : Sure. Jeff, I really believe that our capital structure is actually solid from a cash balance, leverage, cash flow generation and optionality perspective, which allows the optimal capital deployment and allocation. As Bill mentioned, we have a very hefty \u2013 good cash balance. We ended the third quarter at $7.3 billion, which is more than 2x of the working capital requirements of the business. On leverage, it was a net leverage of 0.8x at the end of the third quarter, and more importantly, maintaining a strong investment grade rating with ratings of A3 or A minus. And as we\u2019ve seen through the quarter and the course of the year, the cash flow generation has been robust. For the first 9 months, we generated $3.5 billion of cash flow and that\u2019s after investing $1.7 billion on R&D and CapEx. And we do expect in years to come the cap \u2013 as earnings grow, we make progress in working capital, especially in the area of inventory, this will increase our cash flow and keep the conversion higher than 100%. Also, we have optionality in terms of the 19.9% stake in Solventum and any other future portfolio reshaping we do. So putting all of that together, it\u2019s a strong capital structure. We have optionality, flexibility to invest in the business to drive growth and also to return capital to shareholders. So, that\u2019s an active discussion we\u2019re having and we\u2019ll probably come more about it, talk more about it over the next few months. Jeff Sprague : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning and welcome, Anurag. Maybe, Bill, a lot of very good color on the \u2013 some specific sort of tools around driving operational excellence, but maybe trying to tie it together, I think at a conference for about 6 weeks ago or so, you talked about getting gross margins for 3M into the high-40s. Right now, you are sort of 42-ish or so rate, including some charges. So is the right way to think about the medium term, maybe sort of 400 or 500 points of gross margin uplift on the sort of total enterprise level? And then operating expense inclusive of SG&A and R&D, that\u2019s sort of staying relatively stable in the low-20s as a share of sales as you sort of squeeze out more efficiency and returns from the R&D? Bill Brown : Yes. So Julian, it\u2019s a good question. We are running kind of in the low to mid-40s right now and gross margin in the 43%, 44% range, plus or minus. There are points in time in the past where we were high-40s. That\u2019s excluding healthcare. So in our \u2013 the way we have our business structured today, it\u2019s certainly achievable. As I laid out sort of the math there and earlier in this conversation, $13 billion worth of cost of goods, if we do 2% net productivity, it\u2019s more or less $260 million. If we did it every year, it\u2019s sort of a point a year of gross margin. Of course, there is lots of dynamics here. You\u2019ve got mix happening in the business. You have new products coming in. We have got kind of, as next year, middle of next year as we exit PFAS manufacturing. You have some under-absorbed costs within those factories we\u2019ve got to take care of. Eventually, Solventum is going to move some of their production away or in the TSAs will wind down. We\u2019ve got to absorb that. So there is going to be lots of puts and takes. So it won\u2019t be a linear journey over the next number of years, a growing gross margin. But I do see that that\u2019s a big focus of ours. We have got to be really pushing that hard to drive gross margin improvement over time. Our R&D level is about 4.3%, 4.4%. I mean it could drift up, it could drift down a little bit in the tens of basis points, it\u2019s not in \u2013 or tens of basis points, it\u2019s not a big mover. SG&A could see some leverage over time just based on volume. But I think the bigger driver in the future is going to be coming out of gross margin. And I remind you, I am focusing on growth and margin expansion for sure, working the pedals across both of them. But as I step back, driving growth is also a margin driver because of a high drop-through we get on incremental volume. So that\u2019s kind of the way I see the future playing itself out. I don\u2019t think today, I\u2019ll get much more specific. We\u2019ll lay this out a little bit more clearly to investors as we turn the corner in \u201825 and come back and host an Investor Day towards the end of February. I think we\u2019ll have a little more clarity in laying this out a lot more clearly to investors at that point. But anyway, that\u2019s the math as I see it today, Julian. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just circling back on your top line comment just there, so you\u2019re moving at about sort of a point of organic growth through the second half year-on-year, just wondered how you\u2019re looking at the overall sort of demand environment into next year? And when we think about the netting off of NPIs picking up versus your pruning efforts about 100 points this year, how are you thinking about the net of those two items over the next 12 months? Bill Brown : Well, look, 1% organic this year isn\u2019t what we should be aspiring to. Again, it\u2019s the middle of the range we set a couple of months ago. It\u2019s traveling in the order of where the market happens to be. IPI is running around 1%, 1.1%. It\u2019s 1.2% for the year, steps up a little bit going into next year. GDP in the 2.5%, 2.7% range. Again, that\u2019s kind of in the same line next year. So it\u2019s low single-digits. And I think overall, we are performing kind of in line with that, including auto build, semis, electronics, all this consumer, all that together, trending in line. I look at NPI, and as that matures, early good signals were up 10% on numbers of launches this year over last. We see that rate accelerating 25%. But stepping back, we\u2019re still in order of magnitude less than we were at the peak days in terms of how many products we\u2019ve launched in the marketplace. So we\u2019ve got to get that R&D engine moving again. That is going to be essential to improving on our growth rate and starting to hit and then outgrow the market. That will start to bear fruit into next year, maybe the end of next year and into \u201826. And that\u2019s why it took a lot of care last time and earlier to say we have got to get better at selling what we have on the market today, which means we got to work our sales force and all those pieces of it. Do we have gaps in our sales force coverage? Do we have the right incentive structures, the right training, the right people in the field, the right distributors? Are we pricing correctly? Do we have cross-sell opportunities? All of these things will drive growth. And I think we\u2019ve got to pull all those levers. And it\u2019s why I came back earlier on in this conversation, it really doubled down on OTIF, because we are losing business if we are not delivering it on-time in-full to customers. We know it. We see it every single day. So that is the nearest term lever we can pull is getting better on on-time in-full. And as I step back and you put all that stuff together and turn the corner into \u201825, we should see better growth. That would be my expectation. But it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. These efforts do take some time and we\u2019ll lay this out a lot more clearly to investors as we turn the corner into \u201825. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just a little bit more on some of the portfolio review comments you made at the beginning, Bill. I guess any thoughts on like what types of businesses could be considered non-core? And if there is anything chunky coming or if these are all kind of like smaller divisions or businesses that you are looking at? Bill Brown : Yes, Nicole, thanks for the question. Look, I mentioned last time, I did it very purposely that we are going to take a fresh dispassion and look at the portfolio, as you would expect, I would do coming into this new company. But let me step back, I mean, the lens that I am looking through is a strategic lens at the moment to think about the portfolio. And it\u2019s really on where we can leverage technology in innovation to differentiate to win at the customer interface. When it came to 3M, it\u2019s very clear to me, very clear to all those 6,000 people that have been here that technology is what differentiates 3M. People join the company because of innovation. So I am really looking through a lens of can we leverage investments and the capabilities we have in material science and technology to make something different versus competitors and solve the need that others can\u2019t. And that\u2019s the lens that I am really looking at here. So we have a few businesses that are small. If and when we transact on them, you won\u2019t notice it in the overall report. There are a couple of points of revenue. So, it\u2019s relatively small, but it\u2019s a start. It\u2019s the things that I thought were near term and the ones that we could take advantage of today. But our evaluation continues. Again, as I turn next year, we come up in front of investors. I am expecting that I\u2019ll be standing in there talking about a matrix, which has something looking like what parts of our portfolio perhaps don\u2019t fit to us over time. And at the same time, it\u2019s not for today, but looking at what other things do belong with us that aren\u2019t currently owned by 3M. So, it\u2019s a pretty holistic assessment. We are in the very, very early days, Nicole. But a couple of deals that we are pushing on right now, early stages, but it\u2019s the direction we want to head in over time. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. That\u2019s clear. Thanks, Bill. And then maybe just on the business trends, what did you guys see in China in the quarter and any thoughts on 3M\u2019s ability to benefit from stimulus activity happening there? Bill Brown : So, China for us is a pretty good size market. It\u2019s about 10% of our sales. Year-to-date, we are up about 11%, more or less, a little bit higher than that in the first half, a lot of it driven by automotive, up mid single-digits here in the third quarter, pretty much in line with, I think, where the market is in China. So, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s happening there and a lot of it is driven by automotive. Roughly half of what we do in China is for export, export out of the country and roughly half stays within China. And both are performing reasonably well. We will see as we get into next year, the outlook for the overall economy, we can read where the GDP happens to be forecast for next year. But there is a lot of stimulus activity, a lot of conversations around geopolitical issues we\u2019ll see as we turn the corner where China is going to be. But we are bullish on the economy there. We are bullish on our team there, our ability to compete. We have more than 5,000 people on the ground, 7 factories. And I think we have a good ability to be a strong participant over time in China. Bruce Jermeland : Hey, Nicole. Nicole, just to quickly clarify, the strength has been in electronics in China, not automotive. All-in, we are up about 11% year-to-date. Ex-electronics were up roughly about 3% organically. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Bruce. I will pass it on. Bruce Jermeland : Yes. Operator : [inaudible] Steve Tusa : Sorry, didn\u2019t come through very clearly. Can you hear me now? Bill Brown : Yes, we hear you, Steve. Steve Tusa : Sorry about that. Anurag, thanks, congratulations and looking forward to working with you here. Just wanted to delve into price a little bit more in this algorithm of productivity and gross margin, where does price play into that? And are you expecting to get back to that kind of a positive margin price cost spread going forward? Bill Brown : Well, it\u2019s a good question. I mean this year, we are seeing positive price. It\u2019s about half our organic growth, more or less, plus or minus 5% or thereabouts. We are covering material inflation this year. We are back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic level. It\u2019s a little bit higher than that in \u2013 during pandemic, because, obviously, inflation was spiking there. But as I step back on this, we should get pricing, particularly as we drive new product introductions and bring differentiated products into the marketplace. We do expect that. I see it in two pieces. I think one is we have an opportunity to get better at more surgical pricing, so pricing to volume generated. I made a comment last time that we\u2019ve got some opportunities to tie volume rebates, discounts, et cetera, to price. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working very, very hard on. as well as tightening down on what we call gross to net, and all the pieces between that volume discounts, market development funds, rebates, those kinds of things, that could be quite substantial. And I think we\u2019ve just had a better opportunity to get pricing. But as I look forward into next year, we should continue to be able to cover at least the material cost inflation in our price. Anurag Maheshwari : And just to add to \u2013 just to add to that, Steven, as Bill mentioned, our price should cover cost and inflation for us via inflation on the cost going forward. The one way to kind of think about the margin expansion moving forward, clearly, volume is the biggest driver for us in terms of operating leverage that we have, and the net productivity that we are driving. So, volume in that productivity should be the critical margin expansion drivers. Steve Tusa : And that you view price cost as separate from that productivity, I would assume? Anurag Maheshwari : Yes, correct. Steve Tusa : In the bridge? Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. Steve Tusa : So, then I am just wondering like if you got all of these kind of like good guys going your way and assuming like the economy doesn\u2019t like go to hell. What is the \u2013 like, R&D is flat, you should get SG&A leverage? You are talking about this productivity, price cost is not a headwind like what is the headwind to margins going forward? Like what\u2019s the negative? Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. So, the negative is essentially inflation that we will see over there, which is a wage inflation moving forward. But besides that, you shouldn\u2019t see anymore, of course, FX is there, which we don\u2019t know which way that could move. But if you look at overall margin even for the year, right, it\u2019s basically four pieces. It\u2019s a quarter of volume, a quarter of the restructuring cost, that \u2013 look, which came down lower compared to last year, it\u2019s a quarter of the TSA reimbursement and a quarter of net productivity. If you go into next year, there will be a little bit lower on the restructuring cost charges. But again, it\u2019s going to be more volume and it\u2019s going to be more on the productivity side with the biggest headwind being on inflation and potentially FX. It depends which way it goes. Steve Tusa : Sorry, one last one, how much is labor as a percentage of your costs again? Anurag Maheshwari : Labor as a percent of our cost is close to $10-ish billion, yes. $8 billion to $10 billion, yes. Steve Tusa : $8 billion to $10 billion, okay. Alright. Thanks a lot. Operator : We will go next now to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Could you give us a little more color into your consumer business? I think you talked about that it\u2019s getting a bit better. Could you elaborate on what you are seeing there is I think that business tends to be first-in first-out in the historical cycles. And I know you are focused on pricing in that segment, maybe that segment could be the most competitive in terms of pricing. Can you make the pricing improvement you need in that segment? Bill Brown : So, on consumer, we were down about 3% in the first half, down about 70 basis points in the third quarter. But keep in mind, it has about 230 basis points of headwind associated with some of the portfolio prioritization efforts that the team is working on. And if you go back Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and then head into Q4, it\u2019s becoming less negative in terms of organic growth and it\u2019s trending to perhaps be positive in the fourth quarter. For the full year, down low-single digits, for the overall, it\u2019s mostly a USAC business, a USAC retail business. So, USAC retail sales is down about 50 basis points, for the year, down about 80 basis points. So, it\u2019s sort of trending in that \u2013 in the line with where USAC retail sales happen to be. When you look at the parts of the portfolio in the quarter, we had pretty good growth in our Command Strips home improvement. The Command Strip business, that was up is partly due to some new product introductions in that space and that they are performing pretty well there. The other the parts of the portfolio were a bit weaker, were flat to down. So, they offset the positive trend in home improvement. But we see good improvement trends going into the fourth quarter. It all depends upon what happens in holiday season as we get through the next couple of months. But the trend line is moving up in terms of its organic growth rate. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful. And then Bill, maybe just stepping back, you have talked a lot about growth through innovation. But how far are you pushing 3M as to focus their innovation on maybe what I would call the right markets because it strikes me that there are just a few big global markets that are driving growth right now. Bill Brown : So, yes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about where we spend our precious $1 billion in R&D for sure, and making sure it\u2019s going after the right areas as part of our overall governance process and how we are developing our strategic plan. To focus on those markets where we have a right to win, where we can actually earn value, we have a strong return on investment in the spaces. And look, the team is pushing on this, and this is a big focus of mine, a big focus of the team. So, more to come on that, but it\u2019s certainly part of the lens and the calculus that we are looking at and where we are spending the \u2013 or investing our R&D dollars. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks. Operator : We will go next now to Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning all and welcome to Anurag. Just wanted to come back to the rationalization efforts, so I think it was a point of drag in the quarter, a point for the year, perhaps just isolating rationalization and leaving out some of the new product launches and other growth, should we be thinking about another point of headwind next year as you continue the simplification efforts, or is it something less as we proceed and advance forward here? Bill Brown : No, Brett, it should be declined substantially going into next year. I mean we will lap the year, so there will be a little bit of drag on effect for things that happen in the course of \u201824. But we shouldn\u2019t see significant headwind from portfolio or geographic prioritization going into next year. Our intention \u2013 Anurag haven\u2019t talked about this, but our intention would likely be to not speak so much about that in our \u201825 results. It\u2019s something that really people do companies do just at a normal practice as you continue to look at your portfolio. And you add something, you take some things out, you replace things. And I would expect that going into next year, to be less part of our conversation than this year. Brett Linzey : Alright. Makes sense. And then just a follow-up on NPA and the launching of the new products, 10% growth next year. Just wanted to better understand the associated costs and where those introductions are aimed at the segment level. Should we be thinking of a commensurate level of R&D step-up, or are you able to achieve this with repurposing the spending base? Bill Brown : No. So, it\u2019s within the existing spending base. As we go into \u201825, we will come back and talk more about where we see R&D. But a couple of things were happening. One is just it\u2019s a shift within where we spend our R&D. Really, it comes in kind of three buckets. I mean, it\u2019s about a third that goes into corporate research, longer term horizon things, basic technologies, there is kind of a third that\u2019s incremental line extensions, new product introductions. There is a third that that\u2019s going after cost reduction, PFAS fixes all those kinds of things. So, there is going to be some shift that\u2019s going on between those pieces. That middle bucket used to be around 40%, it dropped below 30%, that piece is coming back up. It\u2019s now above \u2013 it\u2019s now around a third around 32%, 33%. But that middle bucket on new products, new product line extensions is where we are shifting money to drive new product introductions. To be clear, the number of new product introductions this year in \u201824 is up 10% over last year, and we expect that, that 10% will accelerate in 2025 through those pieces I just mentioned a couple of minutes ago. The large part of our investment in new product introduction is going to be mostly in our safety and industrial business and transportation electronics business. There is some that goes into the consumer business. You will see more going into next year. You will see more introductions coming out of new product investment. But the lion\u2019s part of it is really in those other two businesses, and that\u2019s where a lot of the launches that I talked about a minute ago were occurring. We will share more information as we get into next year, not just the numbers, but where we are investing, what verticals we are investing, where we are going to prioritize our spend in the future and why, why we think we can win, and we will lay that out very clearly with investors as we get into February. Brett Linzey : Great. Congrats on the performance. Thank you. Operator : We will go next now to Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo Securities. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the operating equipment efficiency comments you made. And when you talked about 50% utilization, well short of best-in-class just in terms of any clarification of what kind of best-in-class would look like as well as what your targets are over, call it, the next 6 months or 12 months there? Bill Brown : Sure. Yes. Look, operating equipment efficiency is really \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamental metric. Companies that do manufacturing have implemented this over many, many years. It\u2019s a relatively new concept. We have 38 large factories, it\u2019s about 75% of our volume. And about 140 \u2013 about 80% of the assets that were in those factories, we implemented OEE. I mean you can implement it, but actually build it into the way the machine runs, it will take some time to do that. So, it\u2019s not a manual process, that\u2019s actually built into the way the machine runs. And look, if it\u2019s running 50%. The reality is we should be running, best-in-class companies are in 80% range or north of that. So, we are well short of that. So, the implication of this is that, first off, what\u2019s driving that underutilization, is it a lot of changeovers because that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s idled capacity, is it poor maintenance practices and the machine is down, is it volume or capacity, but it\u2019s sort of fundamental to figuring out how do you handle surge volume. And longer term, once that metric gets matured, and we come back and talk about a more holistic look at our network and the complexity we have in our network, it will allow us to say, well, where can we consolidate sites or cells or assets in our factories based on the utilization that happens to be out there. It\u2019s also more than theoretically possible, you were spending a capital for capacity expansion, yet, we are running 50% utilization on certain assets. So, longer term, we should also be looking at this as a way to make sure we are spending capital in the right places. So, it\u2019s really fundamental. We are started. We have got a metric \u2013 measure for where we have been year-to-date. And it will mature as we get into \u201825, probably it will be 80% done by as you get to the second quarter of next year. But it\u2019s a fundamental way of looking at how you are performing. And I am really proud of what the team has done in the last couple of months to drive that into our factories. Joe O\u2019Dea: And then also just wanted to ask on electronics demand trends, I think you commented that organically up high-single digits. So, earlier in the year, some spec in tailwinds, but it seems like still growing at a good clip as you move later into the year. And so any color there whether what you are seeing is trending with the market, if you are seeing any sort of share gain or taking advantage of pricing opportunities out there with the electronics growth. Bill Brown : Yes. So, the electronics was up pretty good. Year-to-date in the quarter, we did have some back-end wins. I think we are growing at slightly higher than the market. We are watching pretty carefully what happens in the holiday trends here and what happens in the fourth quarter going into next year. So, we are pretty pleased with where we have been so far. It comes from a lot of the sophisticated films that we have created that are going into a variety of electronic devices. They are very sophisticated things, multilayer optical films optical adhesives, things that allow LCDs to look like OLEDs in terms of screen performance, gives you privacy and other things that you can then extend into the larger screens, larger displays in cars. That\u2019s what drives our Auto-E business. So, it\u2019s a pretty important technology. It\u2019s allowing us to perform well in electronics as a whole. So, we like the trends. We are watching what happens in the holiday season, and we will see what happens going into next year. So, doing pretty well, actually in semiconductors as well, it\u2019s \u2013 we are growing way above the market. That\u2019s been a pretty important trend for us this year, doing pretty well in data center, is not a big part of our business at the moment, but pretty pleased with that. But specific to electronics, outgrowing the market, and it\u2019s because of the spec-in wins and technology we have. Joe O\u2019Dea: Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone and welcome, Anurag. Bill, I think you mentioned earlier that you were honing in on redesigning your forecasting and demand planning across, I think two of your businesses. I am just curious like what are some kind of initial thoughts on improvements you think you can make? And then why not focus a little bit more holistically across the entire portfolio at this point? Bill Brown : Well, this will eventually go across the entire portfolio. But like stepping back, we are sitting there where we are not delivering to where we want to be on-time and full to customers. We are proud of where it\u2019s gotten too, but it\u2019s not where it needs to be. So, we have got \u2013 we are not delivering on-time, yet we are sitting on 100 days of inventory at the same time. And so how do you fix this, and we are looking at the assets in our factories, on average and the ones we are measuring at running at roughly 50% utilization across the largest ones. And you run that calculus and there is something wrong in this whole value chain. And then go back to supplier. Supplier is delivering on-time and full to us. We are running in the low-60s now in the low-70s, but that there is a ring, it\u2019s an average. So, it\u2019s below 50% to up to 80%. And what\u2019s happening is it\u2019s just how you manage the flow through that supply chain. And it starts with the front end of it. It starts with the demand signal. So, what are we using to tell the factory what to produce at a SKU level, and then how does that translate based on stock on hand to what you tell the suppliers to do based on their OTIF performance, the lead time on logistics. This whole chain has to work incredibly smoothly because it\u2019s very complicated. So, it really comes back to this fundamental of what is that forecast demand signal. And the reality is, as we dug into it in a couple of divisions where we struggled with on-time and full, our forecast accuracy is not very good. So, there are analytical tools that are available that we are starting to look at. It takes some time to implement them. You have got a data cleanse, you have got to look at what are the right parameters you ought to be building into the model. Is there a manual overlay or not based on unique circumstances having for a SKU. That whole process has to run well. And if your forecast accuracy is not good, you cannot run your factory very well. Your inventory will be high, your suppliers won\u2019t perform, your logistics providers won\u2019t be available. So, it has to run like a smooth running clock. And it\u2019s clearly, we have opportunity to do better here. As we refine the model, yes, we will roll that out through the rest of the business, as appropriate. But this is really looking at two big divisions where we need, really high degree of focus early on. So, it will roll out over time as we get success here. Joe Ritchie : Yes. That\u2019s super helpful, Bill, in detail. I am curious, do you think that by February, you will have some kind of sense for what type of opportunity this presents for the organization? Bill Brown : Yes. Look, we will certainly know by February, the results of the couple of divisions, were in there big divisions, not like small pieces. But we can estimate from that, we could probably estimate what\u2019s going to happen as we roll it out to other divisions. So, yes, we can sort of lay out a lot more, where I think you want to go, which is it\u2019s nice to talk about forecast accuracy, but tell me a little bit about how it\u2019s going to affect delivery performance, cost performance, inventory level. And I think we can kind of connect the dots on this as we get further mature in this particular area, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Good. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Chris Snyder : Thanks for getting me in here. Bill, on the last call, you talked about how you believe the business should be growing in excess of GDP. And I think to a prior question, you talked about better growth maybe into the back half of \u201825 and into \u201826. So, is that just simply a function of the investments that you guys are making in innovation that\u2019s going to allow you to start outgrowing the end market and it just takes time, or is there also an assumption that maybe the consumer just the served end markets get better into the back half of \u201825 as we kind of see that pickup in growth? Bill Brown : So, Chris, our crystal ball is not going to be any better than what the various prognosticators out there are looking at in terms of what happens with industrial production, GDP, consumer behavior. I look back at the end of last year for what was predicted on IPI this year, and I think it was predicted 1.7, 1.2. So, I am not sure these indicators are all that powerful to predict what might happen in the market or the macro year out or 1.5 years out. Look, first off, we got to grow with the market, and I think we are doing a good job with doing that, in this year at about 1%. As I said last time, and I think at your conference, the 1% is not where we want to be, to actually grow that and be performing better. Without putting a timeframe on it, it comes into these two levers. One, we have got to get this R&D machine running. As I mentioned then, I will say it again today. That\u2019s going to take time. Our development time \u2013 our development cycle is a year or more on developing and commercializing launching a new product. So, there is a timeframe that that\u2019s going to take to turn that piece around. But there are some initiatives that we have got to get at today, and that\u2019s a lot more aggressive this at the customer interface, selling, pricing, these other things, which has a near-term effect. When you put all that stuff together, is it growing at GDP or more than that, we will describe that more over time. I want to sort of walk before I run here and that\u2019s kind of where I am standing as we speak today, Chris. Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. And just to add, right, we have grown three quarters consistently 1%. As Bill said, we will give more color as time goes by over there. To Steve\u2019s question earlier, we said we can grow operating margin at a pretty healthy clip given all the levers we have. As we go into next year, as you are aware, we do certain headwinds from higher pension expense, lower interest income. Of course, we mitigate that through share repurchase, but that\u2019s a $0.30 headwind that we see from below the line items. But if I kind of look at what\u2019s we have driving in terms of all the discussion we just had around the factory, the supply chain, looking at the indirect cost and all the productivity along with that, along with the tailwind, we can see with the reduction in restructuring charges. It gives us confidence to expand operating margins next year while driving top line growth, and we will give more specific details this year. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. And then if I could just follow-up on maybe some of the portfolio pruning. Is it fair to assume that whatever business the company decides to leave, they will get paid for it? Not \u2013 no more organic exit or at least nothing very sizable in terms of organic exit? I understand maybe certain SKUs or product lines can come and go. Bill Brown : Yes. Look, I think there is going to be, over time, natural portfolio pruning in terms of SKUs. As you bring new products on, it may obsolete other things that need to go out. That churn, that part of \u2013 that\u2019s a normal part of business, and that should all be sort of absorbed within your normal organic growth contributions that we should be growing at the market for. So, that is \u2013 as you just pointed out, Chris, a distinct from a selling business, which we are going to look at that\u2019s on an inorganic exit. We will look hard at cash effects, dilution effects, all those pieces. We will make sure we get paid more value for that business than we would have assumed today within 3M. But I think your question was really on organic. And as I turn this year, like I said, I think we will probably talk less about kind of the portfolio shifting that going all up inside the company on SKUs and geographies and things like that, so. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting in, and welcome to Anurag. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you. Deane Dray : This came up in the local paper, but it would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the challenges you are facing, both operationally and culturally, to get the 3M employees back to the office. You all have been fully remote for longer than most companies. I know you have announced some initiatives, but would love to hear some color there. Bill Brown : Well, so look, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we need to grow our business. We need to innovate. Part of that is, we need to solve problems for customers. I do think that your problem solved, innovate better in person. We are going to maintain flexibility in our workforce. What we have done is for our largest sites at our most senior people, we have asked those individuals to be on the site wherever they report on Tuesday through Thursday with some flexibility on Monday and Friday. This is an opportunity for us to continue to build our culture, build our relationships, problem solved as a team. And I think it\u2019s the right step. I know a lot of our customers have moved in this direction in the past. Maintaining some flexibility in our workforce is really important to me. It\u2019s important to our employees, and we are allowing that. But it gives us an opportunity to be able to look across the table from one another and really dig in and problem solved in a better way than I think you can over Teams or Zoom or some other format like that. So, that\u2019s why we are leaning in a little bit more on bringing people back at sort of \u2013 at our larger sites including here at 3M Center. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just a last question, a lot of discussions today about new product introductions, efficiencies in R&D, will you be bringing back the new product vitality index? Is that one of the measures and 3M had at one time, but then went away from it? What\u2019s your thought there? Bill Brown : No, I am happy to talk about it. I know there was reasons why we pulled away from it. We don\u2019t want to get that to be oversold or built into a comp metric or whatever. But the reality is it\u2019s an important metric, because we have pulled back from introducing new products to the marketplace, we know that. I talked at some detail as to how many NPIs have come down over time and where we are at last year, going up 10% this year. The net effect of that is our product portfolio in the marketplace is aging, for sure. Our NPVI on a 5-year basis is running just over double digits, 10%, 11%. We used to be 25%, 30% for the more super innovative companies that are in that range. I am not going to say when we get back there, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s on my mind. We need to have more fresh offerings on the marketplace, so we ought to be better than low double digit in terms of Vitality Index. And I am happy to talk about that over time in terms of the metric, what\u2019s happening to it, why I think it\u2019s important. But I don\u2019t want to overuse it with investors or here with employees because there is lots of other metrics, of measures that drives are we becoming effective at driving innovation in the company. That just happens to be one of them. Deane Dray : Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments. Bill Brown : Well, thank you very much to all of the analysts for joining today and asking a number of very, very good questions. I want to importantly thank all 3M-ers for their dedication, their hard work on behalf of our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter, throughout the year, and I look forward to speaking with all of the investors as we get into late January issue our Q4 results, and in late February, probably the last week of February as we host an Investor Day likely here in Minneapolis. Have a very good day, everybody. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, January 21, 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Chinmay Trivedi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis at 3M. Chinmay Trivedi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Anurag Maheshwari, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Anurag will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2, and take a moment to read the forward-looking statements. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I will hand the call off to Bill. Bill? Bill Brown : Thank you, Chinmay, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I'd like to welcome Chinmay to his first earnings call as the Head of Investor Relations. He has been with 3M for three years, leading the FP&A function, and was with GE before joining 3M. He's replacing Bruce Jermeland who retired on January 1. Bruce led IR for the last six years and was with 3M for more than two decades, and we wish him well in his retirement. 2024 was a pivotal year for 3M. Earlier in the year, we spun off our Healthcare Business Group as Solventum and we settled two significant legal matters. We also substantially completed the largest restructuring program in company history, which focused on reducing complexity and improving margins. These changes weren't easy, but the team has done a terrific, job executing the programs and the results are showing up in our financial performance. This relentless focus on operational execution drove a strong finish to the year. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.68 on 2.1% organic revenue growth. The company generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion with conversion of 145%. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. These results capped a strong year for the company where we delivered $7.30 in adjusted earnings per share at the high end of our guidance and up 21% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1.2% and we generated $4.9 billion in free cash flow with a conversion rate of 111%. Turning to Slide 4. The fourth quarter results reflect our focus on the fundamentals. Each business group drove positive adjusted organic growth. The first time in nine quarters that all business groups grew together and it was broad-based. 12 of our 16 divisions posted positive growth compared to only seven in the first quarter. One of the fundamentals is commercial execution, and we're beginning to make progress in this area. For example, in Safety & Industrial, we launched a campaign to drive cross-selling at our channel partners with some encouraging early results. And this year, we pulled forward the quota-setting process for our sales force to ensure we get out of the gates quickly and we instituted standard work for our sales managers and area leaders who support our frontline sales reps. Reinvigorating the innovation engine is critical to sustain this top-line momentum. In 2024, we launched 169 new products, up 32% over the prior year. This was above expectations due in part to the rigor and governance we've put in place around new product introductions, but more importantly, to the enthusiasm of the team to get back to innovating for our customers. One launch we're particularly excited about is our LCD 2.0 platform program that enables LCD displays for tablets, notebooks and monitors to achieve the brightness and contrast similar to OLED, combining our multilayer optical film technology with our microreplication technology. Another one is our Expanded Beam Optics or EBO connector, which is an optical interconnect designed for data centers that reduces installation time, cleaning, and maintenance while delivering exceptional performance. But we're still in the early days of our R&D turnaround effort. NPI is clearly an important metric. And in 2025, we expect to see a double-digit increase in the number of launches on top of the higher performance in '24, but it's just one of several we're tracking. Over time, we need to work to shorten the development cycle time to increase launch cadence, focus investment dollars on higher octane programs and see NPI translate into higher sales and margins. Also critical to driving growth is improving service, and a key metric for us is on-time, in-full or OTIF. OTIF was 88% for the year, up 3 percentage points versus last year and 8 points versus 2022. Our team has made solid progress, but we have more work to do. While Consumer and Transportation & Electronics are now consistently delivering to their customers at over 90% on time, our performance in Safety & Industrial remains well below expectations in the low 80s. It will take a fundamental shift in our approach to raise service levels to where they need to be. And we're doing this by standardizing the demand planning process, using new algorithms to improve forecast accuracy, improving supplier delivery performance, and driving consistency and reliability in logistics. These are key elements of our broader operational excellence program which continues to mature but is still in the early innings. Our goal remains to deliver 2% net productivity through sourcing efficiency, quality improvement, lean manufacturing and asset utilization, which I described last time as Operating Equipment Efficiency or OEE. These efforts are starting to take hold and will support further gross margin expansion toward our goal of high 40s. We also made progress on inventory days, which was down 2 days versus last year and 8 sequentially, ending the year at 94 days. This is just the start as our goal is to get to 75 days, freeing up cash for our capital deployment priorities, which include returning cash to shareholders. Last year, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders, $2 billion in dividends, and $1.8 billion in share repurchases. Lastly, we continue to assess our portfolio, and we have several small actions underway. We'll update you on progress as deals are signed. Moving to guidance on Slide 5. Our strong finish in the fourth quarter gives us confidence in our ability to deliver in 2025. For the year, we expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 3%, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $7.90, and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%. Our back-to-basics approach and focus on our three top priorities underpins our ability to deliver on these commitments as the macro recovery continues to be uneven. Currently, IPI is forecasted to be 1.9% in 2025. But as you may recall, the forecast for IPI in 2024, 12 months ago, was also about 2%, and we ended the year at about 1%. We'll see how that revolves, but we'll be looking to take advantage of this acceleration as it materializes. Other key data points to watch include auto builds, which are expected to be slightly negative, but down 3% to 4% in Europe and the U.S., where we have better penetration and flat in China and up across Asia, where our content per vehicle is lower. Consumer electronics is expected to be up low to mid-single digits and consumer discretionary spend remains soft, especially in the U.S. where retail sales are expected to be relatively flat. As we navigate the ups and downs of the macro-environment, we'll focus as always on what we can control, servicing our customers at higher levels, improving commercial excellence at the customer interface, filling up the innovation pipeline to support future growth, and driving productivity and efficiency throughout the organization. We look forward to sharing more details on each of these priorities as well as our medium-term outlook during our Investor Day in St. Paul on February '26. You'll hear from our leaders in R&D, supply-chain and the business groups about their execution plans that will turn our priorities into results. I hope to see you there. With that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to walk through the details of the quarter. Anurag? Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Bill. Turning to Slide 6. We had a strong finish to the year with Q4 performance coming in better than expected. Total adjusted sales were $5.8 billion with organic growth up 2.1%. All three business groups had positive adjusted organic growth in the quarter and performed better than our end markets. In the fourth quarter, global IPI was up 1.4% year-on-year and the markets we serve trended in line with expectations. Consumer electronics remained stable, automotive OEM builds were flat and consumer retail discretionary spending was soft. Geographically, our growth was led by China, up high-single-digits, driven by our electronics business where we continue to gain share and saw modest front-loading from an anticipated change in tariffs. The U.S. was up low-single digits despite the challenging macro backdrop with growth in Aerospace and general industrial. And EMEA was down low-single digits due to the continued weak environment, including a high single-digit decline in auto builds. Adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $1.68 or $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance. The better performance was driven by $0.09 of volume leverage, higher productivity, and lower restructuring charges, more than offsetting the unexpected $0.04 headwind from FX due to the significant recent U.S. dollar strength. I will provide a quick overview of our growth performance for each business group on Slide 7. Safety & Industrial organic sales grew for the third consecutive quarter with 2.4% growth in the fourth quarter. This growth was broad-based with six out of seven divisions posting positive growth. We saw particularly strong demand for eBonding in electronics and hearing and body protection in personal safety. In addition, growth was driven from a large few power grid orders as anticipated in Asia and the U.S. for aluminum high-capacity conductors and power cable accessories for data centers. For the year, Safety & Industrial sales were approximately $11 billion with organic sales growth of 0.7%, led by strength in eBonding, cable accessories, and auto body repair. Roofing granules had another year of mid-single-digit growth as we continue to capitalize on the multi-year roof replacement cycle. Transportation & Electronic adjusted sales were up 2% organically in the fourth quarter. The consumer electronics business showed continued strength, growing high-single-digits, driven by solid volumes through the holiday season and continued share gains. Aerospace was again up double-digits in the quarter, while the auto OEM business was down mid-single digits, reflecting continued weakness in global car and light truck builds. For the year, Transportation & Electronics had adjusted organic growth of 3.4%, driven by electronics, aerospace, and auto. Our electronics sales were up approximately 12% from strong market demand, combined with new product introductions and spec wins that drove share gains. Despite a challenging Q4, our auto OEM business was up 2% versus a 1% decline in auto build rates. And the Aerospace business grew double-digits again for the year and 50% over the past two years, reflecting our focus on growth portfolios. Finally, the Consumer business returned to growth in the fourth quarter, up 1.2% organically. Home improvement led the way up low-single digits, driven by strength during the holiday season for Command, Scotch Tapes, and Paint Protection products. And for the year, our Consumer business was down 1.2% with low single-digit growth in home improvement sales, mainly Command, more than offset by low to mid-single-digit declines in the other divisions. Let me summarize our full year 2024 financial performance on Slide 8. On the back of strong fourth quarter performance, we finished the year with total adjusted sales of $23.6 billion and organic growth of 1.2%. All of our business groups were in line with our guidance and from a geographic perspective, we saw solid organic growth in Asia Pacific, up 4.4%, driven by consistent strength in our electronics business. In the U.S., despite IPI being down 0.3%, our business was up 0.7% driven by electrical markets, aerospace, cable accessories, and home improvement. EMEA was down 1.3% due to the decline in auto builds and the weak industrial and manufacturing environment. Our adjusted operating margins expanded 280 basis points, above the high-end of our guidance range of 250 to 275 basis points to 21.4%. This performance was driven by benefits from volume leverage, productivity, Solventum transition service agreement, cost reimbursements, and restructuring, partially offset by FX and investments to drive growth in the business. We delivered $7.30 of EPS for the year, up 21% and at the high end of our guidance range. Over 80% of our year-on-year performance was driven by strong operational execution. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $4.9 billion or 111% conversion which included net working capital improvement of 8 days and returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2024. Please turn to Slide 9, as we look into our 2025 guidance. As Bill indicated, we expect organic sales growth of 2% to 3%, earnings per share of $7.60 to $7.90, representing growth of 4% to 8%, and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, all on an adjusted basis. We expect all business groups to grow low-single digits, which is in line with or above macro. We expect this higher-growth trajectory to be supported by a focus on commercial excellence, improvement in service levels, and new product launches. We have largely moved past product portfolio prioritization headwinds and the small amount that remains is incorporated into our guidance and won't be specifically called out going forward. Our EPS growth is anchored by margin expansion in the range of 130 basis points to 190 basis points which reflects our relentless focus on operational excellence. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 100%, driven by strong operating income growth and a focus on working capital management. Adjusted CapEx of approximately $1 billion will be in line with depreciation and amortization. Let me take a minute to walk through the EPS drivers for 2025 on Slide 10. We expect EPS growth of 4% to 8%, driven by operational performance that is partially offset by non-operational headwinds. We are confident that our focus on operational excellence will contribute $0.70 to $1 or 10% to 14% to adjusted EPS growth. This growth will come from volume, restructuring, and net productivity, more than offsetting growth investments and stranded costs. We expect non-op headwinds of approximately $0.40, half from FX due to recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the other half from below the line items, including pension expense, net interest, and tax, partially offset by share buyback. We plan for our gross share repurchase program in '25 to be approximately $1.5 billion. Putting all this together, we expect strong operating performance and capital deployment to drive EPS growth. As we think about the cadence through the year, we expect sales and EPS to be split equally between the first and second half, in line with historical trends. Within the first half, we expect Q1 sales growth to be similar to Q4 and earnings will reflect the annual equity grants, which last year were deferred to Q2. This will result in Q1 earnings being similar to that of last year and we expect sequential improvement into Q2 as we lap the Solventum spin items with earnings being approximately equal between the two halves. I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the strong finish to the year and I'm confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in 2025 with growth acceleration, strong margin expansion and return cash to our shareholders in excess of $3 billion. With that, let's open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, Bill and Anurag. Hi, just on the top-line in particular, so I was wondering if you could give us a sense of to what degree sort of the operational execution -- product development has actually impacted the top-line already versus what you expect to kind of play out in 2025. Just thinking on some of these product launches and the like came later in the year. So perhaps we could start there. Bill Brown : So, good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Yes, we were very pleased with the acceleration of new product introductions, as I mentioned in my remarks, came in above expectations, in fact, quite a bit above the expectations. But still very early. A lot of the products that we're launching are what we call Class III, so they're incremental. So year one sales on these products are going to be somewhat light and it will grow over time over the next several years. More importantly, as we grow our NPI launches next year by double-digit, we shift to more what I call higher octane or Class IV type products, which have more sales capability. We'd likely see more impact on the top-line from these launches. It's an important dimension. I think the team has built momentum. It's part of the governance process. It's a lot of -- it's the enthusiasm, the team. Some of it is shifting some resources around. We added 50 people in Q4 and we moved about another 100 people into R&D development in the quarter. So we're on the right track. This is a good sign. We've got to see it turn into a reasonable and substantial margin and income over time. But whatever we've seen in terms of launches, is built into the two to three guidance we see next year. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then maybe just one for Anurag. A lot of conversation last year as we were all trying to fine-tune our models on kind of the restructuring versus stranded costs and the like, just wonder within that $0.70 to $1 -- $0.70 to $1 bridge item, Anurag, you could give us a little bit of granularity on restructuring investments and stranded costs in particular. Anurag Maheshwari : Okay. Good morning, Jeff. Sure. Let me do that. And probably what I'll do is I'll break the pieces to the bridge. Yes. So at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we are growing 10% to 14%, excluding the non-op items, which is quite strong relative to the midpoint of organic growth. So there are three factors for that. One of them is sales volume, which creates significant volume leverage as well as incrementals. So a 2.5% volume growth at the midpoint of the guidance and 35% incrementals, that's about $200 million or so. Second is the lower restructuring cost to your specific question. That's about $200 million tailwind into '25. So that's another $200 million. And finally, on the net productivity, that's about $150 million as well. And lots of pieces in that. The PFAS stranded cost is a -- is negative $100 million. We're making some growth investments as well, but offsetting that is overall net productivity through the factories, through our SG&A function as well. So you put all the three buckets together, it's about $550 million of margin improvement. FX is offsetting about $125 million of that or so. So the $425 million is at about -- at the midpoint about 160 basis points of margin expansion. So those are the three big pieces driving the operational growth of $0.70 to $1. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you for that. I'll pass the line. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning. Good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : And thanks for the shorter presentation too. Hi, Bill, you mentioned the quota pull forward. I think you mentioned something about some changes in the sales organization. But if we just back up a little bit, what -- perhaps you could just frame kind of what you're trying to change with the sales organization and maybe a little bit more detail on what exactly does that mean when you talk about a quota pull-forward or as far as trying to drive growth? Bill Brown : Yes. So it's a great question. Thank you for that. When I laid out the original plan around driving top-line growth. It -- the basis is around driving more innovation and that's going to take time and I commented on that a little while before. Growth in the near term is going to come from selling more what we have on the market today. And that's an important dimension to this, which is just a more aggressiveness in our frontline sales and marketing resources. They're dealing with right now with not a lot of new things to say to the customers because we haven't been innovating as much. And our on-time, in-full performance out of the factories has not been that great. It's improving, but it has not been that great. So the sales force is challenged in some ways to sell and I think they've been on their back feet in some ways. And I think what Chris and the team at SIBG and others across the company are doing is really leaning into this. So what we're trying to push for is making sure that the sales leaders, the sales reps out in the field, they know what they're expected to do in 2025 early in the year. So that's -- they're getting out of gates January 1 with our quota, their targets specific things around closed one wins. Typically, that would have been in early April when it rolls out. So a little bit lag. So that's why Q1 might not have had some momentum. A little more structure around how the sales managers and area leaders are working in terms of their cadence, reviewing the progress with their sales reps, that's quite important. Some of the other dimensions that we're pushing on here is around cross-selling. We -- it's a pilot. It's six combination pairs that we've done, six or eight different distributors. So it's small pieces here. But in December, we saw some pretty good momentum building. And I'm pretty optimistic that over this year and next that there's going to be some benefits for cross-selling. We're working on pricing and reinstituting some price corridors and changing our governance process on pricing. So when you step back, I think all of this gets back to the original premise was -- we've got to get better at selling what we have today on the marketplace. And that's where the back-end of '24 and then most of '25 is going to come from, which is why I think it's important to investors to understand that piece. The NPI will come over time. I'm very confident about that, but we've got to get better at selling more what we have on the market today. Scott Davis : Makes sense, Bill. And just -- I think -- when you talk about on-time, in-full, it seems very fundamental. But in theory, if you had 100% on-time, in-full, would your growth rate be 100 basis points higher, 200 basis points higher? Is there any way to kind of narrow that down? Bill Brown : Yes, it's hard to quantify, Scott, it's a good question. Clearly running at 88% is not where we need to be. We're feeling -- we're running around 93%, a little over 93% in Consumer. We should be in the high 90s. That's the expectation of some of the big-box retailers. So we're getting there. We're doing better there. We're over 90% in the Transportation business. That's good. It should be better. The concern really is in SIBG, the Safety & Industrial business in the low 80s. We're definitely losing business for sure there. We are not delivering. When somebody needs something right now and we don't have it available, that is causing them to go someplace else, even though we have a better brand, sometimes a better product, and attractive price. So it is costing us sales. So I do know that as a fundamental part of driving top-line, we've got to get better at exercising the supply chain and making sure we meet our customers' expectations. Scott Davis : Okay. Best of luck. Thank you, guys. Bill Brown : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So -- morning. Bill, so you sound a little skeptical about the 1.9% IPI forecast just based on that's where we were this time last year. So I'm just wondering when you went through the plan process, looked at the bottoms-up kind of projections from the businesses, and then you overlay that with the top-down, what kind of haircuts have you taken to that 1.9%? And then that brings me on to my next question, well, the real question I guess. What have you baked in for pricing in 2025? And then just going forward, what is the sort of framework here? Is it IPI plus price? Is it IPI multiplied by some kind of factor plus price? I mean, any way to think about that growth function going forward? Bill Brown : So it's a good question. I don't think we're going to deconstruct the elements of growth between price and volume and share gain and other parts of it. But look, we did enter '24 with an expectation IPI was going to be a bit better and it softened through the year. There was an expectation of auto builds and that softened quite a bit in the back-end of the year. As we were three months ago, thinking about IPI in 2025, it was higher than we actually are sitting at today, it was on 2.4%. The auto-build was at that point in time higher expectation for '25 than we sit here today. So these indicators, they're just that. They're indicators and we use them. It's an important dimension, but it's sort of a starting point. We -- of course, we've done a bottoms-up review of our business. We feel confident that 2% to 3% is the right place to be. When you look at a blended macro between IPI and GDP because we're about 80% weighted to IPI, 20% to GDP, it's around 2.1%. So the center point at 2.5% is a little bit above the macro. We know that some of the initiatives we're putting in place around commercial execution, new product development, getting our factories run a bit better, those are all very important dimensions. But Nigel, again, it's -- we're two, three weeks into the year. We've got a new administration in Washington. There's lots of conversations floating around tariffs. We'll see as the year goes by, both progress and traction of some of the initiatives we have internally plus what happens in the macro and we'll update investors accordingly. So right now, we feel good about 2% to 3% is the right place to start in '25. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Bill. And then, Anurag, for you. Thanks for the details on the margin bridge. The $150 million of net productivity, that appears to be mainly the payback on the restructuring actions in 2024. So I'm just wondering if there's anything from some of the more structural drivers such as improving -- ultimately improving footprint, supply-chain, et cetera? Anurag Maheshwari : There is. So let me break up the $150 million in a little bit more detail, yes. So first, just on the headwinds over there. So I said it was $100 million of stranded costs. The incremental investments we are making as well, which is about $225 million, some we did in '24, some in '25. It's both a carryover as well as in-year. So if add the two together, it's about $325-ish, $350 million. Now offsetting that, you're correct, there is probably $70 million of restructuring benefits, about $280 million. But then to get to the positive $150 million, we're driving about more than $400 million of net productivity. And that is coming through again through supply-chain, be it procurement, more on the G&A efficiency and a few of the other areas that Bill has spoken about. So overall, I would say the productivity driving is $450 million, just being offset by all these other line items to get us to $150 million. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bill, you had mentioned in the Conference Circuit in December that you saw a bit of an uptick in industrial demand in Q4. Did that continue into January here? Do you think it was just related to pre-buy ahead of tariffs? Or could it have been a reflection of maybe some modest recovery in short-cycle markets? How would you characterize it? Bill Brown : Yes. So we did see, I'd say, across the industrial part of the portfolio, not referring to the Consumer side, but the industrial part of the portfolio. We did see order rates, first of all, they were very steady through the quarter which I think was very positive. They were a tick higher than they were in Q3. The order rates were somewhat higher than the growth rate -- organic growth rate in the quarter. So there's a bit of backlog that was built into 2025. Those are all good indicators. But we are a shorter-cycle business. So we don't really live off backlog. It's more of a book-and-ship type business. But there's small little indicators. It was pretty broad-based. There was no specific region or business that was the driver of it. That also is somewhat encouraging. Again, it's -- and I contrast that to where we were in Q4 of '23, where I think there was a pretty dramatic tail-off in orders towards the back end of December, which got the team a little bit shaken in some ways. We did not see that happen here. So those are all good indicators, which is why when we look at 2%, 2.1% organic growth in Q4, that we feel that that's a good floor, if you will, for 2025. But I think it's good news. It's holding steady. And again, it's a reflection of some modestly improvements in the industrial markets. But again, it's kind of early days. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful. And then Anurag, can you give more color into '25 margin guidance by segment? And then also comment on T&E margin particularly in Q4 '24 as it seemed a little weak in Q4 versus the other segments. Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. So first, let me talk about Q4 and then I'll get into '25. So overall, our Q4 came in better than expected across, from our expectations what we gave in the October guide, across all the three segments. Yes? And as I noted in my prepared comments, it's probably $0.05 higher than what our midpoint of our guide was because of volume and productivity with FX being the big headwind in the quarter, which was unexpected. Now on TEBG, we did expect the margins to be lower in Q4 seasonally one -- of course, between Q3 and Q4 because of under-absorption as we clear out inventory. So that was a big reason. And if you look between Q3 and Q4, sequentially, we improved inventory by 8 days. So that clearly has an absorption issue. Second is, we started making growth investments, which we are seeing in the revenue right now. That was a driver for it. And FX, if you -- TEBG does have a fair amount of business outside the U.S. so that impacts it as well. So you put all these three things together, the margin is lower. It actually came in better than what we expected. So overall, if I look at all the three business groups for '24, the margins came in a little bit better than expected. As we go into '25, we're probably not giving guidance right now very specific to each of the segments. But the 130 basis points to 190 basis points range that we gave in terms of margin expansion, we expect all the three business groups to grow a -- quite a bit. The TEBG could be a little bit lighter than the other two because of the PFAS stranded costs, a large part of it is in TEBG. But having said that, we expect good margin expansion across all the three business groups. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. Thank you. Bill Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question, trying to understand the sort of operating margin expansion framework. So you talked about, I think, Anurag, $450 million of overall productivity improvement in 2025. In the past or recent past, let's say, Bill, you've talked about that sort of $250 million, $260 million COGS productivity number, so as a sort of annual placeholder. So just trying to understand the kind of delta between that. I'm guessing $450 million is not a medium-term placeholder because you have some extra savings this year from the 2023 plan. But maybe just help us understand sort of how to think about productivity on top of that 35% core leverage placeholder. Bill Brown : Sure. So, Julian, you're correct. What we have said is on the COGS line, 2% net productivity, which is about $250 million. The productivity, which I'm talking about is overall for the company, which also includes SG&A, other parts of the business as well. It also has one quarter of the TSA reimbursement, which overlaps over there too, right? So if you -- so those are the pieces, which takes us to $450 million. I mean, we'll provide more on the Investor Day in terms of the framework looking forward. But I think our goal is still to get 2% net productivity in COGS and for even on SG&A line to see whatever productivity we can get to offset inflation and other investments that we are making. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. And I'll leave other medium-term questions for that event. So maybe just on the very short-term, Anurag. I think you had mentioned sort of 1.70-ish of EPS adjusted in Q1. The first half is just under $4, though I think based on that 50% comment. So you got a decent sequential step-up in the second quarter in EPS. Maybe just any very large puts and takes. It seems like organic growth pretty steady year-on-year, but anything you're calling out the sort of Q1 to Q2 delta? Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me break it on the two parts. One is some discrete items in the first quarter. And then second is on the recurring operational performance and non-op impact, which you should see through the year. On the discrete items, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, due to the Solventum spin, there were few pieces, but a large part of it was the equity-based compensation, which I called out last year. We accrued in the second quarter. And as this year as we're returning back to historical trends, we'll be accruing it in the first quarter. This is about a $0.15 headwind in the first quarter, which becomes a tailwind in the second quarter. On the operational side, we'll see good flow-through from volume, lower restructuring costs, TSA absorption, all the productivity that we spoke about, which will offset PFAS stranded and mix headwind, and also all the growth investment. So there should be about $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS growth in the quarter. On the non-op, we have $0.40 for the year. So the first quarter is probably going to be closer to $0.08 to $0.10. So if you put all these items together, Julian, you've got $0.20, $0.25 of operational EPS growth. You minus the $0.8 to $0.10 of non-op and the $0.15 of equity-based comp, so the earnings are flat to Q1 of last year. Now as you move into the second quarter, if we continue the similar trajectory on operating performance and the non-op headwind, it will be $0.10, $0.15 of EPS growth. And then you add back the $0.15 of the equity-based compensation. So the growth in Q2 would be closer to $0.25, $0.30. So that's the bridge between Q1 and Q2. And then to your math, the first half and second half should be fairly equal in terms of EPS. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Bill Brown : Hi, good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk a little bit about -- I'm not sure you mentioned it before, but the price assumption for this year? Bill Brown : No, we've not talked about that. I don't think we're going to disaggregate organic growth. It's embedded in the 2% to 3%. I think as we said before in the past, we do get price increases. The price increases cover material cost inflation and I expect it to be in a similar magnitude in '25. But we're not going to sort of give that specific number here today. Steve Tusa : And is that a net positive or you're just -- you're just covering it? Bill Brown : No, it will be a net positive in this year. Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just to -- one follow-up on the T&E segment in the fourth quarter. Margin was a little bit weaker than we were expecting. Anything in particular going on there in the fourth? Anurag Maheshwari : No, in fact, as I mentioned earlier, Steve, it's probably a little bit better than expected, nothing unusual. This is -- it's a combination of seasonality as you bring inventory down, some growth investments we made. But as you move into '25, you should see margin expansion again in TEBG. TEBG was actually our highest-margin expansion segment in '24 by growing over 220 basis points. So I would say nothing unusual in the fourth quarter, just timing of different things. Steve Tusa : And then sorry, one more. Just on the corporate side, a little bit lower in expense this year. How does that look going forward? Is that a sustainable number in the model going forward into '26, '27, the corporate side? Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. We'll talk about '25 right now for, Steve. Just -- on '25, two pieces over there. Both equal halves, it's about $60 million each. One is just a reallocation between corporate and the business group. It's one last quarter of overlap over there because we did it for nine months of the year. So one is just the reallocation and the second is covering the TSA absorption costs about $60 million. So those are the only two pieces in corporate. Steve Tusa : Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Bill Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. How are you? Bill Brown : Good, Andrew. Good morning. Andrew Obin : Yes, can we just talk about free cash flow? Good improvement in free cash flow conversion this year. As we think about next year, this squiggler line 100% free cash flow conversion. What kind of working capital benefit do you have dialed in? And what are their offsets in terms of cash flow or cash flow to keep it at 100% because you do have working capital release program and I would have expected that you could deliver over 100% quite sustainably for a number of years. Anurag Maheshwari : Yes. Hi, thanks for the question. Yes, we did very well in '24 as you could see 111% conversion, very good on the working capital as well where we improved the cash conversion cycle by 8 days. It's early days right now in '25. Reason we put 100% conversion is, one is CapEx is in line with depreciation. We'll continue to invest on the growth side as well as sustainability. So CapEx in line with depreciation. On the working capital, two things. As revenue goes up, obviously, we're going to consume more on the receivables side, but we continue to offset it by inventory. Our goal is to get to 75 days. We showed good progress in '24. We'll continue that in '25. Now we strive to do better than that. So as the year goes by, if we do better on inventory to offset the DSO impact or we -- there could be more than 100%, but that's the number we're going to start with and move from there. Andrew Obin : Great. And just a question on Abrasives and Industrial Specialties. It seems to be sort of nice kind of in the coal mine short-cycle business. It's been consistently declining for a while. You do sound more optimistic. But if you look at these numbers, they seem to be relatively flat for the first -- for the past four to six quarters. Any visibility there, when do they turn positive? What are you seeing in the channel? What are you seeing at inventory levels at OEMs? I know auto is probably a decent market there, but just more color as to when do you think these businesses could turn? Thank you. Bill Brown : So, good question. I mean, so both businesses in the year were down low-single digits. They're very different, Industrial Specialties is a grouping of lots of different pieces, some are growing, some are not. Overall, it's been declining, but we see that flattening out and starting to grow over time. On the Abrasives side, we should see a better '25 than '24. Part of it is because of the industrial economy. Part of it is because of the launch of a new product offering called Cubitron 3 that we launched over the last year. It's now moving into a variety of different instantiations of different Abrasive products. It's growing. It's got tremendous differentiation versus competitors. So we feel very positive about that. So we see that getting a little bit better here in '25. Part of it is because of the new products being introduced. So we think it's going to both turn the corner here in '25. Andrew Obin : But no commitment Q1, Q2, nothing more -- nothing specific like that. Bill Brown : It's a little bit granular. We'll come out. We probably can say more about this at the Investor Day when Chris talks about the individual components of his business, but nothing more today. You asked about the inventory in the channel, that's been pretty normalized. There's not any significant concerns one way or the other about inventory in the industrial channel. So that's not really the big driver here. Andrew Obin : Great. I appreciate it. See you in February. Thank you. Bill Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Morning, everybody. Anurag, one of the things that obviously stood out to me is the expectation for profit growth to be well in excess of revenue growth for this year. You obviously provided a very helpful walk around how we get there. But as we're coming up in kind of late February, we think about the multi-year outlook, do we expect a high level of incrementals to be sustainable? It doesn't have to be over 100%, but can we expect a higher level of incrementals kind of on a sustainable basis as some of these cost initiatives have legs? And I also assume cash flow is going to grow in excess of earnings growth over the next several years. And if you could just talk about that and I'm trying to square that with a 2025 buyback guide that's a little bit lower than what you kind of exited at from a run rate perspective. Anurag Maheshwari : Right. Good morning, Amit. Thanks for the question. So at Investor Day, we'll provide a framework as we look out at the medium-term as to what's kind of going to drive the sales growth and from the sales, are we going to get gross margin expansion, which is going to flow through to the bottom line. So you're absolutely correct. We will provide that framework as we get into the end of the month in February. Yes. On the cash flow side, listen, as growth -- as we continue to grow, that is going to be a drag on receivables, but we have put an inventory goal out there for 75 days. We feel there's a good path for us to get there. We're executing well towards that. And it's 100% conversion. If you look historically at 3M, it's been around there. But going forward, depending on revenue being the big variable here as well, but on inventory being something we can control, our drive would be to be over 100% conversion. Yes. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And just maybe a bigger-picture question for Bill. Love to get it. You mentioned earlier about industrial OTIF kind of stubbornly in that low 80% level. Obviously, that's a pretty big deal just given the size of that business. Can you talk about maybe when you expect to see more progress on that and talk a little bit about the manufacturing DC footprint and when you expect to make more progress on that as well? Bill Brown : So, I mean, look, I expect more progress on SIBG OTIF in January. We expect it in February. We did not expect the deterioration we saw in November and December. Part of it is certain specific issues, quality issues, a couple of specific assets, SIBG. One of the things that I've been reminded about by people is it's a much more complicated portfolio. It's about 35% more SKUs in SIBG than TEBG and it's probably more than double the number that's in CBG. So it's a pretty complicated portfolio. That being -- and there's been some unique supplier challenges in that business as well. But that being said, we expect that business to be closer to 90% this year, maybe it's towards the end of the year, but we need to be making sequential improvement throughout the year on SIBG OTIF. And I know Chris is depending upon that. His sales force is depending upon it. And more importantly, our customers are. So that's -- we're on it. We're pushing on it. It's certainly gotten a lot of attention inside the company and the team is pretty laser-focused on making those improvements. I think you talked about the complexity as well in the network. Look, it's part of a longer-term plan in terms of operational excellence. The first part really is making sure that all of our factories have a -- an improvement target, an improvement plan for how they run their four-wall spend. We will also be looking at how we can run this network that we have today more efficiently. And then over time, as we really mature the operating equipment efficiency metric, which is a measure of utilization of assets, as that gets more mature, then we can start taking on a little more of a holistic look at the overall network. But right now, it's really just focused on blocking and tackling inside the factories. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity in front of us to improve on those dimensions. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. Thank you very much. Bill Brown : Appreciate it. Thanks, Amit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks, guys. Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with China. I think you're expecting a little bit of a slowdown to mid-single digits in 2025, but definitely not too shabby. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the ground there. Bill Brown : Yes. So from a macro perspective, China is expected to slow a little bit, both from a GDP and IPI perspective. But again, it depends on what you believe in those forecasts and in those numbers. I do think that tariffs could have an effect on what's happening in China, certainly on the export part of China. So we're watching that very, very carefully. There's news of the minute on tariffs for sure. So just stepping back, Nicole, China is about 10% of our revenue globally. Last year, it was up about 10%. It was up about 13% in the first half. It sort of slowed down in the back. Part of it is from electronics. When I look at -- so half the business is export and that's been -- electronics have been an important driver. But the other half that's really sure, if you will, China for China, that did grow, was up about 3% last year. So we saw a decent growth on the ground, not quite at macro, but decent growth. We had quite a bit of activity in December, quite a bit of activity happening here in January. Again, it's -- you never know, it could be some pull aheads, could be just getting ahead of Chinese New Year, which is the end of January. We do expect that our business in China will be slower in '25 than it was in 2024, probably in the low single-digit range is what we expect for revenue for 3M in China. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bill. Bill Brown : Sure. Nicole DeBlase : And then any update on insurance recovery as I think you promised us an update each quarter. Thank you. Bill Brown : So we've -- we're making progress on insurance and we're actively engaged in arbitration, negotiations in some places, litigation with insurance carriers for both for PWS and Combat Arms. In Q4, we recovered about $170 million. So to date, so through last year, it was about $340 million, mostly in the Combat Arms area. Again, we're pretty active in pushing this to legal teams to drive this pretty hard. And as I said last time, I'll say it again, we expect our insurers to honor the commitments they have to us and in their policies and we're going to make sure that they go and do that. So that's kind of where we stand today. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks so much. See you in February. Bill Brown : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning, Joe. Joe O'Dea: Just wanted to ask one on cash and just what you think the right amount of cash to carry is. So you ended the year with cash and marketable securities at about $7.7 billion. Where do you expect to end 2025 and then thinking maybe a little bit further out, just what you think the right amount of cash to have is whether that's a percent of sales or dollar amount? Anurag Maheshwari : Hi, Joe, it's Anurag here. So we -- as you correctly said, we ended the year at $7.7 billion. It's probably 2 times of the working capital requirement for the business. If you look at '25, we said we're going to buyback shares worth $1.5 billion. At current dividend rate, we're paying about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in dividends. $3 billion, we got $3 billion to settle on Combat Arms and PWS as well. So these are the big ones we have for the year. And our plan is to refinance majority of our debt. So if you put all of that together, we should end '25 at over $6 billion in cash. Joe O'Dea: And then also, Bill, just on industrial production and what are you watching most closely there, whether it's a region, whether it's an end-market in terms of how you're thinking about where the best potential sits for this accelerating industrial production that we're kind of all waiting for? Bill Brown : Yes. So we're looking at all the different pieces. Obviously, we're pretty levered to the manufacturing economy within IPI. So that's an important one. And we're a little bit heavier weighted in U.S. and probably Europe and others after that. So clearly, U.S. is an important focus of ours in watching IPI. The current forecast is it does turn positive from minus 0.3% to plus 0.5%, I think is what it was in 2025. Europe, we have to watch. We've got a pretty good presence in Europe as well. It's a very big turnaround in Europe from down 60 basis points to up 130 basis points next year. That's a pretty big movement. So those are the key things that we're looking at, I think, pretty carefully on IPI. And it's on the industrial side. On auto, look, it's -- I'm a little bit concerned about that only because we had some deterioration last year. The auto-build forecast for this year is weakened a little bit down 60 basis points. But when you -- as I mentioned in my remarks, when you disaggregate that, U.S. and Europe are down 3 points to 4 points. China is flat and the rest of Asia is up a little bit. So we have to watch that and look at where our content per vehicle happens to be. Obviously, the team is very focused on gaining share, gaining content in those automakers that are growing faster. That's a very important strategic focus of Wendy and her team, but those are some of the things we're looking at from a macro perspective. Joe O'Dea: I appreciate the color. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hi, I wanted to circle back on the strategies for reinvigorating new product introductions, but specifically reinvigorating innovation. I know we're going to start off the analyst event at the technology center. Just -- I think there's art and science here when it comes to innovation and just be interested in your thoughts. You can't just dump cash at the front door and say, innovate, but I know you're adding some headcount. Are there any other thoughts there in terms of kind of ramping-up innovation? And how do you feel about that longstanding policy at 3M R&D where the senior scientists get 15% of unbudgeted time? Does that still fit into the equation? Thanks. Bill Brown : Yes. Look, so 15% of time is sort of a hallmark of the company. I sort of joked that it's 115%, not going from 85% to 100%, but everyone has get through 15%. And I think that's important because it gives people the time to step back and think and ponder. I mean, I do the same thing. I go into my office and I think about what are the issues upon the company. We all have to do that. So I think that's a hallmark of the culture of the organization. Look, I think the first -- look, it's not a shortage of ideas and concepts for where we can innovate. I think we've got a great list of products as you turn the scientists, the engineers on, the people doing product development, those into business units, those out meeting with the customers themselves, the ideas are there. The pipeline is pretty full. We've got to do more to keep filling it up. But the pipeline has been full. I think it's about just turning on that and unleashing that energy that's in the folks that do the innovation. And so part of it is eliminating some of the bottlenecks in the processes and I went through last time a number of pieces of that. We are shifting within our capital budget, more investment to R&D for lab equipment, for prototype equipment to speed up the prototyping and scaling up of innovation. We are adding resources there. I think if you put the right framework in place and you're motivating the teams in the way we are and we're starting to kind of focus people on the growth verticals that we really want to focus our investment and time on, I do think that that's going to pay dividends over-time. This is something that Wendy in TEBG is going to lay out pretty clearly. When we get out to the end of February, we have our Investor Day. How do we get closer to those innovation partners so that we're really tied with them very closely. So their ideas translate back to us and we're working with them in not a transactional way, but in a strategic way. And I think if you do all of these things, this machine will turn on. And again, we saw good progress over the last six months. It's early days. I think we'll have another good year in '25. But ultimately, this is going to come down to, are we growing faster than the market. Therefore, we're gaining share and are we driving margin and margin expansion because the product we're offering to the marketplace are better than what the competition puts on the marketplace. And I think that's the end objective. We have a good start. Deane Dray : That's great to hear, especially that support of that 15% unbudgeted time. That's I'm sure a lot of people like hearing that. And then just a second question, a quick follow-up on the plan for reducing inventory days. I mean, I know there's an immediate benefit for free cash flow, but is there any pressure on service levels once you start to reduce the level of inventory and is there any kind of trade-off there? Thanks. Bill Brown : Look, that's something that we're watching very, very carefully. We came down 2 days year-over-year and I think it was 8 days sequentially in Q4. In SIBG, we saw sort of OTIF come back. So we're watching this very carefully. Our intention is to prioritize OTIF over inventory, frankly. That's what we think is really important. That's a greater lever. That being said, there are opportunities to eliminate the waste, if you will, in inventory. Not all the inventory we have is good inventory. We have a lot that's stuck on the water. We have a lot of components in warehouses and factories. We have to make sure we have the right inventory. That's why I believe this is the and not the or I believe that we can get to 75 days and over 90% OTIF. And I think we can get there. That's our goal. That's what we ought to be shooting for. It's not going to be linear and we saw in Q4, it wasn't linear. We had better inventory, not as good on OTIF, at least in one segment, but that's the objective. And again, we're going to prioritize OTIF over inventory knowing that we'll get the inventory over time. Deane Dray : Very helpful. Thank you. Bill Brown : Okay. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments. Bill Brown : Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate everyone's time and attention today. I know we're running top of the hour here, but I want to thank all of the 3Mers for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to introducing you all analysts and investors to the senior leadership team of -- at 3M at our Investor Day coming up on February 26 in St. Paul. It's going to be brisk today, it's minus 18, so dress warmly. So we look forward to seeing you on the 26th. Thank you very much and have a good day. Operator : We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time.",
