McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division Operator : Welcome, and thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rob Sison : Thank you. Welcome to EA's fiscal 2014 first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Larry Probst, our Executive Chairman; Blake Jorgensen, our CFO; and Peter Moore, our COO. Frank Gibeau, our President of Labels, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of July 23, 2013, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Lawrence F. Probst: Thank you, Rob. Our performance in the first quarter reflects an important trend we have identified in the past year. Digital revenue from strong brands projected across multiple platforms has become a major component of our business. In Q1, 76% of our non-GAAP revenue was digital, driven by the online services of blockbuster franchises like Battlefield and FIFA, as well as our strong mobile portfolio. Blake will provide more detail on our financials, but EA has delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance. We did this through a combination of stronger-than-expected digital revenue and cost controls. Our results also reflect the phasing of expenses out of Q1 into future quarters. We realize this is just one quarter and there is a lot of work in front of us, but we think this is a solid step toward our ambitious goal of holding expenses flat in a console transition year. As you know, I am serving an interim role as Executive Chairman, while the Board of Directors searches for a new CEO. In this capacity, I have identified 3 priorities on which I can update you today : First, we are managing the business with continued focus on our upcoming product launches and disciplined cost controls to generate growth on both the top and bottom line. Second, I am assisting the Board of Directors in searching for a new CEO. While we have nothing specific to share today, the Board is fully engaged in this process and evaluating both internal and external candidates. Third, and most important, we are working to ensure that EA delivers the very best games and services on the new consoles, current-generation systems, PC and mobile. Again, the early returns demonstrate we are making significant progress and consumers are excited about our products. Last month at E3, our teams took home 116 awards from more than 220 nominations, more than any other publisher. Later in the call, Peter Moore will tell you about our publishing strategy, and Frank Gibeau is here to answer your questions about product development. We are incredibly excited about the momentum our teams have generated, but we aren't taking anything for granted. We have a lot of work ahead of us. EA is committed to creating and marketing the industry's best games and services and equally committed to doing it without increasing our cost. With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake Jorgensen. Blake J. Jorgensen: Thanks, Larry. Starting with our Q1 results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $495 million, which was above our guidance and Q1 last year. This quarter was marked by continued strong sales of Battlefield 3 and FIFA 2013, as well as solid performance from the rest of our catalog titles. EA's Q1 non-GAAP digital net revenue also contributed significantly to the higher-than-expected results. Digital net revenue increased by 17% year-over-year to $378 million, and accounted for 76% of this quarter's revenue. Our digital business continues to be a diversified mix of high growth, profitable segments. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 28% to a record $1.72 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performances of each business : First, extra content and free-to-play contributed $177 million, up 35% over the prior year, led by sustained growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, as well as Star Wars : The Old Republic and FIFA Online 3. This revenue relates to businesses -- or business on PC or consoles where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content. Second, our mobile business generated $103 million for the quarter, up 30% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority portion of the revenue, accounting for $90 million of the $103 million total, growing 73% year-over-year. The Simpsons : Tapped Out and Real Racing 3 continue to be key contributors. Given the significant global growth in the smartphone and tablet markets, we are very focused on this business. Third, full game downloads represent $37 million, up 12% over the prior year. This revenue is driven by PC-centric products. Solid performance by Battlefield 3 and The Sims 3, both popular PC titles, contributed to the increase in full game downloads. And fourth, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $61 million, down 25% over the same period last year. In the previous year, the Star Wars : Old Republic was a subscription-only based MMO. This year, some of the revenue was recognized in the free-to-play category as we expanded this title to be both a subscription and free-to-play game. If you were to combine all of our extra content, free-to-play with subscriptions, ads and others, we saw more than 10% growth over the same period last year. Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 63.8%, better than our guidance and an increase from 61.5% in Q1 last year. The increase was due to our focused efforts to reduce online support costs and solid results from our digital revenue offerings. Operating expenses for the quarter were $477 million, $53 million lower than our guidance. Some of the lower operating expenses are due to our cost control program taking hold, but a majority of the positive variance is due to phasing of key expenses in both marketing and headcount. As a reminder, on the last call, we prioritized a fiscal operating plan with a disciplined approach to cost control. Consequently, we anticipated incurring severance payments with the majority of the costs to be recognized in the first quarter. We executed on most of our planned actions and this quarter, we believe we are well positioned to hold our operating costs essentially flat to last year. The resulting non-GAAP loss was $0.40 per share, exceeding our guidance due to strong revenues, higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, primarily attributed to delayed spending. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $1.41 billion or $4.60 per share. Roughly 50% of this cash in short-term investment balance is held out by the U.S. Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $320 million, which is relatively flat compared to Q4 of fiscal 2013. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. However, we are still committed to our program, which, as a reminder, is a $500 million share repurchase program initiated a year ago. At this point, the total shares repurchased under this program remains at 22 million at a total cost of $278 million. Before providing guidance, we want to remind you of one specific GAAP-related item we discussed last quarter. We have developed a deeper relationship with our gamers, resulting from our growing games-as-a-service model. Our consumers are playing our games online over longer period of time, and this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue. This fiscal year, we are lengthening the recognition period, resulting in an estimated $500 million of net revenue being deferred into fiscal '15. This longer-service period has no impact on our non-GAAP revenue or cash flows. Turning to guidance and focusing on Q2. GAAP revenue is expected to be $625 million as compared to $711 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $1.22, as compared to $1.21 per share in the prior year. Our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $975 million, a 10% decrease over last year's $1.08 billion. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, we tempered our expectations on current generation titles as we are in the late stages of the console cycle, and all this quarter's packaged goods revenue will be driven by current generation offerings. This quarter, we expect to launch 5 major titles, including one free-to-play game. We also expect to release 5 mobile titles. Peter will provide more insights regarding these launches. Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 61%, slightly better than prior year, due to the positive impact we have seen from our digital product mix. Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some of our operating expenses from Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be $550 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.12 per share as compared to $0.15 per share last year. For fiscal year 2014, we are reiterating our non-GAAP guidance announced at the beginning of the year. Net revenue of $4 billion and $1.20 of fully diluted EPS. The GAAP guidance is estimated to be $3.5 billion in revenue, and a loss per share of $0.98. We recognize that our Q1 results were ahead of our guidance, but let me point out : Q1's revenue represents only 12% of our forecasted non-GAAP annual revenue, and was primarily driven by catalog titles. As I've said earlier, some of our favorable operating expense results were due to phasing, and we expect that spending to occur in future quarters. Our most significant quarters, which still presents sizable risks and opportunities, are ahead of us. Using a sports analogy, we just got through the preseason. And while we may have won all of our games, the regular season is just getting started with Q2. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter. Peter Robert Moore : Thanks, Blake. Today, I'm going to provide some perspective on 3 topics : First, an update on our performance on consoles to mobile in the first half of the year; second, a report on our progress in Asia; and third, an outline of our strategy for marketing games for both Gen4 and current generation systems, when the new hardware launches this holiday. I'll start with our performance to date. As both Larry and Blake mentioned, our first quarter was defined by the powerful ongoing performance of 2 flagship franchises, Battlefield and FIFA. FIFA 13 has been in the market for 10 months now, and Battlefield 3 for 20 months. Yet during this calendar year, both continue to chart among the Western World top 20 performing games, with FIFA still in the top 5. These blockbusters keep delivering with a service model that provides more content for the consumer and a revenue stream that extends months, even years after launch. On mobile, EA continues to chart breakout hits based on big brands. I'll start with The Simpsons : Tapped Out, which debuted on iOS in 2012. In June, we released the Waterfront update, which drove Daily Active Users to 5.9 million in the quarter and established the game as the #5 top-grossing app on both iPhone and iPad in the U.S. The Krustyland update is scheduled to release at the end of this month, and we're developing more updates to keep Simpsons fans engaged. Next is The Sims FreePlay for iOS and Android. This is a great example of how a big brand can be extended across multiple platforms. In Q1, The Sims was among the top 10 grossing games on iPad in both the U.S. and the U.K. Real Racing 3 has earned a huge fan base for bringing console-quality graphics to iOS and Android. This month, Real Racing 3 released an update, which adds new courses and features such as time trials and cars from Mercedes-Benz and Bentley. This is a big year for EA's PopCap studio, and we're seeing a lot of consumer excitement over Plants vs. Zombies 2, which will debut on iOS at the end of this quarter. The game is now in soft launch on iOS in New Zealand and Australia and has reached the #1 ranking for free-to-play games in both markets. All over the world, there is anticipation building for this one. I think PopCap is about to deliver another big winner. One final note on mobile. As both Larry and Blake mentioned, our quarter was notable for the high percentage of revenue attributable to digital games and services. To that end, Apple was EA's biggest retail partner measured by sales, and that, is a first. Next, I want to highlight some of the progress we're making in Asia. In December, we partnered with Nexon to launch the beta version of FIFA Online 3 in Korea. Since then, the game has become the #1 online sports game based on traffic and revenue in Korea and the #2 game in Korean PC caf\u00e9s. Later today in Shanghai, EA, and Chinese publisher, TenCent, will announce a similar agreement to bring FIFA Online 3 to that country as well. It's hard to frame this one without superlatives : The world's biggest online publisher is bringing the world's biggest sports game to the world's biggest market. Together, these 2 partnerships represent a growth opportunity for EA in Asia. Teaming up with publishers of the caliber of Nexon and TenCent provides local expertise and deep insight into the largest market for games-as-a-service. In the months ahead, we expect to forge additional agreements to bring EA's biggest brands to new consumers in Asia and other new markets. Next, I want to share some insight into our strategy for supporting the launch of the next-generation consoles while servicing the millions of consumers paying on current generation systems. This is particularly important this year when the new hardware launches shortly after the release of our biggest sports games. Consumers are acutely aware that new hardware is coming. Neither company has shared their specific volume targets, but there are outward signs of strong customer demand. Microsoft reports that Xbox One presales are trending ahead of the 360 during the same time period, and major U.S. retailers have sold out of their pre-sell allotments. And PlayStation believes this will be their biggest hardware launch ever. So we believe that the key indicators are pointing to a strong launch for both consoles in the holiday window. The new systems are spectacular and we expect millions of players will quickly make the transition to better graphics, online features and motion control. Our job as a publisher is to provide an easy migration for the millions of players who choose to transition onto the new hardware. EA SPORTS offers a snapshot of how we plan to do this. Madden NFL will launch on the current generation consoles on August 27th, and FIFA will follow worldwide by September 27th. Next generation versions will debut on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in the holiday quarter. Today, we announced that FIFA 14 will allow players to transfer their full roster of Ultimate Team players and in-game items from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and from PS3 to PS4. Our Madden franchise will provide a similar service, and EA SPORTS will have more news on easing the transition when we present at gamescom in August. Our goal is to make moving date painless to welcome players onto the new consoles with the minimum distraction and inconvenience. Finally, an update on product quality. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the games our teams are producing or the early reception those games are getting from critics and consumers. As many of you who attended can attest, EA had a spectacular showing at E3. We received 220 nominations and brought home a record 116 awards, including Best of Show and a slew of top honors for Titanfall from Respawn. Need for Speed Rivals won Best Racing Game. On NHL franchise, a perennial favorite with critics, won Best Sports Game. Two other games drew spectacular praise : Battlefield 4 coming this year from our DICE Studio and from PopCap, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. Now as everyone knows, this is a hit-driven industry, and this year, EA has a engineered an incredible lineup of proven blockbusters and new IP. The quality, quantity and sheer magnitude of titles coming from our studios in the next 12 months will define our leadership on the next generation of hardware. We're making incredible games, and we're planning to give them all the marketing and sales support they deserve. With that, I'll hand it back to Larry. Lawrence F. Probst: Thank you, Peter. I want to reiterate what Peter said about the line-up of proven franchises and new intellectual property that we showed at E3. We couldn't be more proud of those games, and of the people who are building them. In summary, EA is in very good shape. We are executing on a clear set of goals for leadership on mobile, PC, current-generation systems and next-generation consoles. The big bets we've made with blockbusters like FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, NHL, Battlefield 4, Sims 4, Need for Speed Rivals and Plants vs. Zombies are resonating with critics and consumers. We believe both Sony and Microsoft are offering a compelling value proposition for consumers, a big step-up in technology and an attractive price. Our mobile titles are extremely popular around the world and show great staying power with frequent content updates. All of this is happening in parallel with a renewed commitment of cost discipline and margin improvement. Our plan is to hold year-over-year operating expenses flat, a formidable goal in a hardware transition year and a first in the history of this company. I'll finish by thanking our employees and our investors for their ongoing commitment to Electronic Arts. And with that, Blake, Frank, Peter and I will take your questions. Rob Sison : Andy? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Williams. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: BMO Capital Markets. Just looking at the September quarter and your expectations for current-gen software sales. What are you -- what are you looking for as far as year-over-year comparisons for some of those key sports titles? Blake J. Jorgensen: This is Blake. As we talked about in the last quarter's guidance, component of the call when we were giving full year guidance, we helped people understand that Gen3 sports titles would be down year-over-year, slightly, with the exception of FIFA, which we believe will continue to see growth because of the strength of that franchise around the globe and that sport around the globe. We are conscious of the fact that some of those titles will also sell on Gen4, Madden for example, FIFA, NHL, and we want to make sure that we're marketing those titles into Gen4 and making that transition as smooth as possible, as Peter mentioned. But for the year, we're assuming, because some of those titles ship before the Gen4 boxes are out, that the total franchise, both Gen3 and Gen4, will be down slightly and that's built into our guidance. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then as a follow-up to that, as you look to the fiscal year to your $4 billion top line, how much of Gen4 are you looking for out of that? Blake J. Jorgensen: It's a relatively small portion. We haven't carved it out publicly. But since the installed base of Gen4 will still be relatively small even through the Christmas cycle or holiday cycle and the bulk of our titles fall in the first 3 quarters of the year, our assumptions are that a relatively small portion of our total revenue will actually be Gen4 this year. Operator : Colin Sebastian. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Robert Baird. I guess first off, Frank or Peter, at E3, you talked about lean back games and the opportunity for new business models on top of premium pricing. If maybe you can update us on how quickly we should expect some of those alternative models on franchises like Battlefield and Need for Speed and others? And in terms of the revenue upside, it looks like most of that came from the digital side of the business. Blake, maybe if you could break that out for us versus packaged goods. And as follow-up to Ed's question, given some of the positive data points on pre-orders for next gen, which is good obviously, are you seeing consumers pulling back on current gen purchases more or less than you anticipated at the start of the year? Frank D. Gibeau: Yes, this is Frank. I'll start with the first question. The good news is we're seeing that those alternative business models are already in action with games like FIFA and Battlefield. So now if you look at Ultimate Team and how we performed in fiscal '13 for FIFA, that was a $200 million digital opportunity for us. And going forward, those alternative business models, as it relates to Battlefield Premium and FIFA Ultimate Team, will continue expanding, continue to grow as the online capabilities of the Gen4 machines really manifest themselves and become real. We'll seek to expand those opportunities across additional franchises. And we are experimenting with some additional business models that you'll see come out as we release new IPs and new titles over the first 24 months of the Gen4 platforms. Blake J. Jorgensen: So on the digital piece, Sebastian, so $495 million total net revenue for the quarter. Of that, $378 million was digital, and that's a year-over-year growth of about 17%. I think important as well is the trailing 12 months now has total digital at $1.7 billion, or 28% year-over-year trailing 12-month growth. Inside the digital business, we tried to break out for people here in the formal part of the script, the key components. The mobile side of the business, up 30%. That's pretty consistent with the guidance we provided during our call last quarter for the full year. And that really is being driven by continued growth of The Simpsons franchise, Real Racing and FIFA Online 3 in Asia. And the part of the business that is also up big is an extra content business. We'd actually guided for the full year for that to be flat, because many of the social titles that we took out of the year, last year as part of our restructuring process. But the FIFA Online or FIFA Ultimate Team business continues to perform extremely well and drove that business up 35%. In addition, as you know, we started a free-to-play Star Wars business, and part of that is showing up in the extra content. So you're seeing the subscription business down 25%. That's a reduction -- some of the people moving away from Star Wars subscriptions and playing the free-to-play, which is helping drive the extra content side of the equation. And then last but not least, full game downloads was up about 12%. A lot of that is based on both franchises that Peter mentioned earlier, Battlefield and FIFA, where people are continuing to buy full game download versions of that even well into the second year of that franchise. Peter Robert Moore : Okay, Colin, this is Peter. And your question -- your final question on pre-orders, yes. This is something that, of course, you and I have seen over the years. It transitions as the consumers are anticipating the next gen hardware. We're seeing softness, in particular, on our key sports titles on current gen pre-orders. I think consumers anticipate getting the new hardware. We certainly came out of E3 with renewed enthusiasm for new hardware, and I think that's being reflected in current gen pre-orders. The only difference being that we are actually seeing strong pre-orders for Battlefield 4 versus where we were on Battlefield 3 at this time prior to launch. So softness as anticipated and as planned in pre-orders for sports titles right now. Probably the exception on that is FIFA, which we continue to see great anticipation around the world. I think pre-orders will start to come in late as consumers start to realize that there may be not enough hardware to go around for every consumer in the world to buy a next gen piece of hardware. But this is as planned, as anticipated. I do see and expect to see some pickup as we get closer to launch. Operator : Justin Post. A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. Could we move into a little, couple extra questions on digital. What really is driving the upside to your plan so far? And do you think that does carry forward and give you optimism on future quarters? And then secondly, can you give us any update on the plan for the Battlefield digital? Will it be a subscription or will it be map pack downloads? Any help on how you're going to kind of monetize the digital on that title? Blake J. Jorgensen: Sure. So I'll start and then I'll let Frank follow up on the Battlefield part of the question. We're not going to, Justin, give any new guidance relative to our digital growth. I think if there was a surprise in the quarter, it was the continued strength of FIFA Ultimate Team, as well as continued growth in full game downloads for some of the franchises that, frankly, are at the tail end of their life. Battlefield 3, for example, this is still going strong even though we're getting close to shipping Battlefield 4. So that helped drive some of the full game download. Star Wars continues to do well, and obviously, the mobile business is growing with the growth of the mobile platforms around the globe and we're benefiting from that. I think we're pretty consistent in where we think our guidance originally was on the growth there. And if that changes a lot, we'll let you know about it in future quarters. But right now, I think the general focus should be that the guidance is about the same on digital and on packaged goods going forward. Frank D. Gibeau: This is Frank. On Battlefield 4 digital, we have nothing to announce on that particular approach today. We'll have some announcements coming in the next several weeks. So we'll give you more clarity and understanding of what we're going to do there. Operator : Arvind Bhatia. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Sterne Agee. Good quarter, guys. I wanted to ask you about the earnings beat that you mentioned, some of that coming from the phasing of operating expenses. Blake, wondering if you might be able to provide some more granularity there. Just how much of that beat was expense related? Obviously, you've beaten the top line as well. And my second question is on Facebook games, where we see a general slowdown. You've pulled back a little bit. Just help us think about expectations going forward on that business. Blake J. Jorgensen: Sure. Let me hit the over delivery in Q1, and then I'll have Frank talk a little bit about Facebook games. So we are being cautious because obviously, 12% of our revenue plan has been achieved in Q1. We've got 24% phasing in Q2 and 45% in Q3. That's a lot of revenue ahead of us. And many of our costs are variable : Marketing, outside contractors that help a lot of the last-minute game testing that goes on, as well as purely the margin associated with the games volumes. And so since we've got so much ahead, we feel like some of the cost will get phased into those quarters, and we could use that or need that, and thus we're not changing our guidance. I think the other way to look at it is we've got 130-plus percent of our EPS to now go -- to go bring in, still a lot of work ahead. And I think all of us are focused on trying, as Larry said, maintain the flat cost year-over-year. We're confident that we can do that. But as part of our plan, we will not -- don't get ahead of ourselves by moving up guidance too quickly. Frank D. Gibeau: This is Frank. As we look at our content plans out over the next several years, some of the things that we looked at was frankly the opportunity cost of these different platforms versus each other. And for Electronic Arts, we saw a much bigger opportunity and much bigger audience on mobile and on the consoles for the types of products and brands that we have. So we've de-prioritized the social segment for our portfolio and moved those resources and teams to focus in on the opportunity in mobile, as well as to help us continue to grow and maintain the console side of the business. There's still a very active gaming business on Facebook and in the social channels, and we do participate there with several franchises and services. But our emphasis and focus over the next several years is going to be on mobile and HD consoles. Operator : Doug Creutz. Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Yes, Cowen and Company. Talking about sports a little bit. Obviously, you guys shipped NCAA Football a couple of weeks ago, and I wonder if you could share how that's trending versus last year and sell-through so far? Peter Robert Moore : Doug, it's Peter. Yes, as we said a couple of times now on the call, we anticipated a little bit of a slowdown in current gen. It's a current gen-only title. It's tracking below where we were with last year's title and nothing that we didn't anticipate, a long way to go yet, obviously, in selling this title through, but we're down versus where we were last year. Operator : Stephen Ju. Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Credit Suisse. So Peter, curious as to the terms of the licensing agreement with TenCent for FIFA Online 3. Shall we assume that the rev share here is a fairly standard split for most games being released in China? And any sense in terms of you when you start localization and closed beta testing and what's the government approval process? And Blake, will the new FIFA online distribution deals be booked on a gross or net basis on the P&L? Peter Robert Moore : So Stephen, on the FIFA Online TenCent deal, we're actually going to be in Shanghai tonight. The team is on the ground there making the announcement. I'm going to leave some of the details for them. I don't want to steal the thunder of what's going on there, and we obviously are not going to disclose the actual terms. But to reiterate what I said on the call, world's biggest publisher -- digital online publisher, world's biggest market, world's biggest sport. It's all good. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. All I'll add -- assume that we've baked into our forecast this year the business there. These types of arrangements take some time, as you know, to get up and running. We're very excited about the longer-term potential but we know it'll take some time. You should assume that we booked this as a net accounting, and also that the terms would be pretty standard with other type of terms you would see in a deal like this in China. Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And any other regions -- you mentioned other regions. What other countries make sense for you after China? Peter Robert Moore : Yes. We'll be announcing -- as I said, we'll be announcing further deals as we get further down the line but nothing to announce right now. Operator : Brian Fitzgerald. Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Jefferies. Maybe a quick follow-up to Doug's question. As you guys were assuming that the college football game is in next year's guidance, as you guys shift from NCAA to the Collegiate Licensing Company, what impact should we think about there? And then on the TenCent deal, should we expect FIFA to ramp as quickly in China as it did with Nexon in Korea? Frank D. Gibeau: Yes, this is Frank. I'll take the NCAA license question. Basically, we are committed to the college football business. EA SPORTS is going to be publishing a college football game next year across multiple platforms with our partners at the Collegiate Licensing Company. And our fan base is going to see all the teams, conferences and innovative features that we're known for and what makes that franchise so great. So we don't think we're going to miss a beat here. The NCAA name and marks will leave the game, but the great game play content and capturing that college football spirit will be there for next year. Peter Robert Moore : And Brian, on your question on the TenCent deal, actually, no. The thing that's different here is that we were rolling off a game with a different publisher, taking a user base and then migrating it very well as Nexon did on to the next version of the game in Korea. This is a little bit of a startup, if you will, with what TenCent is doing. So we see a slower ramp. We're not going to see much impact in this fiscal year. These are the types of things that build year 1, year 2, year 3 out. So in answer to your question, no. But the optimism for, again, world's biggest publisher, world's biggest game, world's biggest market is huge for us. Operator : Michael Olson. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : It's Piper. The OpEx discipline continues to be impressive. Just curious if you could update us on where you think there might still be room to make changes there? And would it potentially come from additional removal of titles from the library? Is it ongoing digital mix growth or changes in marketing strategies? And also if you could give us any indication on how you're thinking about multiyear target op margin potential, that will be great to hear. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. This is Blake. Our focus is continuing to try to drive OpEx, flat OpEx, which means really savings across the whole organization. We've talked about reorganizing marketing under Peter and really driving the marketing organization towards more active use of the online components of marketing, where we're connected with our customer base as much as possible and really leveraging that. Clearly, Frank's very focused on managing through the Gen4 transition and making sure that we're very focused on keeping our costs down while moving through that transition and trading out lower -- cost of the Gen3 titles that we'll start to transition over to Gen4. And then obviously, across all of the platform that our Chief Technology Officer, Rajat, has been driving really been to try to maintain and build a back office that allows us to deliver, digitally, all of the titles that we are planning on doing in our digital business all ourselves and bring our overall gross margins up with that. We've talked publicly about a multiyear plan. We're not giving multiyear guidance but we do see a path to operating margins that are clearly into the 20s. And we're all very focused on doing that and doing that without impacting -- more importantly or most importantly without impacting the quality of our games and the ability for us to deliver a great consumer experience. Operator : James Hardiman. James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC : Longbow Research. A couple of questions on Battlefield. Blake, you talked at E3 about Battlefield basically being the X factor in terms of getting to your guidance for the year. So I guess a couple of questions. Is Battlefield being roughly flat with 2011 still what you'd need to get to your $1.20 number or is it maybe a little bit easier than that given the first quarter beat? And then is there anything that you saw at E3 or within the quarter that makes you feel any better or any worse about the likelihood of Battlefield 4 meeting or exceeding Battlefield 3? And I guess just finally, if you care to give us any update in terms of the total sales to date of Battlefield 3, just as an idea of installed base, so to speak, as we get closer to Battlefield 4. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. I'll -- let me start and then Frank can get you -- probably a give you a little bit more color on what's going on with Battlefield or Peter as well. We're very optimistic based on what we saw coming out of E3. The excitement that was on the floor, the excitement around our press conference, the fact that we had 64 players playing virtually nonstop every hour the booth was open, was a very big positive, not to mention all of the nominations we got for awards. All of that continues to help us signal that we should be able to do what we did for Battlefield 3 in the year which its shipped, our fiscal '12. I don't want to speculate today if we're going to ship more or less than that. I think we're still sticking with the guidance that we provided. And a big Battlefield is obviously important to us but we're very focused on that as the marketing floor is very much in gear. And I don't know if Peter or Frank want to add to that. Frank D. Gibeau: I'll just add that we were -- that the DICE team was very encouraged and excited by the reception at E3. We will be publishing the game across 5 platforms this Christmas, and we're excited about how we're matching up against the competition and what the generation 4 technology on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is going to enable us to do. We have a lot of innovation happening in the multiplayer game and new online features. But in addition to that, the single player experience has got even more epic than in Battlefield 3. So we feel like it's a generation ahead of Battlefield 3. We believe that we will exceed expectations, and it's very exciting around here right now in terms of the teamwork that we're putting against Battlefield 4. Peter Robert Moore : And James, one more point from me. As I mentioned earlier, our pre-orders are stacking up well versus Battlefield 3. We came off a very strong E3. As I travel the world and speak to retailers, there is incredible optimism and anticipation for this title. And Frank and his team and, in particular, the DICE team has done brilliantly coming out of E3. I think we're well positioned versus our competition in this segment. And our 50 million target, which is what we ended up and what we currently have at Battlefield 3 feels very achievable. So we're feeling good there. Blake J. Jorgensen: To a part of your question as well, there's been an amazing length of the Battlefield franchise -- or lengthening of the Battlefield franchise, particularly with the premium offering, that we put in place. Everyone knows the deferred revenue that we have last year from Premium, it really speaks to the amount of players that are still actively involved with our franchise and continuing to buy both the original Battlefield 3, the Battlefield Premium offering and teeing up, as Peter said, with pre-orders for Battlefield 4. Operator : Ben Schachter. Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research : Macquarie. A couple of mobile questions and then just a quick follow-up on the guidance. There's so much focus on the next gen consoles that as you mentioned, Apple was your leading retail partner in mobile just becoming more important. Can you talk about the platform battle between iOS and Android? Are you seeing Google and Apple getting more competitive in the same way that you see the platform guys with Co-Op payments or development help, those kind of things and any potential change to the general 70-30 rev split? And then specifically just on Plants vs. Zombies 2 and the expectations, what does the revenue graph look like there? Is it a quick spike or is it slow growth? Is it -- does it last a long time? Any discussion around Plants vs. Zombies 2? And then finally, Frank mentioned some softness in the non-FIFA sports pre-orders. Is that the reason that the revenue beat in 1Q didn't flow through or was that already expected in guidance? Blake J. Jorgensen: Let me just hit the bin [ph] on the last one real quickly. That was expected in guidance, and we're pretty -- it was exactly as we thought. We would see some softness in Gen3, and that's built into what we saw at the tail end of the quarter as well as our guidance for Q2. Frank D. Gibeau: Yes, this is Frank, I'll start and maybe Peter can dial in with some of answers here. Let me start with just the general shape of the mobile business. Right now, it's growing like gangbusters. And a lot of that is due to its global nature. It's a platform that appeals across multiple regions and multiple territories. But they're very unified platforms to publish into so it's very efficient for us. Google, the Android system versus iOS, it is a bit of a rivalry right now and there's a lot of competition and there's a lot of attention and capital being deployed there to try and grow their respective businesses. We publish on both. Over the last year, we've been really expanding our Android offerings across of our titles, and that has proven to be a key growth driver for us. And we see a lot of growth in front of us, especially driven by the blockbuster titles that we have in front of us. Plants vs. Zombies 2, which comes out at the end of this quarter, is a freemium design and we'll be releasing across iOS. It will have a curve that is typical of a free-to-play game, but what you notice in mobile is what takes several years to unfold in a console business happens in a few months in mobile. But you could anticipate that these titles are starting to feel bigger and bigger and bigger. And the curves which used to be a lot slower or lower and slow are, I think, actually starting to spike a little bit earlier. But the great thing is they're really sustaining. The Simpsons is now in its second year and is doing great revenue numbers. The Sims Freeplay, as Peter mentioned earlier on the call, is in its 18th month and is seeing record revenue days and weekends. So these live services that are constantly updated with features and content, we can keep alive for multiple years. So the ecosystem on Android, the ecosystem on iOS is very positive for Electronic Arts, and we're just moving from success to success in mobile. Peter Robert Moore : Yes. And on the question on the publishers, we are absolutely as a platform-agnostic publisher, enjoying the same situation we have in consoles right now, which is Sony and Microsoft, we now have with Apple and Google. The growth, in particular, of the Android operating system, as Frank pointed out, now puts us in a very enviable position because of 2 things. We have world-class brands that consumers find very easily on both the App Store within Google Play, and you have brands now The Simpsons, Sims, Real Racing that are really starting to pull away from the competition there. So having both Google and Apple vie for our attentions and having our brands on their platforms is a very enviable position for EA and we continue to be able to leverage that going forward. Operator : Eric Sheridan. Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Sure, Eric Sheridan from UBS. A couple of quick ones. One, on the buyback, I just -- I know we've got a portion of the buyback remaining, but I also noticed that the guidance for the share count continues to tick up both next quarter and to the first fiscal year. So just wanted to sort of marry the view on the comments on the buyback with the guidance around share count. On the Origin, I don't think we've got an update on sort of subs or how you're thinking about Origin as a platform, we'd love to get that. And then on the last issue, maybe Blake, take another swing at the margin question. Is there any way you guys can quantify the development costs that are going in for next gen this year as a headwind in operating expenses, so we could sort of think about, organically, what you're taking out of the cost base as we move through the year? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. Let me start and then I'll let Frank talk about Origin a little bit. So on the buyback, we don't assume in our guidance any buyback just because it's difficult to do. And you can see this year, our buybacks has not been -- we have -- did not operate it in the first quarter because of just simply where we are in our buyback grid. We are assuming in the share count just a basic attrition assumptions inside of our company as well as issuance assumptions as part of that. So that's all you're seeing there. And we'll keep people informed as we turn the buyback back on. Our intention is to continue to buy back stock, and we're simply in between stages of that program right now. Just quickly on the development cost, and then Frank can probably add to this, is that we've told The Street both last year and this year, that roughly $80 million to $100 million a year was built in last year, and then an incremental $80 million to $100 million on top of that this year. So you got a couple of hundred million dollars of Gen4 costs. Now there's offsets to that, both in terms of Gen3 costs as well as some of the other costs that we went in to try to bring down to make sure we can hold our operating costs flat. And, obviously, that will bleed off over time as we get better at developing Gen4 titles. Frank D. Gibeau: This is Frank. If you think about high-definition console development from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14, it's flat year-over-year. What we've adjusted is the mix underneath. We're doing less current gen development, more next gen. So anything that starts to go up on next gen, Gen4-specific development is being offset by a reduction in either the SKU count or the investment in Gen3. So the mix is really what we're managing but keeping the total flat. So HD console spending flat year-over-year. As it relates to Origin, a quick update there is we're still seeing very strong growth. Digital titles like SimCity, Battlefield continue to push the full game download components of Origin. And we're committed to making that a world-class service for consumers that makes the games better. Total installs are now north of 50 million. Mobile installs are north of 22 million. We have over 500 third-party games available across the service. And we expect a very favorable year for Origin coming up, with Battlefield being a big launch for us at holiday and seeing continued sustained sales in The Sims business, as well as SimCity heading into the holiday. So we're committed to Origin, we like where we're at. We know we can do better and are committed to doing so and that's the update on Origin. Operator : Drew Crum. Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Stifel. I just want to get an update on the company's plans for pricing on next gen software. Also could you update us on your first-person shooter strategy once you move beyond Battlefield 4? And then finally, could you share with us your experience around monetization for Real Racing 3? I think you mentioned you have 45 million installs, which seems like a pretty successful game. Peter Robert Moore : Yes. This is Peter. On the next gen pricing strategy, we have not announced obviously any pricing that is set by the retailer. We're working on our pricing strategy right now for the holiday. We need more information obviously from our first-party partners. But no announcements to make. Those will come from retailers when they set their prices. Frank D. Gibeau: Yes, this is Frank. On the shooter category at E3, we announced Battlefield 4, Titanfall, as well as Star Wars : Battlefront, which has a third person component to it, so we think of it in the same category. But generally, when you look at those 3 franchise opportunities, that's how we're going to build our shooter business going forward. We're very excited at the reception for all 3. Titanfall was the Game of the Show, Battlefield 4 did extremely well in terms of demand and reviews and an anticipated buzz, and then Star Wars : Battlefront, we showed, I think, 22 seconds of kind of where we're going with it and the fan response is very positive. The DICE team is well in the development on that product already. So we feel very bullish about our shooter rotation over the next several years. Real Racing 3 is a terrific experience for us, very high quality game, released and reached a very wide audience. We've been committed and will continue to be committed to releasing content, as Peter mentioned earlier. And we've added Mercedes-Benz and Bentleys to the experience. Because it's a live service, we will constantly be adjusting it and responding to user feedback and looking at the KPIs inside the economy and constantly tweaking and making that a better game and service over the long term. So we fully expect that we'll be in the Real Racing 3 business for years, much like we see with The Simpsons as well as Sims Freeplay. Operator : Sean McGowan. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : From Needham. First question for Blake, on the expense phasing, can you talk a little bit about the headcount portion of that. Is that because people have not been hired who are going to be hired or because the recognition of expenses gets put off? And then second question, margin impact, as Origin grows, if that continues to grow as a percentage of the total business, what -- is there a gross margin impact of that growth or an operating margin impact of that growth? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. So on the headcount piece, it's not a recognition issue, it's the slowing of hiring. Part of that's coming through the work that we're doing on just trying to maintain a leaner organization, and part of it is coming through the timing for when those people are required in the company. And so you might see continued hiring during the year. Right now, it's been down because of some of the actions we took in Q4 and early Q1. In terms of your second question, I've forgotten it. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Margin impact of Origin growth? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, margin impact of Origin. We've talked publicly about our goals to be driving gross margin as well as operating margin. And in the gross margin component, we've got a couple of things, which is, one, how do we operate a very strong platform, including Origin, to be able to do all of the servicing of online business from billing, collections, marketing and so forth. We clearly are bringing -- we've been bringing that in-house and that comes in-house at a lower cost to us, and we think that will help us continue to drive gross margin. As you see, we've gone from 55% in the mid-2000 timeframe to now 66%, and we think there's an opportunity to be able to drive that closer into the high 60s over the next couple of years and maybe into the 70s longer term. And so that's clearly our goal and Origin is great key component of that. Frank D. Gibeau: All right. I think that's it. Blake J. Jorgensen: All right. Thank you very much, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion.",

I'm happy to be here today and pleased to join my first earnings call as CEO of Electronic Arts with positive news to report. Before I get into our results and a few other thoughts, let's take a moment to recognize the launch of Battlefield 4 in North America today, the culmination of efforts by the incredible teams at our DICE Studios. Patrick S\u00f6derlund and his team have done a spectacular job to deliver a game that not only represents the pinnacle of this console generation but one that is also a defining title for the next-gen consoles launching in November. We're also launching Battlefield 4 Premium across current-gen and next-gen consoles to extend and enhance the experience, making this the biggest Battlefield ever. Congratulations to the team. We are proud to add Battlefield 4 to the list of hit titles, including Madden NFL 25, FIFA 14 and others that were delivered to gamers this past quarter. As we get started here today, I'll cover a few things : a quick top line of our Q2 performance and key drivers; the opportunity in front of us and how we're positioning EA to deliver great games and services; and a quick look at EA's goals for the rest of FY '14 and beyond. Turning first to our quarterly results. EA delivered Q2 revenue and earnings above our guidance. Digital revenue, cost controls and delivering against our product plan all contributed to a very strong quarter. However, much of our work for this year remains ahead of us as we prepare to launch our titles for the next-gen consoles this holiday. Digital revenue remains a major driver in our overall performance as we deliver games and live services for our core brands across multiple platforms. We are tracking to meet or exceed our goal of generating more than 40% of our total non-GAAP FY '14 revenue from our digital businesses. From a product perspective, we delivered successful on-time launches in the second quarter for our major console titles from EA SPORTS, including NCAA Football 14, Madden NFL 25, NHL 14 and of course, FIFA 14. Madden NFL 25 and FIFA 14 also launched on iOS and Android this quarter, and of course, the much-anticipated Plants vs. Zombies 2 landed on iOS in August. In line with our previous guidance, our current-gen EA SPORTS holds [ph] has seen some initial softness in sell-through, a trend we expect in moving into a console transition. However, this is tempered by the unique opportunity we have with versions of Madden NFL 25, FIFA 14, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed Rivals and NBA Live 14, all launching on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in November. Cost control measures delivered better-than-expected results in Q2, coming in $51 million ahead of our guidance. Our operating margin expansion effort is a great indicator of our increased financial discipline and focus on growing EA's bottom line. We are confident that we can continue to move faster and further than we already have on a go forward basis. With these factors driving our current outlook, we are raising full year guidance today. Looking ahead, EA is in a strong position as we move into a momentous season for our company and the gaming industry at large. Our studio teams put the finishing touches on powerful -- on a powerful lineup of titles for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. We continue to be encouraged by the market reception and growing consumer excitement. The latest indicators from Microsoft and Sony, along with pre-order data, shows strong demand for the new consoles. Both Sony and Microsoft have also committed that they will continue to fully support the existing PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. Meanwhile, our industry is far more dynamic and diverse moving into this console transition than ever before. The global player base for mobile games is expanding, and we're also seeing strong performance in PC-based free-to-play games around the world. Our strategy is directly aligned to each of these key growth opportunities : next-gen consoles, mobile and free-to-play PC. EA's blueprint for success is visible with fan favorite brands such as FIFA, where we offer experiences tailored for each of these environments. FIFA 14 for consoles, including Xbox One and PlayStation 4, FIFA 14 for iOS and Android mobile devices, as well as free-to-play online experiences for PC such as FIFA Online 3 in Korea. Tens of millions of fans are engaging with our games every day. These titles are live services, with connected features and new content, keeping the experience fresh for players long after launch. Recent changes that we've made to EA's structure will help us more aggressively capture these opportunities. Key studio leaders, Patrick S\u00f6derlund and Lucy Bradshaw have been elevated to lead our development efforts across next-gen consoles and PC. Frank Gibeau is leading a consolidation and double down of our mobile efforts. COO Peter Moore continues to lead and transform our operational and polishing teams and bring our games to market. And Rajat Taneja, our CTO, continues to lead development of our world-class technology platforms. While not dramatic changes, these refinements will help us better leverage our IP and integrate successful development practices across our entire portfolio. In a moment, I'll hand over to Blake to walk through the specifics of our financial results. With this is my first quarterly call as CEO, I wanted to take a moment to speak about 3 elemental beliefs that I have for EA moving forward. First, delivering amazing games and services for gamers must be at the core of everything we do. The central strand of our DNA that defines who we are and the experiences we work to create. Our reputation as a company is built on our ability to develop strong relationships with players through the games we make, and we are committed to strengthening that bond. Second, EA's biggest strengths are our people and our strategy. Our deeply talented developers and business leaders are the lifeblood of EA, enabling us to bring powerful IP like Madden, FIFA, Battlefield, The Sims, Star Wars and more to gamers around the globe. Combined with our strategy to take these titles across different platforms, geographies and ways to play, EA has a foundation for decades of healthy growth. Third, making games profitably is vital to EA's future. Simply put, we owe great games to our players and strong returns to our shareholders. Each of these beliefs is borne out of my experience as a passionate, longtime employee of this company, having had the benefit of working in multiple parts of our business across a number of continents. These are the defining characteristics of a new era at EA, one that I am incredibly excited to lead for our gamers, for our teams and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake Jorgensen. Blake J. Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. Turning to our Q2 results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.04 billion, which was above our guidance and 4% lower than last year. This quarter's revenue was driven by our sports titles and continued strength in our catalog offerings like FIFA 13, SimCity, Star Wars : The Old Republic and Battlefield 3. In line with our guidance, all of our sports titles except for FIFA 14, sold in less than the prior year. Lastly, positive foreign currency gains of $9 million also added to the revenue upside. Q2 non-GAAP digital net revenue also contributed to the quarterly -- solid quarterly performance. Digital net revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $348 million. Our digital business continues to be a diversified mix of high-growth profitable segments. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 22% over the prior year to a record $1.75 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and free-to-play contributed $127 million, up 11% over the prior year, led by continued growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, FIFA Online 3 and Star Wars : The Old Republic. This revenue relates to businesses on PCs or consoles where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content. One exciting trend to note, our year-to-date results for each of our sports Ultimate Team businesses, Hockey Ultimate Team, NCAA, Football Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, and of course, FIFA Ultimate Team, demonstrated revenue growth year-over-year. However, our decision to sunset several of our social titles offset some of this growth, as we saw revenue declines from The Sims Social and SimCity Social. Second, our Mobile business generated $105 million for the quarter, up 19% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority of the revenue, accounting for $87 million of the $105 million total, and growing 34% year-over-year. The Simpsons : Tapped Out, The Sims FreePlay and Real Racing 3 continue to be key revenue generators, and the launch of Plants vs. Zombies 2 also contributed to our mobile revenue. Mobile growth was dampened by a $15 million decline in our Japanese FIFA World Class Soccer business. This product was developed and hosted on social mobile platforms, and Japanese gamers have migrated to apps built natively for the iOS and Android platforms. Going forward, we are developing and will roll out games built for the iOS and Android platforms in Japan and other key regions. Third, full game downloads represented $54 million, up 42% over the prior year. This revenue was driven by PC-centric products, strong demand for SimCity, as well as the deferral of Q1 SimCity revenue into Q2 were the drivers for the significant increase. And fourth, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $62 million, down 16% over the same period last year. In the previous year, the Star Wars : Old Republic was a subscription-only based MMO. This year, some of the revenue was recognized in the free-to-play category, as we expanded this title to be both a subscription and a free-to-play business. Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 61.7%, up over last year's 60.1% and slightly better than our guidance. The improvement was due to our growth in digital, lower processing fees as we move away from the social business and the benefits of our new digital platform. Operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $82 million from last year and $51 million lower than our guidance. Lower operating expenses this quarter illustrates that our cost control programs are taking hold. However, we believe all of this benefit should not be factored into the full year results. There continues to be risks associated with the transition to next-generation consoles. These risks could impact sales and marketing and R&D expenses. In addition, some of our positive variances are due to phasing of marketing expenses into the holiday quarter. As we continue to manage expenses and headcount, we are progressing towards our goal of flat to down operating expenses, something we have not previously accomplished in a console transition year. Achieving this goal will help our efforts to deliver operating margins above 20%. The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.33 per share. EPS exceeded our guidance of $0.12 per share due to lower operating expenses, stronger revenues and slightly higher gross profit margins. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $1.42 billion or approximately $4.60 per share. Roughly 60% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held outside of the U.S. Also, as seen on our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, this quarter, we recognized a $40 million GAAP-only charge for the expected litigation settlement and license expenses related to our college football business. Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $6 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $342 million. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. We remain committed to our program, and as a reminder, it is the $500 million share repurchase program initiated a year ago. At this point, total shares repurchased under this program remain at 22 million, at a total cost of $278 million. Now turning to guidance. Last week, we announced that Titanfall will launch in this current fiscal year, while The Sims 4 will be released next year. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our previous non-GAAP guidance, as the launch date and the Q4 forecast for Titanfall is broadly similar to that of The Sims 4. Non-GAAP revenue and gross margin guidance remain at $4 billion and 66%, respectively. However, due to the favorable results of our cost control efforts, we are now estimating operating expenses to be reduced to approximately $2.1 billion, and we are raising our EPS guidance to $1.25 per share. The GAAP guidance is expected to be $3.55 billion in revenue and a loss per share of $0.72. As we have pointed out in past quarters, our consumers are playing our games online over longer periods of time. And this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue. This fiscal year, we are lengthening this recognition period, resulting in an estimated $450 million of net revenue being deferred into fiscal 2015. This longer service period has no impact on non-GAAP revenue or on cash flows. With respect to Q3 guidance, GAAP revenue is expected to be $775 million as compared to $922 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $1.42 as compared to $0.15 per share in the prior year. Again, this is primarily due to the longer revenue recognition period. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $1.65 billion, a 40% increase over last year's $1.18 billion. Our fiscal third quarter is expected to account for more than 40% of our full year revenue. This quarter, we are launching major titles for current and next-gen consoles. Our Q3 non-GAAP revenue guidance is being impacted by certain upgrade programs we have rolled out in connection with the console transition. We are required to defer revenue associated with our current-gen marketing programs that allow consumers to buy a next-gen game at a discount. As a result, we believe there will be some deferral of revenue into Q4 as some gamers delay taking advantage of this upgrade program. Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 68%, better than prior year due to our digital growth and revenue mix. Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some expenses from our previous quarters. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $600 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.22 per share as compared to $0.57 last year. Regarding cash flow, we're maintaining our estimates for fiscal '14 operating cash flow and capital expenditures of at least $400 million and $100 million, respectively. This implies expected free cash flow generation of over $300 million or approximately 1.4x what we generated in fiscal '13. While the higher EPS guidance should generate more cash flow, the $40 million GAAP-only charge related to our college football business that I mentioned earlier, will likely offset this benefit, causing us to maintain our previous projections. In summary, we recognize the first half results were ahead of our guidance, but as I noted earlier, the upside is driven mainly by our cost control programs taking hold, and phasing some of our operating expenses into the second half of the year. Q3 represents more than 40% of our total non-GAAP revenue and 98% of our annual EPS. Similar to the World Series, where the remaining game or two will determine the season for Peter Moore's beloved Boston Red Sox, the next few months will determine the success of our fiscal year. Our team is battle tested and ready, and today we are sending our ace, Battlefield 4, to the mound. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. Q2 was an exceptional quarter for EA. With digital growth, improved cost management and a slate of successful titles giving us strong momentum moving into the second half of the year. Our attention is now looking forward to our next-gen launches, ramping up our mobile effort and positioning our long-term IP development to deliver amazing new experiences to our gamers wherever they want to play. When the next-gen consoles begin to ship next month, EA will deliver an unprecedented lineup in the launch window. Battlefield 4, Madden NFL 25, and FIFA 14 will be available Day 1 for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. NBA Live 14 and Need for Speed Rivals then join our next-gen roster just a few days later. In March, we'll launch Titanfall, a thrilling new first-person action experience from our partners at Respawn Entertainment. In mobile, games like Plants vs. Zombies 2, FIFA 14, The Simpsons : Tapped Out and Real Racing 3 are showing how major brands can break through the cluttered ranks to continually engage players on smartphones and tablets. We will lean heavily into our key brands as we double down on mobile development to accelerate our growth in this vital segment. In the last 2 weeks, you've also seen several announcements about our product slate for the remainder of this year and into FY '15. We are refining our focus on our biggest brands and great new IP in development, including The Sims 4, EA SPORTS UFC, FIFA World Cup and Dragon Age : Inquisition. Looking further out, we have a strong pipeline of new IP taking shape, including Star Wars : Battlefront. At our core, we're resolved to continue strengthening EA's relationship with the hundreds of millions of gamers that play our games around the world. Every day, we hear from our gamers about what they'd like to see next from EA. This feedback is incredibly valuable and shapes our decisions about the games we make. Providing great experiences for our gamers, supporting our talent and executing on our strategy, as well as delivering profitable growth. These are the fundamental beliefs that define EA today. Combined, they drive us to deliver every day on commitments to our most important stakeholders; a commitment to support our talented teams as they create the absolute best games and services; a commitment to do the work needed to be known, loved and respected by gamers for the games that we create and a commitment to deliver profitable growth and continually improved returns to shareholders. I look forward to sharing our successes with all of you in the years to come. With that, Blake, Peter, Patrick and I will take your questions. Operator : Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird & Company. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : First off, just the launch of Battlefield. Wondered if you can comment on some of the initial feedback, and if the game has ended up in line with your own quality expectations. And then secondly, Andrew, I'm wondering if you can expand a bit on how you see the next-gen cycle impacting EA and the direction that you're taking the company. And moving to the studio level, maybe Patrick, along those same lines, how do you guys see this playing out in terms of the expense structure and the development structure? Patrick S\u00f6derlund : I'll start, Patrick, I'll start the, on the Battlefield question first. It's very early. We launched the game yesterday in North America. It's coming out in a couple of days in Europe. Early signs are positive, the reviews are strong. I think we have to reflect upon what the DICE team in Sweden have built. It's a game that's we're launching on 5 platforms. It has features that have never been seen before in a game, like you can connect via tablet and play the game in a meaningful way. There are other features, like 64 players in 60 frames that console players will see for the first time. And overall, the reviews, as I said, have been positive. We're seeing a 9.5 from Gametrailers, we're seeing a 9.5 from Machinima, we've seen a 9.0 from Joystiq and on. Peter can probably comment more on market dynamics, but from a product perspective, we're very pleased with it. Peter Robert Moore : Yes, Colin, it's Peter. As to your question of where we feel, from a publishing perspective, the market has embraced it. We've certainly hit our planned sell-in numbers. If you hit Retailer, and I know you do, you'll see end caps and aisle stuff, you've seen our marketing on television and online. To Patrick's point, it's still early. We've just shipped in the last few hours, obviously in the United States and Canada. We're yet to ship in Europe, and we'll have a better feel for initial sell-through by the end of the week. But so far, so good. We feel all of the core elements are in place. As you've seen with other AAA launches in the last few weeks, current-gen seems to be holding up. We are very, very excited and you've seen a lot of footage that Patrick and his team at DICE had put out on next-gen. We're also excited about what we're seeing on pre-orders for that. So from our perspective, when we look at what the key dynamics are right now, feeling very good. I can tell you that on Origin, the PC version, the preorders are up 35% versus Battlefield 3, and that's a good precursor for the PC version of that game. And we're seeing strong engagement online already for the PC version of Battlefield 4. But early days yet, Colin. Andrew Wilson : And certainly to answer the question around next-gen and the strategy for the company, I'd start by saying this is my third major transition at this company. And so I've had the great benefit to see the good, the bad and the ugly as we've come through transitions. And certainly coming out of the last transition, we were resolute in our desire to ensure that we didn't have that kind of challenge again. So as we approach this transition, I would say we started work earlier than we ever had done before, and we worked more closely with both Microsoft and Sony throughout the entire process. And the end result is, we have a launch slate of games that are the best transition games that I've ever seen come out of this company. And so as I take that and look forward, I think we are starting this console generation far stronger than we ever have done before. And the platform and the foundation that we have built, I believe, is going to serve to ensure that we can deliver great games to gamers for many, many years to come. Operator : Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: A quick question, looking at next-gen consoles. What's your thought as to the relative significance that we'll see out of next-gen consoles for revenues, for properties such as FIFA, Madden, Battlefield this year? So how do we kind of gauge what to expect on those or next-gen, call it, 5 months of the year? Blake J. Jorgensen: Let me start at it, and then I'll have Peter talk a little bit about the market. I think as you know, we've guided that next-gen for fiscal '14 is a relatively small part of our overall business. Clearly, we'll be putting out 5 next-gen titles this quarter. We'll have a better feeling for how quick the uptake is and what the attach rate is to those. And we believe things like Battlefield will do extremely well in next-gen. But we also understand that the market's going to take time to build. And so our forecast for full year assumes relatively low next-gen, uptick of our core business. Pater, you might want to talk about what you see so far... Peter Robert Moore : Yes. So Edward, you and I had been through many of these transitions together, and you're familiar with the way that this thing climbs and builds into your installed base and then the attach rates. When I talked to our friends at both Sony and Microsoft, and I'm trying to get some indications in the numbers that are going to be available for sale by the end of our fiscal year on March 31 and I aggregate them, I think I can squint and see 10 million units combined, very easily. Both Sony and Microsoft are proposing that this could be their best launches ever as regards their production numbers and their ability to globalize this business quickly. So we feel bullish about our ability, to Blake's point, of having 5 truly next-gen titles available for that. As regards to attach rates, we typically, as you know, see maybe 3 titles per unit. And depending on how aggressive bundling goes on with the first parties, but I don't see any indication that there would be any less than that right now, from what we're seeing and hearing from our retail partners. So I think overall, we feel very bullish. We've got the right product at the right time. We have not had some of the problems some of our fellow publishers in the industry have been getting. Our quality title's ready for next-gen. We feel, as we've said on previous earning calls, we're well ahead of this transition and we're going to nail it. So all in all, again, early days with either of them, both to launch yet, but feeling good about product quality from their end, production quality from their end, franchise quality from our end and our ability to attach strongly to the boxes by the end of the fiscal year. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, great. And then, Blake, if you can comment a little bit the phasing issue, with regards to marketing. How much have you kind of scaled back your marketing that you traditionally would've spent at this point in recognition that these new consoles are launching in November? Blake J. Jorgensen: Well, our guidance originally had already made some adjustments for the new boxes being launched at Christmas time. And we're trying to be prudent in all our expenses, as you know, and there's a small amount of phasing that's going on. It's not a huge number, but we wanted to just be careful that you guys don't roll all of our savings for the first half of the year into the back half of the year. We're also, as we've talked about, trying to save some dry powder for further marketing if it's required during the holiday season, because we fully appreciate it's going to be a competitive timeframe for titles amongst all the publishers. Operator : Justin Post of Bank of America. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is Ryan Gee actually in for Justin. Blake, this is probably a question for you. Talking about the softness you are seeing on the current-gen titles, I'm wondering for 3Q, how much of the guidance assumes that you make up some of that shortcoming on next-gen with sports titles, be it Madden or FIFA, how much do the next-gen console launches help you in 3Q? Or is it really just predicated on the frontline titles hitting? I'm just trying to get a sense what the risk for how that quarter, if maybe Madden or FIFA don't see much of a bump? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, no, I mean, we've -- as we started the year, we forecasted that all the sports titles, with the exception of FIFA, would be down. And that has -- year-to-date, that has proven to be exactly as we had forecasted in line with our guidance. We are assuming that will continue in the back half of the year, and thus the mix that we originally forecasted on Gen4 versus Gen3 will continue as we guided and as we're continuing to observe in our guidance at $4 billion for the full year. I would say if there's greater interest in next-gen boxes or the software attach rate, it's higher than that's upside for us, because we have not built that in as a critical component of our business plan for the year since most of our titles shipped before the next-gen boxes. So long-winded way of saying, it's basically in line with our original guidance, and we're still seeing that play out in the marketplace, and we're confident going forward that, that will be consistent in the back half. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. And then looking ahead, just to the next-gen, it might be a little early but you guys have already talked about Star Wars and we know Titanfall is coming. I was wondering if you can give us a sense for, really, your next-gen endeavors beyond those 2, either talk about your -- percent of resources that are being allocated towards next-gen, or maybe even just the number of titles you guys have in the works. One of your competitors today talked about the number of next-gen titles they have coming. So if you could do anything around that, that would be great. Andrew Wilson : So I don't know that we've got a lot to share at this point, other than you can expect us to continue to invest behind the big brands that we've talked about today. The second piece I would say is, that we are continuing to invest heavily, both in our Frostbite engine and our Ignite engine and our underlying digital platform. And while we certainly have incubation going on through the company, we believe that those engines, in and of themselves, will ensure that any products that we bring out in the future will certainly be genre-defining and hopefully industry-defining titles. Blake J. Jorgensen: And we have, I think as you know, we've talked about, without specifics on timing, we've talked obviously about titles like UFC, which is being developed and introduced next year. Obviously, a FIFA World Cup. We've talked about Dragon Age, and obviously, the Star Wars titles, ultimately in the future years. And so there's a lot going on. And much of our cost base is turning from Gen3 development to Gen4 development. Historically, that's been a problem for us, this time I think we've managed it extremely well, and that's why we're able to hold our cost down. And we'll continue to reduce our cost in Gen3 development as our Gen4 takes over the full development. But we will have Gen3 and Gen4 titles in the mix for a long time to come. Just as no different than we'd still ship the occasional Gen2 title that we're still making. So it's part of how we operate the business. And I think we've had a very good handle on the cost in that shift, and should help us continue to bring our cost down in the future. Operator : Doug Creutz from Cowen & Company. Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I wonder if one of you could talk, maybe about FIFA a bit. I think in your prepared comments, you certainly implied that your selling for FIFA in the September quarter was not down year-over-year. We've certainly seen some evidence that the sell-through has been weak. Could you maybe talk about how that's trending, is embedded in your December quarter guidance, maybe a little bit less than re-orders of FIFA than you might normally expect to see in a year? Peter Robert Moore : Hey Doug, it's Peter. Yes, I mean, we've hit our selling numbers. As you know, our sell-through right now was a little softer than we projected, but nothing that we didn't expect ultimately, given the commentary you've heard from Blake here. I think the important thing to look at here is data that you can see is engagement levels that we're enjoying on FIFA right now, and they're certainly up year-on-year versus FIFA 13. Why is that important? Because of the amount of digital revenue we can continue to drive. You know very well the importance of FIFA Ultimate Team and the other Ultimate Teams that Blake alluded to in his prepared comments and how important that is to the growth going forward. Engagement is what we're looking at right now. FIFA has got a very long tail, and next-gen will give it a boost on top of that. But we're ready for an exciting next-gen FIFA. You've seen the trailer this week that we launched. We think that helps us enormously. And current-gen, certainly, on a global basis, on a global title like this, still, it will be very important for a number of years to come. So yes, selling was a plan. I think replenishment will continue. Engagement is above plan, which is very important to us and we'll continue to push hard as we always do. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, and I think remember, as well that we're doing some bundling with Microsoft in Europe around Xbox One. And while we think we've done a good job of predicting, it's hard to determine, in fact, how much that may have impacted sell-through in any key markets. And that product, obviously is built into the Q3 and Q4 forecast. But remember also that part of the reason that Q3 revenues shifted into Q4 is some of the upgrade programs where we've -- we're providing a upgrade for users from a Gen3 title to a Gen4. We won't recognize that revenue until Q4 and thus some of the phasing difference. Operator : Drew Crum from Stifel, Nicolaus. Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : So Blake, I wonder if you could dig in a little deeper on the gross margin guidance for the third quarter, 68% looks relatively high to prior quarters. And we'd think it could be a little lower, given the console launch for Battlefield. And then, a question on Titanfall. We've got some history with The Sims. You're suggesting that the slate shift will be neutral to earnings. Can you talk about your assumptions or expectations for Titanfall? And can you let us know if this is a times exclusive or not? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. So first on the gross margin. Gross margin guidance of 68%, relative to 66% in Q3 FY '13, excuse me, is it's higher for a couple of reasons. One, higher shift of packaged goods to digital, a mix shift -- overall revenue mix shift, and obviously, Battlefield is a very high-margin title relative to what we saw in Q3 of last year. So we're very confident in that gross margin forecast, and much of it has to do with both Battlefield and the digital piece. On Titanfall versus The Sims, a couple of things to note. First, with our partners at Respawn, who have done an amazing job developing what looks like a fabulous game. They've done a fantastic job keeping that on schedule and possibly even ahead of schedule in some ways. We saw an opportunity and a launch window in the fourth quarter because of some of the critical titles that were planned to be there moving out of the quarter, like Watchdogs or The Crew or some other titles, it looked like they're being delayed. Titanfall is a title that also has an amazing following already in the market. Ever since it was shown at E3, people have been highly interested in it. Microsoft wanted to include it in its marketing campaign associated with Xbox, which you're seeing in the market today. And all of that led us to decide to move it into the year. The Sims is a title that can be shipped almost any time in the year. The Sims 3 was shipped in June 2009. It can ship in the summer, in the winter, in the fall. It's a title that has a huge following. And we can always continue to develop, because much of that title is based on not just the base title, but also expansion packs. And so we'll use the additional time to continue to develop greater expansion packs and the product. In terms of the forecast, both products were expected to ship in the last part of the quarter, essentially the middle of March. So it's only 2 weeks of sales. In the case of Titanfall, it's a brand-new IP, and it's exclusive only, for the life of the title, on Xbox One and Xbox 360 and PCs. It's a first-person shooter, and 2 of the biggest shooters are our own shooter Battlefield and obviously Call of Duty, will have already shipped in the holiday. And so we're being somewhat conservative in our forecast for what the revenue is, and it's similar to what we expected for The Sims. Second, The Sims is a high-margin product because it's wholly-owned IP. Titanfall is obviously a product that we share the revenues and profits with Respawn. But as any of our developed titles through our partnership agreements, we typically invest in the title and expense those costs along the way. And so for the year, the profitability of Titanfall is similar to The Sims, because we've already expensed the bulk of that R&D. And thus the trade-off in profitability is equal, and we found that it was a good time to shift one for the other. And so that's the quick story, and we're extremely excited about both Titanfall and The Sims, and we think it's going to help make not just this year, but next year very, very strong. Operator : Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Andrew, sorry to sound like a worrywart and Blake, you addressed this a little bit, but I mean, frankly, we're not used to seeing game release dates come early. It's usually the other way. So we're wondering if Titanfall is being rushed a little bit, and what extra steps you might be taking to ensure the quality is there? As this first release should hopefully be one of many. And Blake, in your quarterly disclosure, you have some off balance sheet liabilities reaching about $1.3 billion right now, so I'm just wondering what this is, and if you can give color as to where this is coming from? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, Stephen, let me start with the off balance sheet item, and then I'll have Patrick and Andrew talk to the Titanfall. Patrick's been very close to the Titanfall development. As a simple reminder, we always said Titanfall was spring of this year, so we were always planning either March, April, May, right in there, so it's not a big movement in title. But Patrick's been working with the team at Respawn, and he can talk to that. On the off balance sheet liabilities, I know that's a question that comes up because I've heard it from quite a few investors, as well as analysts. And people tend to worry about anything they see as off balance sheet. I think critical in our business is, we want to make sure people understand what our forward commitments are for any of our developer or licensor agreements. We have those with, obviously sports leagues, with athletes, a whole variety of people. The key to remember is, those are tied to products. So the risk would be, we stop making the product. And I don't think we're going to stop making FIFA anytime soon. And thus any of those future commitments that are associated with FIFA revenue, i.e. royalty on FIFA revenue, we would continue to be able to make. So the case out there that says, the off balance sheet liabilities are a problem, have to imply that we would actually exit products and be on the hook for those liabilities. And in most cases, they are tied directly to products like FIFA, like Madden, like Star Wars, where we have all intentions of making the product and all intentions of making a really strong products that will easily cover the royalties within the goals of our profitability plans going forward. So with that, let me turn it to Patrick and Andrew on the Respawn ship dates. Patrick S\u00f6derlund : Yes, this is Patrick. So on the quality side, and if we're rushing a game, I would say no, we're not doing that at all. This is a very experienced, seasoned team, one of the best in the industry. They've got a bunch of great games under their belt. We have been monitoring and working with them for a long time. This has been a game that's been in development for multiple years. And all the data that we have in front of us suggest that this game will not only be highly rated, but very highly rated. So I feel better than I would normally feel at this time, on a game like this. Andrew Wilson : And certainly, I think your perception is right. Throughout our industry, that might be different, but having seen the game, having seen what's coming, we are very, very excited about the launch of Titanfall, and truly believe it's going to define this platform generation from the outset. Operator : Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : My question is on FIFA 14 Xbox One bundle in Europe. Blake, can you help us maybe understand the economics and the accounting a little bit better? Will the profitability of FIFA 14 with a bundle be very similar, maybe a little better, because you get some help from Microsoft? Or is it a little bit less, but you make it up on volumes? Just curious how it's all going to work. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, I can't comment on the specifics. What I would say is that it's a part of a Microsoft bundle, and so thus we're not reserving any sales reserves or price protection that we might normally reserve on a normal product in the channel. It's going in through a Microsoft box. But you should trust that we're not providing a major discount on the product. We want to maintain the profitability of the FIFA franchise, and that's critical to us. What we're really trying to do is help introduce new players to FIFA, and Microsoft is trying to build a bigger share in Europe for Xbox, and those 2 fit really well together. Peter, you want to... Peter Robert Moore : Yes, I could, I think -- and the third leg to that stool is the fact that the more people that obviously get FIFA in their hands, the more opportunity we have to be able to provide them with the digital services, FIFA Ultimate Team, particularly in the European market where we see very strong engagement levels. So to Blake's point, this is about Xbox One being driven hard with a world-class game that gamers, particularly again in the European marketplace flock to. It allows us to get obviously 100% of those consoles attached to FIFA, and as a result, our attach rate to digital consumers in the digital services, in the form of FIFA Ultimate Team benefit us. So I think it's a win-win for both companies. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : One bigger picture, longer-term question for you guys as a management team. As you forecast and look out in this next-generation, I know that previously a lot of people were thinking this coming generation is going to be perhaps slightly smaller than the last gen. As you guys now think about everything you know, the titles that are coming out, the number of units, et cetera, in terms of consoles, has your opinion shifted at all one way or the other? Are you incrementally more bullish, you thinking the next cycle's going to be similar, bigger, smaller? Just curious how you think about the next 5 years or so? Andrew Wilson : Yes, I think it's a great question. Certainly, as we look at this console generation, I think we, as a company, have always been excited about it. One, it's made us progressively more excited and more bullish, I believe, this would come through this year, is as we've seen the kind of energy and excitement at a consumer level, really start to resonate. I think it really started to heat up at E3. We saw an energy around our industry that haven't seen in a little while. It's certainly reached a roll by Gamescom, which is a consumer-driven show, and we really saw an energy there. And again, when you look at the success of a console generation through the combination of 2 things, great consoles and great software. And as I talked about earlier, I think that our launch software this time is head and shoulders above where we were last time. And certainly will, I believe, satiate appetite for gamers and actually grow the industry over time. So we are certainly bullish as we come into this platform generation, particularly as well as we have executed. Blake J. Jorgensen: I think the other thing to remember is, we're a completely different company than we were during the last console transition. A huge portion, over $1.75 billion of our revenue is coming from digital, and what that really means is, we're looking for ways to not just diversify our revenue, but also to enter new parts of the market that didn't exist before, mobile, free-to-play PC. Many of these didn't exist in the last console transition, certainly were monetized like they are today, and we're trying to make sure we're focused on all of those areas. And we're trying to take our current product strength and extend that through building the life of the product at a much more exciting gameplay that goes on for 1 year or 2 years. We were selling, in Q2 of this year, Battlefield 3. And the reason for that is, Battlefield Premium, the love for the product and the excitement around the product. We'd like all of our products to have that type of life, that is extending the gameplay over time, and we think that's going to be critical to our success. Andrew Wilson : Yes, and one more point, actually a couple more points on that, is that this is the third transition I've gone through, and both companies here have pieces of hardware that feel to me, certainly, from my experience, that the pricing can come down pretty aggressively over the next few years. Sony is starting off of a full $200 cheaper than they did in the previous generation. The services attached to these consoles now are incredibly sticky, and both companies are touting their entertainment features, which make this a must-have device, not just for hard-core gamers but for households, for families. And when you bring all of that together, I think our ability to be able, as a company, to take advantage of that is huge. But to Blake's point, we're a different company than we were 8 years ago when this previous generation started. And the diversification of our content offerings, our ability to deliver live services, allows us to be somewhat inoculated from the bumpiness of console transitions. And I think you're seeing -- you're certainly seeing that in this past quarter, and you're going to see that going forward here. But certain amount of bullishness that I think I certainly can talk about, and what retailers around the world talk to me about, versus maybe where we were 6 months ago when we were looking at this console generation transition. Operator : Ben Schachter from Macquarie research. Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research : A couple of high-level questions, and then one quick housekeeping one. I'm not asking for guidance but over the next few years, how do you think ASPs or ARPU can really differ on this next-gen versus the current-gen? And what are going to be the main key drivers for that? And then second one is just on mobile. Understanding that franchises and big franchises are key in mobile, but aside from that, what are the other big advantages that you can bring to mobile, because of the scale of EA? Andrew Wilson : I'll take a crack at that. Certainly, I think it's hard to predict the average return per user over time, and certainly as part of the console generation. But here is what I would say is that our games are, in fact, engaging gamers for longer and with greater immersion than they ever had. As we think about the gamer that has a certain entertainment spend, a portion in their wallet from week-to-week, month-to-month, the more of their engagement time that we can drive, and the greater and deeper experiences that we can drive, we should almost certainly benefit from a greater proportion of that predetermined entertainment spend. And so as we look forward when we're thinking about developing games, we now always build games plus services. We're moving from product to product plus service. You've seen it in the trailing 12 to 18 months, and you will certainly see it on a go forward basis. And that's good for us, and it's good for gamers, and we believe that is the future of this company. When you think about mobile and what we can do there, again, if I think about how gamers play, they're -- more and more gamers are playing and they're playing for more and more time, and their desire for more integrated, immersive experiences with high fidelity controls, high fidelity graphics, stronger store reactions, just greater levels of engagement opportunity overall, that starts to play to our strengths. And so when we think about mobile on a go forward basis, some of the greatest things that we have been doing through the history of this company really start to become a strength, as the personality of mobile gamers advances and evolves, and as platform hardware increases in processing, GPU, output and memory. So all things considered, if you combine the services against console that we believe are the foundation for the future of this company, and you look at where mobile is going and how that plays into the strength of us as a company, that potentially some of our newer competitors do not share, we feel very good about the future. Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research : Okay, and just quick housekeeping. I came on a little late. But Peter, I think you said, 10 million units combined for the next-gen. Was that your fiscal year? Peter Robert Moore : That's the estimate for what I see, and speaking with our partners at Sony and Microsoft. Those are available for sale on the shelf by March 31 of 2014, yes. Operator : Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It's Tim O'Shea for Brian. Just given the strong competitive launch in some of the new hardware on the horizon, I'm wondering if you can give us a high-level sense for what you're seeing at retail? To what extent do you see consumers trimming the spend? And I'm just curious if the EA SPORTS upgrade program might address some of this behavior. And then, quickly, do you think that we could ever expect to see this type of upgrade plan for other games, like Battlefield? Peter Robert Moore : Yes, Tim, this is Peter. Certainly, what we're seeing now at retail is a great expectation on next-gen. In fact, I was in retail yesterday, and you can see, if you guys -- you all visit, how retailers, the big box guys like Walmart and Best Buy, the specialty guys like Gamesoft are getting ready for next-gen. I want to remind everyone on the call, this is the first time that we've had 2 major console launches in the same couple of weeks, never happened before with a magnitude that we're seeing. If you're paying any attention at all, I know you are on television, you're starting to see Microsoft and Sony gear up to what should be a massive investment in marketing over the period between now and the holidays. And I think retailers in particular are starting to see that. You've seen a recent AAA launch when you have the right content that catches the imagination of gamers blow through the roof. And I think that bodes well for retail. Certainly, we are enjoying the fact that they have clearly had a very strong month and that gives them the bullishness and the investment level to be able to invest, going forward, both in current-gen and next-gen. But I, for one, couldn't be more excited about what I'm feeling right now in the marketplace. Retailers around the world are gearing up with great anticipation. And our partners at Sony and Microsoft are about, I believe, to embark upon a level of unprecedented spend that we'd never seen in this industry yet, so I think it's all coming together very, very well. Blake J. Jorgensen: And just a clarification, that is if I understood your question, we have upgrade programs on sports titles. We also have it on Battlefield 4 for Sony that's running through their program for Gen3 to Gen4 upgrade. Peter Robert Moore : Yes, and just to be clear on that, if everybody's not familiar, it's a way of allowing consumers to invest in current-gen and yet protecting their investment if and when they get a next-gen box, in which in most cases, they can spend $9.99 and get the next-gen version of the same game. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. So our programs are 2-fold, one is to protect people, the Ultimate Team investment, as it transitions from Gen3 to Gen4, as well as to upgrade people with the physical title or electronic title from Gen3 to Gen4. Operator : Our last question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : 2 quick ones here. Blake, regarding the op margin target, you kind of reiterated, you've been pushing towards 20%-plus. Not to kind of put you on the spot, but would you be willing to offer under what kind of timeframe do you think about achieving that range of op margin? And then the other question on Battlefield. Obviously, Battlefield 4 shipped today, so I know you don't want to talk about Battlefield 5, but it would be important for fiscal '15. Can you just provide some thoughts on why it would or would not make sense to annualize Battlefield, versus coming out with another first-person shooter to fill its place every other year? Blake J. Jorgensen: Well, I'll take a crack at the first part of the question and then I'll let Patrick, since he's the guy who's got to build it. I'll let Patrick answer the second part. So on the op margin, we've talked publicly about our goal of moving our operating margins into the 20s. And we've talked about that over a 3-year period without providing explicit guidance. This is the first year in that 3-year period, and we are making the right moves to start to move that number up. We obviously guided to a higher number, and we've been exceeding that in the first half of the year. We're very focused on, I would say we're all 100% aligned on making that happen. And it's a journey that we need to just continue to move on out through the next couple of years, but then on into the future. And it's going to require great products, stuff that consumers really gravitate to and love, and a huge portion of that being delivered either digitally or mobilely, as well as continuing to have built off a great franchise that we have like Battlefield and FIFA. Patrick S\u00f6derlund : Yes, this is Patrick. So when it comes to Battlefield on an annual basis, I mean, from my perspective, this is a day where we just, today launched Battlefield 4. And obviously, there's been a lot of long hours that's gone into making -- getting it into the market. And again, I think it's a major achievement from our dev teams. I don't have anything to announce. To be honest, as it relates to Battlefield, apart from the fact that we need to lick our wounds a little bit on this one, enjoy the success and then come back at a later time. Blake J. Jorgensen: We were highly conscious of the fact that if Battlefield is as successful as we believe it'll be, that, that sets ourselves up for a challenge next year. But remember, we're introducing NBA this year. We're introducing UFC next year. We have Sims next year, we would most likely, possibly have Dragon Age next year. And so a World Cup next year as well, and so there's a lot to fill, that these holes that Battlefield may create, which should be a good problem to have. But you'll hear more about our ultimate revenue and plans and title plans when we give guidance later in the year. Andrew Wilson : And when Patrick said lick his wounds, that's Swedish for enjoy the launch of what is a [indiscernible]. Blake J. Jorgensen: So thank you, everybody. Peter Robert Moore : Thanks a lot, everyone. Andrew Wilson : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion.",

In today's remarks, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360-related products will be referred to as current-gen or current-generation while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One-related products will be referred to as next-gen or next-generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Rob. In the third quarter of fiscal year '14, we had the unprecedented excitement of 2 new game consoles launching within weeks of each other. With that came the challenge of launching a full slate of EA's top titles for both next-gen and the current-gen consoles. In terms of our quarterly performance, on the top line, we generated $1.57 billion in non-GAAP revenue, which was below our guidance of $1.65 billion. As others have noted, industry sales of major games for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles declined in Q3 at a faster-than-anticipated rate, and that softness was the primary driver of our revenue shortfall in Q3. This shortfall will impact our full year revenue guidance, and we are now forecasting our annual revenues to be $3.91 billion. What's exciting for us looking forward is the uptake of next-gen consoles has been faster than we expected. The launches of the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One proved to be strong new catalysts for the console gaming market. The 6 titles we released with the launch of the next-generation consoles; FIFA 14, Battlefield 4, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, NBA LIVE 14 and Peggle 2, collectively sold above expectations and exceeded our Q3 forecasts. As a result, we have taken an early leadership position on the next-gen consoles. Based on NPD December results in the U.S., EA achieved 40% segment share on the PlayStation 4 and 30% segment share on the Xbox One, and our estimates indicate we garnered similar shares in Europe. On average, every gamer in Europe that bought a next-gen console is playing one of EA's next-gen games. We're exceptionally proud to have been the #1 publisher on next-gen consoles in December, with millions of gamers playing EA titles on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One across the globe. The popularity of our next-gen games has allowed us to benefit from this early growth, as illustrated by our segment share numbers. Looking forward, our goal is to keep our next-gen games fresh through live services, driving sales through Q4 and beyond as more gamers shift to the new consoles. We also have a robust pipeline in front of us as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 player bases continue to grow. EA's digital transition also continues at full speed. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue, including mobile, full-game downloads and live services was up 27% year-over-year, and we are on track to exceed our guidance of $1.7 billion in digital revenue for FY '14. Inside our digital portfolio, December was EA's biggest month ever for mobile downloads, with over 71 million game downloads across the App Store and Google Play, the most of any game publisher worldwide. The Simpsons : Tapped Out reached a record level of daily active users during the holiday quarter, and The Sims FreePlay, a game that launched over 2 years ago, delivered its largest-ever month of revenue in December. These milestones demonstrate how mobile continues to be a fantastic opportunity for EA's expansion and revenue growth. We are further strengthened by our financial discipline during this fiscal year. We continue to manage our costs and remain on track to lower our expenses year-over-year, an impressive achievement in a console transition cycle. However, this is not just an effort for FY '14. Long-term operating profit growth will continue to be an ongoing focus. Benefiting from our position on next-gen consoles, digital growth and continued cost management, our Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 exceeded our expectations by $0.04 per share, and we are raising full-year EPS guidance today by $0.05 to $1.30 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Before I turn the call over to Blake to give additional details of our financial performance, a quick word on one of the most talked about titles of Q3, Battlefield 4. Launching Battlefield was a complex effort, with our teams at DICE delivering a massive game packed with innovative new features for players on next-gen consoles, current-gen consoles and PC. Shortly after Battlefield 4 went live, we began hearing from some players in the community who were experiencing issues with the game. The Battlefield team acted swiftly to address the issues through game updates, and they continue to make refinements as part of our live service to ensure a great game experience for all Battlefield 4 players. Battlefield 4 is an amazing game in size, scope and gameplay, and we're confident that gamers will be playing for a long time to come. Q3 was an exciting start to a new generation of games, a great quarter for digital growth and another positive step towards increasing operating profits. The stage is now properly set for the conclusion of our fiscal year, as well as the long-term opportunity in front of EA. Over to you, Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. Turning to our Q3 results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.57 billion, which was below our guidance but 33% higher than last year. Our revenue growth over Q3 last year was driven by Battlefield 4, FIFA 14, Madden NFL 25 and NHL 14. And as a note, we deferred $36 million into Q4 from programs that allowed consumers to upgrade from current-generation titles to next-generation titles. Our Q3 revenue shortfall was driven by a much sharper decline than anticipated for demand -- in demand for next-generation or current-generation software, excuse me. The industry showed signs of current-gen software market weakness in the third quarter, and in December, the U.S. NPD results reflected that trend with PS3 and Xbox 360 software sales declining 35% versus the prior year. Our quarterly results were negatively impacted by this trend, and some of our key titles, such as Battlefield 4, FIFA 14 and Need for Speed Rivals came in below our expectation for current-gen revenues. This downward trend on current-gen software was partially offset by our positive next-gen results, and fortunately, this plays well for our future. Our Xbox One and PlayStation 4 software sales were well ahead of our expectations, led by FIFA 14, Need for Speed Rivals and Battlefield 4. Sales of each of these titles on next-gen platforms exceeded our forecast. Based on estimates, EA titles represented 35% of the Western World next-gen software market in the third quarter, and EA was the #1 publisher on PS4 and Xbox One in December. Q3 non-GAAP digital net revenue continues to grow over the prior year. Digital net revenue increased by 27% year-over-year to $517 million. Trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 27% over the prior year to a record $1.86 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $213 million, up 15% over the prior year, led by the continued growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, FIFA Online 3 and Star Wars : The Old Republic. Our year-to-date results for all of our Ultimate Team services; FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL Hockey, continued to demonstrate revenue growth year-over-year. Extra content growth was partially offset by our decision to sunset several of our social titles. Second, our mobile business generated $125 million for the quarter, up 26% over the prior year and 19% over the prior quarter. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent the majority of the revenue, accounting for $110 million of the $125 million total, and growing 39% year-over-year. Third, full game downloads added $113 million, up 157% over the prior year. This was largely driven by the launch of Battlefield 4 on PC in the quarter. And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $66 million, down 16% over the same period last year. This was driven by a decline in POGO subscription and advertising revenue and a decline in Star Wars : The Old Republic subscription revenue as the fleet free-to-play offering continues to grow. Moving on to gross margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 68.1%, up over last year's 65.7% and in-line with our guidance. The improvement was due to our product mix shift, as well as the growth in digital, lower transaction fees as we move away from the social business, and the benefits of our new digital platform. Operating expenses for the quarter were $540 million, up 11% from last year and $60 million lower than our guidance. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 34%, compared to 45% in the prior year. Our improving operating expense leverage illustrates the success of our cost control programs, as we continue to drive our operating margins above 20%, while remaining focused on investing in future growth. The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $1.26 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $1.22 per share. Our EPS came in above our guidance due to our continued efforts to focus R&D investments on high-return opportunities and managing our marketing expenses through greater performance-based advertising strategies. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.07 billion or approximately $6.70 per share. Roughly 60% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held outside of the U.S. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $685 million compared to $363 million in the prior year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 666 -- or $664 million. This is the highest trailing 12-month operating cash flow for EA since 2005. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. Now turning to guidance. With respect to our Q4 guidance, GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.07 billion, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.72. Our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $800 million. This estimate factors in the steeper-than-anticipated declines we saw in current-gen software revenues. Also as a reminder, in Q4 last year, we launched 5 core titles and recognized the full year's Battlefield 3 Premium subscription revenue. This year, we will be launching 2 titles in the quarter and recording Battlefield 4 Premium subscription revenue on a ratable basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 71%, down against the prior Q4 gross margin of 74%. Our forecast in Q4 includes $36 million of revenue deferred from Q3 for promotional upgrade programs. As a reminder, last year's higher gross margin was attributable to the recognition of all of the Battlefield 3 Premium subscription revenue in the fourth quarter. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $525 million. Our operating expenses will be impacted by our planned marketing and advertising for our key titles on next-gen. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.09 per share. For the full year, non-GAAP revenue is now estimated to be $3.91 billion and gross margin is expected to be 66%. Due to the favorable results of our continued cost control efforts, we are now estimating operating expenses to be reduced to approximately $2.04 billion, and we are raising our EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1.30 per share. The GAAP guidance is estimated to be $3.52 billion in revenue and a loss per share of $0.42. As we have pointed out in past quarters, our consumers are playing our games online over longer periods of time, and this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue, which will drive the deferral of an incremental $385 million of net revenue into fiscal '15. This longer service period has no impact on our non-GAAP revenue or cash flows. Regarding cash flow, we are raising our estimates for fiscal '14 operating cash flow to approximately $600 million. This implies expected free cash flow generation of approximately $500 million, which is up $200 million from our previous guidance and more than twice what we generated in fiscal '13. Regarding fiscal year '15, we will provide guidance during our Q4 earnings call, when we will be in a much better position to share our insights. At that time, we will give you our title slate for the year and our expected financial guidance, which will be a continuation of our multi-year plan of improving operating profits and cash flow. In summary, we were able to weather the decline in current-gen software sales by actively managing our operating expenses while still investing in the development of our next-gen products, services, future IP, earnings and cash flow. We are encouraged by our initial software sales from PS4 and Xbox One. And going forward, we remain committed to extending our leadership position in next-gen console software development, growing our digital games and services and continuing to improve our operating profits. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. Just a few thoughts to close. We are proud to have been the #1 publisher on next-gen consoles in December, with more new games on the way. Our digital businesses are reaching new heights across multiple platforms and geographies, and cost discipline measures are protecting our returns so we can invest in key IP for the future. We're all incredibly excited for the arrival of Titanfall on March 11. Our partners at Respawn Entertainment are now putting the finishing touches on this highly anticipated title for Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC. There is -- this is a spectacularly innovative game, a true achievement by the teams at Respawn. Across EA Studios, development continues on plan for our future titles, and we'll share more of our FY '15 slate on our next quarterly call. We expect digital growth to continue as a defining characteristic of this fiscal year for Electronic Arts. Players are engaging deeper each year in digital live services for some of our established franchises like FIFA Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, and now, Battlefield 4 Premium, which currently has more than 1.6 million members. Digital is also accelerating our growth in new markets. FIFA Online 3 is doing extremely well in Korea in both traffic and revenue, and we expect more fans to connect with our online free-to-play FIFA games in China and Latin America during the World Cup this year. EA's mobile titles continue to rise up the chart and demonstrate our ability to build a portfolio of great games and grow them over time. Games like The Simpsons : Tapped Out, FIFA 14, Real Racing 3 and The Sims FreePlay have highly engaged fan bases on iOS and Android that are still growing long after launch. Our recently launched Heros of Dragon Age is another excellent example of an entirely new mobile experience designed around one of our proven IPs. Our strength in mobile is in our ability to repeat on success and we see more strong opportunities ahead. Throughout FY '14, we've been demonstrating our ability to grow operating profits, and we expect strong returns from this increased focus on discipline across our business. This is a multi-year journeys striving for both top line revenue growth and profitability improvement, and one that we are fully committed to for the long term. By executing against our strategic priorities, we look forward to closing our FY '14 in a position of strength. We're delivering exciting new experiences to our gamers every day, and we are ready to capitalize on the long-term opportunity in front of us. With that, Blake, Peter, Patrick and I are here to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird Co. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : A couple of questions. First, after the follow-up on Battlefield 4, if you could comment on current sales trends of the game and whether server issues had any noticeable impact on sell-through or reorders? And then secondly, Andrew, maybe since you have a few months now under the belt as CEO. Curious, where you've identified some of the key early learnings about EA from the top? And strategically, where you think there's still more work to be done? Peter Robert Moore : Colin, it's Peter. Let me take the first part of that question, then I'll hand it over to Andrew. As both Blake and Andrew indicated, we obviously saw some decline in current-gen software that wasn't picked up by the increased anticipation that gamers have in the sales thereof of next-gen. Battlefield 4 was no different than FIFA or Need for Speed in this issue but this was focused on current gen rather than, we believe, any issues with the game itself. This game has got a long tail, as you well know, and we will continue to be able to sell this effectively throughout the next fiscal year. So yes, we did see some impact of the current-gen softness that was indicated by Andrew and Blake in their prepared statements, but this is not, we believe, linked to any quality issues. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Colin. In terms of learnings in the job, I'd reiterate what I've been saying to this point, which is, I think as a company, we have an amazing portfolio of IP, and we're starting to see that really resonate both with new console gamers on these next-gen platforms, on mobile with titles that have been very strong for us in the past, things like Heroes of Dragon Age and now certainly PC free-to-play in emerging markets, with things like FIFA Online 3 in Korea. And so for me, our strategy continues to be sound. We have to go strongly after the next-gen market. I think we're in a strong position there. We certainly have the opportunity to benefit from the World Cup this year, with respect to FIFA Online free-to-play games across the globe. And mobile continues to be a very, very strong strategic opportunity for us and we are doubling down and investing heavily in that space to ensure that we've got our AAA teams look -- and our AAA IP to bring great games and services to users on those platforms across the globe. Operator : The next question comes from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a couple of questions. First of all, can you give us some color as to what you think we should be looking for as far as the rate of decline in PS3 and 360 sales are concerned? As a follow-up to that, how clear do you think the inventory levels are for that legacy software in the retail channel? And then looking at the next-generation, can you give us some color so your kind of attach rates, and what we should expect for digital sales for the next-gen software? Peter Robert Moore : Ed, it's Peter. Let me try and plow through that. Certainly, as we, again to reiterate, we've seen, obviously, a decline in what we anticipate and I think what the industry anticipated in current-gen once next-gen launched. We will continue to monitor this. You and I have been through these transitions many times, and you continued to re-forecast as you see trends. I will say this, both Sony and Microsoft recognized, in particular, Sony, have managed their PS2 to PS3 transition very well. Having ran that Xbox business, as you know, I think Microsoft is committed to the Xbox 360 for a number of years. So I would anticipate seeing both Sony and Microsoft get behind their current-gen platforms at least for the next 2 years and bring us to a 10-year cycle as we saw in the previous cycle. As regard to inventories, difficult for me to speak other than our own. As I think Blake alluded to, we have put some reserves aside to make sure that we are able to do the correct promotional activities in Q4 and beyond to move any inventory issues that we have to keep retail shelves fresh and make sure we've got room for our new titles in FY '15. And then as regards to next-gen, the tie ratios, I'm actually pretty bullish on what I'm seeing so far. Certainly, Sony has done well with the PS4 at -- when you compare it to the first 2 months of their launch on the PS3. They're up to 2.1 versus 1.9. Microsoft is a little down, the 2.6 attach on Xbox One versus Xbox 360, and this is U.S. only, during that similar period for launch, but I think a lot of that has to do with the some of the bundling activity we saw on a global basis, but certainly here in the U.S. I think it's been a solid start for both and we're incredibly bullish that, that will continue in FY '15. Blake J. Jorgensen: And Ed, just to be crystal clear here on inventory, we regularly assess our reserves and our channel inventory, and we're truing up any reserve that we believe are required to maintain a clear channel. Part of our lower revenue in Q3 is driven by the fact that we put reserves on to make sure that we had a very clean inventory channel, and we're very comfortable with that even with the decline in the Gen3 sales that have been existing. Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then have you seen any lift, anything noticeable yet with the regards to the digital sales of full games for next-gen consoles? Peter Robert Moore : Ed, it's Peter again. I think it's a little early. I mean, certainly, digital extra content, full game downloads is something we watch and something that we're keeping a very close eye on. I think what you see, typically, in the first couple of months is that consumers have gone to retail to pick up their boxes, and as a result, they probably bought the packaged goods version of that software. I think it's a good question for 12 months from now when we have a full year of data behind us. And it's also probably a more appropriate question for Sony and Microsoft to be able to speak to with PSN and Xbox LIVE, respectively. Operator : Next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I wonder if you can speak to what's going on with your contract with the NFL. I believe it's now expired, and obviously, people are expecting another Madden game in 2014. So could you just talk about where that is? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Contrary to some reports, we still have a number of years left on our agreements there and are currently in planning on the next Madden property right now. And we expect to make a number of Madden games in the future, and the relationship that we have with both the NFL and the NFL Players Association continues to be extremely strong. Operator : The next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Just a couple of questions. You guys talked about the Ultimate Team revenue is up 60%. In the past, you guys have been kind enough to share some details on the FIFA and Battlefield side of things. Wonder if you could update on the dollar figures for that? And then as far as the market is concerned, I think, Peter, you had alluded to your bullishness on the next-gen. At this point, do you feel like the 10 million unit console for next-gen by March, is that looking like it might be higher than that or you think it's 10 million by March? Peter Robert Moore : I don't know if it is 10 million, Arvind, right on the nose. But I stand by my comments, I think it's going to actually be in excess of that and I'm feeling pretty good about what I'm seeing and hearing and visiting retail and listening to retailers talk about their flow of inventory. I think you can see, you do the store checks. Both Sony and Microsoft seems to be doing a pretty darn good job of flowing inventory in between now and from what I've seen, certainly, by the end of our fiscal quarter on March 31. I think it's 10 million-plus, Arvind. Blake J. Jorgensen: On the extra content, we're not going to break out the FIFA Ultimate Team versus other Ultimate Teams. But what you can see on the documents that have been published is that the extra content revenue for the quarter was up to $213 million, which is up 15%. Our original guidance for the year there was that would be relatively flat so we're clearly exceeding our expectations. And part of that exceeding the expectations is that we've improved the Ultimate Team offering for all of the sport. So while FIFA continues to grow, we're seeing great growth out of Madden NFL as well as NHL Hockey, and it's really improving the overall Ultimate Team experience. On top of that, also in that category, is the growth of FIFA Online 3, which is primarily a free-to-play business in Korea and soon to be in China, that's growing extremely well and is very popular in Korea. And Andrew might have some more detail on that, that he can provide. But we're very excited about, clearly, that whole component. And I think as people know, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're already over $700 million there, and we foresee that business continuing to grow year-over-year in the levels that it has over the last couple of years. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And then I guess on Battlefield 4 Premium, I wonder if you could give us some color on the early response there. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes. So early days in Battlefield 4 Premium, as you know, most people buy the original game and then they sign up for Premium. Just as a reminder, from a financial standpoint and I can let Patrick talk about the product, we are recognizing Battlefield 4 Premium differently than we did Battlefield 3 Premium. As you know, we've recognized Battlefield 3 Premium at the end of program in one quarter. Now we're recognizing it ratably. There are 5 expansion packs that are scheduled to be released over the next year, and we plan to ratably recognize that revenue. So if you were to purchase something when the Premium first went out, say in October, when we first rolled out Battlefield, that purchase would be amortized over 15 months. If you were to purchase it in November, it would have been amortized over 14 months and so forth as we get to the end of the revenue. It will all be dropped into digital subscription revenue, so you'll see it in that part of the breakout of our financial statements. But I think it will be a lot smoother in terms of the revenue recognition versus what you saw before. Patrick S\u00f6derlund : This is Patrick. On the product side, I think it's important to point out that Battlefield 4 Premium has just started. We have 1 map pack in the channel. There's another 1 coming shortly. And I think there's a lot of exciting content being built right now, that I think will excite people. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : A couple of Titanfall questions. Given Titanfall is going to be the first major new franchise for next-gen when it launches in March, just in general, how are you thinking about forecasting that title in your March quarter outlook? Could you kind of describe your approach to Titanfall as aggressive, conservative or somewhere in between as far as how you're thinking about it? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, I guess I would call it conservative. We, as a reminder, Titanfall is just on Xbox One and Xbox 360 and the PC. And so by that nature, it's smaller as an overall product. We're very excited about the product. Respawn has done an amazing job with it. But as a reminder, also, we'll be shipping it the tail end of the quarter, middle of March. And so essentially, the March revenue or the quarter revenue is primarily the first sell-in of that title. We expect the title to be very additive to us also in FY '15. You'll hear more about that when we give our '15 guidance. But it's really a starting point in Q4 this year and then we'll play well into next year as more and more people build the base of Xbox Ones or build or play the title either on 360 or PC. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : That exclusive that you mentioned was the other question is obviously, leaving out the PlayStation impacts the addressable market to some degree, and I realize you can't talk about specifics of the economics around your deal with Microsoft on there. But can you just talk, conceptually, about whether or not the economics are kind of enough to offset potential sales that the game could've had on PlayStation and -- or just, high level, how kind of these deals work? Blake J. Jorgensen: Well, I think you should assume that we made that decision when it was back a few years ago when we decided to go exclusive. We had some forecast at that time from where we thought both Xbox and PlayStation would be and that's what we based our decision on. I think we're still feeling very comfortable with that. I think -- think about the deal as economically as we made. We told people last quarter that it's a trade-off between The Sims 4, which is the product we moved out when we moved Titanfall in. And the reason that's economically neutral on that deal in this year is that most of the expenses for the development of Respawn's products were expensed along the way, as we do with all of our R&D. And thus, when we ship that product, it's fairly high margin for us until we start to share royalties with them. You should assume in FY '15, we'll start to share royalties as the revenue builds, and that will start to reduce the profitability of the product over time. But the initial ship-in at the volumes that we're anticipating and built into our guidance are fairly profitable, and we determine it was a exact trade-off with The Sims profitability if that would've also been in the quarter. Operator : James Hardiman with Longbow Research. James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC : Quick follow-up on Battlefield. Just wanted to check and make sure that at this point, are all the issues that you were having early on, sort of in the rearview mirror at this point? And as I think about some of the issues that you had, are there lessons learned there that give you confidence that you won't have similar issues with Titanfall, given it's another multiplayer cross-generational game? And then I had a follow-up for Blake. Andrew Wilson : Let me -- I would just -- I'd take that one, I think it's a great question. Look, on the Titanfall piece -- I'll hand off to Patrick to give you a little more color on Battlefield 4. What I would tell you about Titanfall is we are incredibly excited for the release of the product. And to partner with experienced world-class teams of both Respawn and Microsoft to launch a title. We're currently moving through kind of public tests of the product, and we're seeing great results and we're really looking forward to seeing the gamer reaction in March. Patrick S\u00f6derlund : I'll cover Battlefield 4, and I'll quickly touch on kind of what happened, what we've done and how we're learning from it? So on the first segment, the what happened part is when Battlefield 4 launched, it was a very complex game, launching on 2 entirely new console platforms, as well as current-gen and PC. We were pushing innovation heavily and we're delivering 60 frames per second gameplay for 64 players plus the ability to connect via mobile tablet as a commander into the product, coupled those with some very innovative features in the gameplay side. Based on our prelaunch testing, our beta performance, we were confident the game was ready when it was launched. Shortly after launch, however, we began hearing about problems from our player community, and the development team quickly began to address the situation. So what have we done since we encountered the problems is we were fortunate to have an architecture in place that allows us to adjust and update the game rapidly, and that's actually what we've done. We released multiple software updates across all platforms to resolve the primary issues and game stability has significantly increased. To the final point, which is how are we learning from this? The challenge that we've faced with Battlefield 4 were different from anything that we've seen before with other games. There were different issues that only manifest its scale in the post-launch live environment. We're taking multiple steps to evaluate what occurred and incorporate those learnings into our development process for future products, so we don't experience the same problems again. I would close on the fact that Battlefield 4 remains an amazing game with massive innovation, and we're confident that gamers will be logging on to play for a long time to come. James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC : That's really helpful. And then I had a question for Blake. Blake, I sort of feel like a good portion of your script every quarter, you could probably cut and paste because it seems like every quarter, you're beating on the OpEx line by a pretty sizable margin. So I guess my question is, how much of that is a function of realizing those savings earlier than you had initially anticipated? And how much of that, if any, is that there's actually a bigger opportunity with respect to your ultimate margin potential that you've sort of laid out over the past year, 1.5 years? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, so I guess I'll restate your first part, which is not only are we beating on OpEx, I think we've been happy that we're actually beating on EPS and cash flow, which was really where we're trying to drive the beast every quarter. We've done that through trying to deliver on the top line, which we've been doing except with the minor miss in Q3, and at the same time, management -- more aggressive management of our OpEx across all parts of the organization. And I used the word management versus cost cutting because that's how we view this, and we view that there's a long opportunity ahead of us and more certainly to be able to drive our operating margins and profitability upwards. We're trying to prioritize and focus and we're trying to make sure that the entire organization is aligned with that, but we're also trying to do that so none of what we do cuts back on our future IP development and our ability to drive the top line longer term. And part of the reason that we're taking a step-by-step process over the next couple of years to continue to build our operating margins is because we are trying to protect the long-term franchise value of many of our key IPs. And we think that's a good balance and we think there is a lot of opportunity still left. I think we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be, which is good news, but we also know we've got a lot of challenges ahead. And as I mentioned, you'll see next quarter our guidance for fiscal '15, but I do think what you'll see is a continuation of the same strategy that we've all been talking about publicly to continue to build our operating margins over time. Operator : Next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : [indiscernible] [Technical Difficulties] Operator : Your next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : So I wonder if you guys could comment on the experience you've had with next-gen pricing on the full game download and what type of economics you're seeing from that? And then separately, could you comment on the your plans for digital monetization on Titanfall? Andrew Wilson : So the first question regarding next-gen, so the pricing that Sony and Microsoft determined to charge on their PSN, Xbox LIVE stores? Is that the question? Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Correct. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Obviously, that's determined by a number of factors. We are active participants in those stores and look forward, as I mentioned, in my earlier comments, to that business ultimately growing. But we do not determine prices here. There's no different than a retail store in which they will determine the prices going forward here, both Sony and Microsoft on that, as well as local authorities as well. There is also other issues in there. But is there something that you have more specific? Is your question why is it not different? Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Well, if you could address that. And then also, Peter, I'd be interested in your comments around what the economics look like, what type of margins are you getting on these full game downloads relative to the packaged goods sold at bricks-and-mortar retailer? Peter Robert Moore : Yes, I'm not going to talk about specific margins, but I think we've been pretty consistent over the years that as this industry moves to more digital downloads, that it's margin accretive for us as we start to leave behind some of the challenges sometimes that retail has. At the same time, we are selling a tremendous amount of packaged goods software, which leads to digital margins, in particular, when you think about Ultimate Team products on our sports titles and our Battlefield Premium subscriptions. One of those springboard off the disc that is typically sold at retail. So it's not a black-and-white issue of you either sell digital or you either sell packaged goods there. It's a combined economy for us in that respect and we enjoy digital margins of both our packaged good sales and our digital sales. Blake J. Jorgensen: But clearly, the growth in gross margin over the last 3 or 4 years has been driven by the movement into digital, not just full game but, obviously, all of the ancillary products. Any digital business comes in at a better margin for us because of lack of some of the physical and inventory-related expenses associated with it, as well as some of the margins you may lose or leak along the way. So we're very focused on continuing that process. But as Peter said, we're also trying to balance that with making sure our products get into all the people's hands that want them and we can do that through a lot of our great retail partners out there. Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. Then on Titanfall, guys, any comment you can make around digital monetization for that title? Andrew Wilson : Yes. So Titanfall again is a highly innovative game, multiplayer-driven, and so expect a lot of online engagement around that. We're planning extra content already for the product, but in the nature of the live service, I think that, that will evolve over time as we see how the player base evolves through the year. Operator : Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Andrew, so as you think about taking some of your franchise and thinking console plus online experiences, if you start the development process of the outset to coexist on both, do you have some sense as to how much your development costs may be higher or lower or flat or whatever, as a result of on -- as a result on a franchise-by-franchise basis versus just developing for the console? And am I reading too much into your comment a little earlier about China and Latin America free-to-play FIFA ahead of the World Cup as perhaps an imminent signing of the distribution deal for maybe Brazil or other territories? Peter Robert Moore : Okay. So I'll hit that both. First is the cost of development around cross-platform and the second with respect to FIFA Online in China and Brazil around the World Cup. As it relates to cross-platform development, I think something that is really starting to play under the strength of EA is this move to cross-platform play and the need for cross-platform development. So as a company, we've started to invest on a number of levels, over the past 3 or 4 years, that really help facilitate this transition for us. One is the investment in our digital platform at a core ID logging entitlement security data platform level, which again is universal across the company and lowers the cost barrier as you start out development. The second is the move to more common engines and you've heard a lot from us around Frostbite 3 and Ignite technology. And we continue to try and converge our Engine technology to the extent that our game teams aren't having to spend a lot of time, effort, energy and investment around the core game technology like physics, animation, rendering, audio, et cetera. And what that really does is frees up the game teams on a couple of fronts. One, it gives them the ability to outsource commodity like investment by virtue of common technology; and two, focus really their core-driven innovation around feature development as it relates to each platform. And the net of all of that is what we're seeing is fairly significant economies of scale as the player base across platform evolves and we start to deliver these experiences across platform. Second, as it relates to FIFA Online 3 and the World Cup, so we have announced a deal in China, and we've also announced that we are rolling out FIFA Online world, which is a slightly different manifestation but built on exactly the same engine for Brazil and Russia. We will be driving that inside the company with a full self-publishing opportunity. So we will maintain all of the value chain in those territories. So very excited about that, a great step for us as a company as we think about PC free-to-play in those emerging markets. Operator : The next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Justin Post, your line is open with Bank of America. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is Ryan calling in for Justin. First question's on Battlefield and Titanfall and the digital strategy behind those 2. I know you haven't talked too much about the Titanfall digital. But I'm -- we're wondering if those 2 titles can coexist next year. Also there's other first-person shooter games out there, how the dynamic will work? And then also as you look out for fiscal '15, what does the weakness in prior-gen software mean for revenues next year, particularly as it relates to catalogue usually and you do see a big -- or you still see healthy sales in sports titles and some of the holiday games next year, what that current-gen software weakness means? Peter Robert Moore : Ryan, it's Peter. Let me try and address that first question on Titanfall. Actually, the question -- the answer is yes. I think they can both coexist. We haven't talked at detail about our Titanfall digital strategy, but you're very familiar already, obviously, with Battlefield 4 Premium. We expect that to be incredibly strong for us as is Battlefield 4 typically as a catalogue title itself. Once we announce Titanfall, obviously, you'll have a better understanding what our digital strategy is. But I think they can both coexist very easily and then we think they will be both incremental and accretive to what we're going to be doing in FY '15. As regards to revenue, we're not prepared yet to talk about that. That will be on the next earnings call, and I think we'll be, obviously, 90 days better educated by the time we get there once Blake is able to disclose what our revenue's going to be for FY '15 in the next earnings call. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, I do say that -- I will say that we'll most likely be cautious around Gen3 for some period of time because until pricing for the all Gen3 or current-generation boxes gets settled down, it's hard to guess exactly if that will bring new consumers in or not. I do think we're still in a bit of an air pocket right now between the new consoles coming out and the old consoles, where many of the consumers are still waiting on the sidelines. And that's why you haven't seen 1 :1 replacement in software. Our assumption is that it will start to go away over time, and it will settle into a normal Gen3 business. We still ship some Gen2 software, so we think Gen3 will be around for some period of time. And we think it'll be a viable part of our catalog going forward, and it could grow if for some reason the prices came down on the current-gen forefront -- or Gen3 consoles and brought new consumers into the market in places around the world that have not yet had access to the boxes. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then, Blake, kind of going back to the cost savings this quarter, I was wondering if you could summarize maybe 1 or 2 of the specific measures you took during the quarter that really drove those savings. And whether or not it's reasonable to carry forward the magnitude of 3Q savings into next year? Or if there's something maybe competition or product roadmap that limits that ability. Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, I mean, we'll give you a lot of detail around that next quarter when we do guidance. But I think you should assume is that we're trying to change the way we're operating. And so that means organizational changes, that means the way we go to market, that means how we actually do advertising, and that means prioritization of our product portfolio. We're trying to make sure that we fully invest in the key properties and stop investing in some properties that don't look like they have the opportunity to become the size that we would like or the scale that we would like. And I think we're also getting better at how we invest in those properties. And so even as we look forward, we should be able to, based on consistent engines across properties, for example, be able to continue to bring our overall development cost down. And you'll continue to see that built into our cost structure and, thus, expanding of our margins, over time, with limited upside on the revenue. And if we get bigger revenue upside, that will even be that much larger margin expansion. Peter Robert Moore : Yes, Ryan, this is Peter. If I can maybe address marketing. I mean, to be the leader the we currently are as publisher in the next-generation, you've got to be next-generation marketer to be able to match that up. And the marketing teams around the world are moving very rapidly into more performance-based marketing. We're not a traditional marketer anymore. We're utilizing 1 :1 marketing techniques with the digital and, ultimately, more cost-effective for us and more relevant to the consumer. You're going to see continued efficiencies in that area for us, at the same time, not losing any impact of share of voice with the consumer. Operator : Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division : Andrew, just kind of curious, looks like the last couple of months, there's been some executive turnover on the development side. I'm wondering kind of what you're doing to set the culture and retain talent. Andrew Wilson : Listen, I think that's a great question, and certainly that one that we think about here. As a company, we're a creative organization. I came up through the creative side of the organization. So I have a deep passion for both bringing in new creative talent and keeping with creative talent. But that also, as part of the creative industry, people come and go for all kinds of different reasons. You've seen some recently have left, and these changes happen to be announced in the short window, which was more coincidental than anything. I know it's absolutely no connection between their departures. EA, as an organization, we've got over 8,000 amazingly talented and creative people, and we love to see these people have the opportunity to step up and lead our studios. Guys like John Vechey at PopCap, Matt Webster of Criterion, and Ed Rumley at Chillingo have all been with their respective studios for a long time and bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm and new creative thinking to their roles. I don't know whether anyone saw the piece that Matt Webster did. He did a great interview with IGN early this week were he talked about the passion and energy and the creative DNA inside of Criterion and what they're doing for the future. In fact, we're going to get to talk about some new things out of Criterion a little later in the year. But this is really important for us. These studios all have exciting work underway and we look forward to sharing all of it with players in the future. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division : Last question, it looks like '14 will be interesting in the living room. It looks Steam should officially launch their product and it's still early days, but some of it looks compelling. We have Apple, Amazon and Google, all kind of rumored to be potentially launching a micro-console and kind of connecting that mobile eco-system to the TV. So just curious how you think how disruptive that could be and how that market can take shape for you or not? Andrew Wilson : Listen, I think it's great. I mean, every time there are new ways and opportunities for people to play games, that's great for us and it's great for our ability to bring new and innovative experiences to our gamers. EA is and has always been kind of a platform-agnostic company. We do our best to bring great experiences to gamers on whatever platforms they're playing on. So right now we think about our world kind of in 3 modalities of play, the lean-back experience in the living room, the lean-in experience with PC and free-to-play, particularly, in emerging markets and the lean-over experience on mobile as that is such a growing part of the gaming community, the gaming ecosystem. As it relates to specific technology, we're watching eagerly but we see that more as our ability to manifest those 3 modalities of play. And we'll work with each of those partners to deliver great games and services to gamers in the modality of play that makes most sense for them. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Schachter, Macquarie. Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research : Blake, on FY '15, I know you're not giving explicit guidance, but if you could just give us any color on general trends. Is it fair to expect continued margin growth and EPS growth there or do we have to wait until '15 to hear that? And then just on the competitive landscape on mobile, what are you learning there? I mean, why are The Simpsons still doing so well but Plants vs. Zombies didn't do as well as you thought? What can we understand around some of the sustainable competitive advantages there? Blake J. Jorgensen: Yes, let me tackle the '15 question and then I'll let Andrew talk about the mobile question and Peter, if you want to jump in as well. What I did say in my remarks was that we'd give our, obviously, our details next quarter but that it would be a continuation of our multiyear plan for improving operating profit and cash flow. I've talked publicly about a multiyear strategy to get us into the 20% operating margin levels. We've been delivering on that every quarter. We're ahead of our plan on that, as I think you can tell, just by looking at our guidance numbers, that's up from what we originally guided for the full year. And I think you'll continue to see more of that next year. I'll give you details but assume that it is #1 focus for everything we're doing, along with building great products for gamers to make sure that we really deliver excitement around mobile and console gaming. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And listen, as it relates to mobile, I think it's a great question. Certainly, as you've heard from us, it's something that we're very, very focused on and working diligently again right now as a company. And it continues to be a fantastic opportunity for expansion and revenue growth within our digital portfolio as we really drive the focus in this area. And I think early into what we're learning right now is that brands matter in this market. And we have tapped the power of the EA network, the brands within it, partner placement, the relationships we have with our partners, to really drive some incredibly strong IP. And we've demonstrated that with things like The Simpsons : Tapped Out, which continues to grow for us and has topped over $130 million life-to-date in digital net revenue. We continue to drive updates to that game. I think that, that's what we've learned is that ongoing progressive content that keeps experience fresh and exciting for gamers is important. Real Racing 3 has over 100 million downloads since launch, and again, it comes down to great IP, great game mechanic but also providing that extended and enhanced service. That team works diligently around continuing to upgrade and extend the product. Sims FreePlay, again, just a phenomenal brand for us, has over 87 million life-to-date installs. And 2 years post its launch saw its biggest revenue month inside of December. And so again, it's that mobile isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. These live service businesses, it's really important that you continue to work with your gamer base and grow the gamer base and provide them a really exciting experience over the long term that connects them with their friends and connect them with the experience. And again, now we're seeing that with Heroes of Dragon Age. And so we feel like now that we've learned how to acquire mobile gamers though our IP, the next step is really to follow the market monetization trends and really drive and reach those top grossing games. We've got some work to do, but we are making strides as we lower the barrier to entry to our games, increase the quality and manage what is a very exciting experiences for our gamers. Operator : That last question comes from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Neil A. Doshi - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Blake, on the marketing and sales side, we saw some very nice leverage there. Do you think you can continue to demonstrate that type of leverage on a go forward basis? And then secondly on the FIFA Online for China, can you just update us where you guys are in that process? And what are some of the additional steps needed to get that game ultimately approved and launched in China? Blake J. Jorgensen: Sure. The first question I'll answer, and then let Andrew give you the FIFA answer. We do feel confident that there's more leverage there. We're really trying to drive more of the business to both digital, as well as use as much performance-based marketing activities. And the combination of those, I think, continues to show leverage off of the existing cost base, and then clearly leveraging the R&D expense line around prioritization but also using more standardized tools that allow us to really have the artist focus on building great games and not worrying about how the back office or platform operates. So more to come on that as we give our '15 guidance, but we do feel pretty confident that there's more opportunity. Andrew Wilson : With respect to FIFA Online 3 in China, as we've announced, we have a relationship with Tencent where we are working kind of hand-in-hand on the development, publishing and launch of this title. The core engine comes out of our EAC Studios, so you can expect that the gameplay is going to be top class. We are actually driving a lot of the meta-service layer out of our EA Korea studio, which again has been responsible for FIFA Online 3 work, with Nexon there and continues it exceptionally well and then partnering with Tencent in China on the publishing of that title. And for anyone who kind of understands the life cycle of a free-to-play property, there are a series of technical tests, closed betas and open betas, as you move into commercialization and you gradually scale the business over time with respect to feature set and user numbers, and we are in the middle of that process with Tencent right now and on plan for our target launch of this year. Blake J. Jorgensen: With that, I think we'll wrap up the call. Appreciate everyone's time and attention and look forward to talking to everyone next quarter. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

I\u2019m pleased to be here reporting on a great fourth quarter and capping up a strong fiscal 2014 for Electronic Arts. EAs performance in FY14 was above expectations. In the fourth quarter we delivered revenue an EPS above our guidance. We also exceeded our full year guidance by generating $4.02 billion in non-GAAP revenue and delivering a $1.69 in EPS, doubling our EPS from FY13.  The introduction of two new consoles, continued growth in the mobile gaming audience and new modalities of play across the world combined to make the last year one of the most dynamic periods in the history of interactive entertainment.  With our focus on producing a portfolio of hit games, increasing our shift to digital and building profitability, EA successfully navigated the transition and delivered transformative results.  First, we delivered on our commitment to lead the transition to new consoles with great new games. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have successfully established a new generation of console gaming, and our games are at the top of the charts. We immediately established EA as the early segment share leader on the new consoles, and today we continue to lead.  EA is the number one publisher on the new consoles with 40% segment share in calendar year 2014 across North America and Europe. The depth of our game line-up on the new consoles remains unmatched and was bolstered this quarter by the addition of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare and the huge hit, Titanfall. Second, we delivered on our plan to grow digital, powered by the extraordinary depth of play offered through our live services, mobile games and full game downloads. Our Ultimate Team game modes generated more than $380 million in FY14, including a breakout year for Madden Ultimate Team, which grew 90% year-over-year. In all, our full-year digital non-GAAP revenue of approximately $1.8 billion exceeded our guidance by almost $100 million and represented 45% of our total revenue.  Third, our objective was to increase profitability and keep our costs flat during a transition year. Not only did we do this, we exceeded our own expectations by reducing operating costs and doubling cash flow year-over-year, all while maintaining our investments in key IP. These achievements were the result of strong execution. We began FY14 with an aggressive plan and a slate of incredible games. Through the hard work of the best and brightest teams in the industry, we delivered on our key objectives for the year. Now we turn to FY15, where another exciting year is already underway. At the core of our company, we aim to deliver amazing and fun experiences to our players, but our concept of what makes an amazing game today has changed. The power and diversity of the platforms, innovation through digital content and services and a greater flow of feedback from the player community, means we are designing experiences for long-term entertainment.  Our plans for FY15 reflect this focus. We expect to launch awesome new games for console, PC and mobile, as well as introduce great new content for our existing live services. And now, let\u2019s touch on our new games coming in FY15. Global excitement for this summer\u2019s World Cup is heating up, and we have just launched FIFA World Cup 14. We\u2019ve included all 203 FIFA-sanctioned national teams, as well as 21 stadiums and 11 game modes in the most immersive version of our tournament game, ever. Next up comes the much-anticipated arrival of EA SPORTS UFC, launching on June 17. The power of the EA SPORTS Ignite engine and the new consoles bring to life the athleticism, emotion and intensity of the sport like never before. You truly feel the fight in this game. The addition of Bruce Lee, the father of mixed martial arts, to this game last month has been a huge hit with fans around the world. Over the summer we plan to deliver new editions of our major EA SPORTS franchises, Madden NFL 15, FIFA 15 and NHL 15. Madden NFL 15 will bring the deepest defensive game play in franchise history and a new Madden Ultimate Team that builds on last year\u2019s success. NHL 15 will mark the game\u2019s debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and it is looking fantastic. FIFA 15, the world\u2019s most popular sports game will deliver breakthrough innovation that brings fans closer to the sport than ever before. Fall 2014, we\u2019ll see the arrival of The Sims 4, our first all-new Sims experience in over five years. The team at Maxis has built an innovative technology base, which offers smarter, more relatable Sims with rich emotions; fluid, intuitive creative tools and vibrant and intimate play spaces. These all combine to create the most entertaining, surprising and personal Sims experience yet. In October, BioWare is scheduled to release Dragon Age : Inquisition. Showcasing the vast capabilities of the Frostbite 3 engine, Dragon Age is an epic, character driven story in a visually stunning, living open world. It\u2019s the most immersive RPG ever created in the rich history of Bioware. Two more EA SPORTS titles are scheduled to launch in Q3 and Q4. NBA LIVE 15 returns from our Tiburon studio, where the teams have been working with community feedback to deliver a great game. We will also debut our new EA SPORTS golf game, the first on next-gen and something entirely new from our development teams in Florida. And last but certainly not the least, we also have a major new game coming in our third quarter this year, powered by Frostbite 3 and developed by some of our most talented teams. We\u2019re excited to unveil this game to our fans first, with a live reveal next month at the gaming industry\u2019s marquee event in North America, E3 in Los Angeles. We\u2019re preparing a rich lineup of games for E3 this year that showcases our commitment to the player experience. This will include first looks, demos and other new announcements for many titles from this year\u2019s slate. We also plan to unveil details on at least six new projects in development at EA. Over the next few years, we\u2019ll deliver some epic new entertainment experiences to our players, built on a foundation of creativity and innovation. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing a lot more with our gamers in just a few short weeks. We will launch fewer titles in FY15 as we focus on delivering top-quality games and services and invest in new experiences. Previously, we announced that we will not release an NCAA Football game this year. We also decided not to ship Need for Speed game in FY15. Ghost Games in Gothenburg is working on an innovative new chapter of the storied franchise, and we\u2019ve planned an extended development window to ensure we\u2019re delivering a high-quality experience for Need for Speed players next year. To keep the experience fresh for players in our live services, we expect to deliver more new content through the year than ever before. Three map packs are planned for Titanfall, two more expansion packs for Battlefield 4, and our EA SPORTS games received live daily updates, including Ultimate Team content and much more. Through hours of new game play and additional content, live services make our games truly dynamic entertainment, with rich new experiences for gamers every time they play. Moving on to our mobile portfolio, we are now approaching a $500 million business with more than 130 million monthly active users. Our strongest titles, The Simpsons : Tapped Out, The Sims FreePlay, Real Racing 3 and FIFA 14, clearly demonstrate our approach for EA Mobile : engineered games as live services, designed to constantly evolve and keep players engaged long-term.  EA Mobile studios are preparing some exciting new experiences from our major brands this year, while also incubating and prototyping more new projects for the future. Through all of our plans for FY15, we will maintain our focus on building profitability across EA\u2019s business for this year and beyond. Delivering quality experiences and executing on our plans are critical goals for us in FY15. FY14 was an outstanding performance and an important year for EA and the gaming industry. We are proud to have emerged from a transition year as a clear leader on new consoles and positioned for growth across key platforms and regions. Our focus is now on executing in FY15 against three objectives that define a new EA; delivering amazing games and services to players around the world, driving innovation and creativity into new experiences, and building deeper relationships with our community. Over to you, Blake. Blake Jorgensen :  Thanks Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had an extremely strong quarter and a phenomenal year. Before I get into the details, I\u2019d like to provide you with some context, especially on the quarterly results. As you may remember, during our third quarter ending in December, we came in below our revenue guidance because of its steeper than anticipated decline in PS3 and Xbox 360 software demand, which was partially offset by next generation software sales. We anticipated this was going to continue into the next period, which caused us to lower our FY14 revenue guidance; however, during the March quarter this weakness moderated and we continue to see strong demand for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One software. Additionally, we saw a robust pick up in our digital sales. These factors provided a significant boost to our revenue, gross margins and operating profits as we closed out our year. We are encouraged by both new console hardware and software sales, but we continue to see risks associated with the decline of the previous generation software as the transition to the next generation continues. We are approaching fiscal \u201815 cautiously and we\u2019ve attempted to factor this potential risk into our guidance. But before I walk you through our guidance, let me get into the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. EA\u2019s Q4 non-GAAP net revenue was $914 million, which was $114 million above our guidance and $126 million below last year. The decline over fiscal \u201813 was primarily due to the recognition of over $120 million in Battlefield 3 Premium revenue in last year\u2019s Q4. Relative to our guidance, the upside was driven by greater than anticipated demand for our digital offerings, primarily driven by full game downloads, as well as extra-content, specifically from Madden, FIFA and NHL Hockey Ultimate Teams. Additionally, we saw a strong showing from our console titles, most notably from Titanfall, Madden NFL 25, FIFA 14, Need for Speed Rivals and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare. Madden NFL 25 is a great example of our digital strategy. Due to the deep, immersive game play in Madden, combined with the engagement of Madden Ultimate Team, we exceeded our expectations both in full game revenue, as well as digital extra content. In addition, we have found that the Ultimate Team experience is engaging players in the game, long after the season has ended. EA\u2019s Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $550 million, which exceeded our guidance by $93 million. This resulted in our fiscal full year digital revenue being nearly $1.8 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $243 million, up 8% over the prior year, led by continued growth in Ultimate Team services and FIFA Online 3. As Andrew had mentioned, our Ultimate Team services accounted for more than $380 million of our annual revenue. Second, our mobile business generated $126 million for the quarter, up 21% over prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority of the revenue, accounting for $111 million of the total, and growing 41% year-over-year. Our mobile revenue has continued to set new records for us each year and we are closing out this year with nearly $460 million of mobile revenue. Third, full game downloads added $112 million to the quarter, up 13% over the prior year. This was driven by full game downloads for Battlefield 4 and Titanfall, and strong demand from other catalog titles, both on consoles and PCs. Our Oregon service for PC gamers nearly doubled its monthly player engagement levels over the previous year, and continues to grow in revenue and users. And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $69 million, down $122 million or 64% over the same period last year. This significant decline is a result of how we accounted for Battlefield 3 Premium revenue. Last year, all of the fiscal 13 Battlefield 3 Premium revenue, which was over $120 million, was recognized in Q4. This year we are recording Battlefield 4 Premium subscription revenue on a ratable basis, smoothing out the revenue over the year. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 77.4%, up over last year\u2019s 74.3%. Gross margins also exceeded our guidance of 71% due to the pickup in our digital revenue, especially from direct downloads on consoles and PC downloads on Origin.  The new generation consoles are showing impressive growth in full game downloads. In North America we have seen two to three times greater downloads on the new consoles versus the prior generation. We expect this will continue to fuel growth of this part of our digital business. Operating Expenses for the quarter were $503 million, down $37 million from last year, and $22 million lower than our guidance. This was driven by continued cost discipline and finding further efficiencies around contracted services and marketing efforts. For the full year operating expenses totaled $2.02 billion, which was $131 million below our initial guidance for the year. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.48 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.09 per share and naturally drove higher than anticipated cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $281 million, compared to $233 million in the prior year. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in over a decade at $712 million, and it more than doubled last year\u2019s cash flow of $324 million. Fiscal \u201814 capital expenditures were $97 million, resulting in free cash flow of $615 million, exceeding our upward revised guidance of $500 million. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.37 billion or approximately $7.60 per share.  In addition to the stronger cash flow and operating results, we made a one-time repatriation of $700 million of foreign earnings from certain international subsidiaries. This bolstered our onshore cash balances. At the end of the quarter approximately 68% of our cash and short-term investment balances were held in the U.S. The tax impact of this repatriation was not material. Related to the use of this increased cash balance, we are announcing a new $750 million stock repurchase program. This repurchase program has a 2-year time frame and replaces the remaining $222 million portion of our previous buyback program. In summary, our fiscal year \u201814 was a great year for EA. Despite navigating through a year of tremendous change in the industry, which included a challenging console transition, we were able to exceed revenue guidance, drive higher gross margins, lower our operating expenses, improved non-GAAP operating profit margins to 18%, double operating cash flows and invest in new products and services for the future. On top of all these positive points, we are also implementing a new $750 million buyback program. Throughout fiscal \u201814, we conveyed to you our goal to grow non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20% over a three-year period. As we demonstrated through our results, we are clearly ahead of this goal by at least one year.  Our improving operating leverage is a testament to our commitment to drive higher operating profits for EA\u2019s shareholders and lays the foundation of possibly exceeding it. More important, it positions the company for profitable growth in the future. Now turning to guidance. For fiscal year 2015 we\u2019re forecasting growth of approximately 2% for our non-GAAP revenue. This estimate reflects fewer major launches this year, including new titles and the continued headwinds associated with the console transition. Andrew laid out the new releases, and as he mentioned, we will not be releasing a Need for Speed or a college football game this year. However, we have included in our guidance a major new game that we expect to launch in our third quarter. GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is expected to be $4.38 billion, and we expect GAAP earnings per share of $2.37. Non-GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is expected to be $4.1 billion, and we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 per share. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into the key drivers of our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and distribution revenue was forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down 10%, driven by fewer announced launches, greater shift to digital delivery, and a continued tempered view regarding PS3 and Xbox 360 titles. Digital revenue is forecasted to generate nearly $2.1 billion, up 17%. Breaking down our digital revenue into its four primary categories, we see the contributions from each group, and the sustained growth in each area. Our mobile revenue is expected to grow over 20%, as gamers\u2019 engagement on smartphones and tablets continue to expand at a significant pace. In addition, we plan to expand our entertainment offering across these platforms. Full game downloads are anticipated to continue to show growth based on early trends seen on the new consoles. Additionally, the release of The Sims 4 should also contribute to the growth in this category. Extra-content and free-to-play is expected to continue to grow over 15% this year, fueled by our live services. It becomes more difficult to show significant percentage growth year-over-year, as this revenue base has hit a sizeable level, $0.75 billion dollars. Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 30% this year, as a significant portion of the Battlefield 4 Premium revenue will be recognized during this fiscal year. Based on this segmentation, non-GAAP digital revenue is expected to represent over half of our total revenue, a significant milestone in the digital transformation of our business.  The increased digital revenue should help bolster our gross margins; however, this will be offset by the release of more royalty bearing titles this year, such as UFC, FIFA World Cup 14 and Titanfall catalog sales. Based on all of these factors, we are forecasting the non-GAAP gross margins to grow to 68.5% for the year. GAAP operating expense for the fiscal year is expected to be around $2.17 billion. Non-GAAP operating expense for the fiscal year is expected to be approximately $2 billion, down 1% compared to fiscal \u201814. This will also result in an operating margin of approximately 20% for fiscal \u201915, doubling our operating margin in just two years. Focusing on Q1, GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.2 billion, as compared to $949 million in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.26, as compared to $0.71 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $700 million, a 41% increase over last year\u2019s $495 million. This quarter will benefit from the launches of UFC, FIFA World Cup and Titanfall for Xbox 360. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 67%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $8 million higher compared to last year, taking into account three launches in the quarter versus one title last year. For the quarter we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share as compared to the loss of $0.40 per share last year. Looking at the phasing for the year on a non-GAAP basis, as compared to the prior year, the first and second quarters are expected to represent a slightly larger portion of the revenue due to the timing of our launches. Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal year \u201815, we\u2019re forecasting operating cash flows of approximately $800 million and capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in free cash flow of $700 million versus $615 million in fiscal 2014. We remain focused on improving financial performance and driving profitable growth. To achieve those goals, we will continue to drive the digital transformation of our business and the efficient utilization of all of our assets. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. It was a dynamic year for gaming and an outstanding year for Electronic Arts. Through the transition, I\u2019m proud of what our teams accomplished in FY\u201914, and the position of our business today. We are the number one worldwide publisher on new consoles with great games like Battlefield 4, FIFA 15, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals and Titanfall.  We have a portfolio of hit mobile games and a strong plan for expansion. We have exciting new PC free-to-play opportunities around the world. We are increasing profitability and investing in the future. Our digital products and services continue to grow and will account for more than 50% of our business in FY\u201915. Looking at the opportunities in front of us, I\u2019m even more excited about how EA is lining up for FY15 and the years ahead. At Electronic Arts, we are committed to putting our players first. This starts with creating amazing games and services\u2019 fresh, fun experiences that connect, inspire, challenge and entertain players all over the world. In FY15, we\u2019re planning new games for console and PC, new titles for mobile and new experiences through our live services. Games and services built around fresh IP are a key part of EA\u2019s future. Our teams are working on more exciting projects, including Star Wars, games and development at our DICE and Visceral studios, new titles from Bioware and Criterion, as well as new experiences from our EA Mobile studios. We\u2019re also excited to announce that EA is continuing its partnership with Vince Zampella and the Respawn Entertainment team, building on our success in delivering Titanfall, the biggest interactive entertainment event of the year so far. Through a new publishing agreement, we\u2019ll be working with Respawn to bring new Titanfall experiences to players worldwide. Amazing games and services must be built on a foundation of creativity and innovation, and we are committed to constantly involving not only the games we make, but the way that we make them. Our teams have a track record for driving innovation in games and they are pushing to achieve more. Across our studios today, we have teams rapidly prototyping ideas for compelling new experiences, and using shared technology stacks to quickly develop and test more creative concepts.  We\u2019re also channeling innovation into our design processes, engineering new development and testing frameworks to enable each game we launch to perform at the scale of today\u2019s gaming audience. With every game, every feature, every part of our live services, EA is innovating to pioneer the next generation of game experiences. Finally, we are also committed to continually engaging with our players and taking action, to ensure we are delivering meaningful and positive EA experiences. Our gamers are at the very center of our focus and we\u2019re transforming how we connect, engage and act on their feedback. Across our games and platforms, more than five billion online game sessions played monthly deliver game data that helps us evolve game experiences based on play patents. Millions of conversations about our games are happening on social networks and we are there connecting with these growing communities through dialogue and interactive content. We continue to prioritize and expand our capabilities in support so that help is readily available to our players when needed.  Through these interactions and many others, we are constantly in dialogue with our community, acting on their feedback and building long-lasting relationships between our gamers and EA. Our commitments are clear, our position is strong and new opportunities are in front of us. We have a lot of hard work ahead, and it will be an exciting year for EA. I look forward to seeing many of you at E3 next month, but for now, Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets : Congratulations! That\u2019s a great end to the year. Just a couple of quick questions. As we look to fiscal \u201915 and that $2 billion OpEx number Blake that you just alluded to, can you give us a sense as to how it may break down between kind of our R&D and more specifically what we should expect out of sales and marketing. Blake Jorgensen : I think what you\u2019ll see is a continuation of what you saw this year. So moderation on R&D, trying to hold that flat and slight declines in marketing and sales as we continue along our path to become more efficient and shift towards more point-to-point marketing, social marketing, individual marketing versus Big TV campaign and I think the challenge that we have is we\u2019re going to continue to try to manage down the OpEx where necessary, but balance that against investing in all the great titles we have coming in \u201916 and \u201917 and particularly the Star Wars franchise and some of the new franchises we have coming online. We don\u2019t want to hold that back at all.  But I think we\u2019re at a very good place and we worked hard over the last couple of years to really build a much more efficient structure. Efficient in a way we build games and the way we operate and we\u2019re just now moving into the phase where we\u2019re starting to just manage our business that way and continue to keep an eye on our costs along that fashion. Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, and then just a couple of quick ones; can you give us a sense as to the percentage of games that are being downloaded now, full game downloads of consoles. And then Frank, if you can talk a little bit about what your expecting for the mobile space and kind of what\u2019s been driving that growth going into fiscal \u201915. Andrew Wilson : I\u2019ll let Peter answer the full game download question. Peter Moore : Yes, I mean as Blake said in his prepared statements, we\u2019re seeing two to three times multiplies on what we saw in the previous generation for PlayStation 4 and for Xbox One. Depending on the games, depending on the platform, you can put that anywhere between 12%and 15%. So it\u2019s not yet material, but it\u2019s becoming an important part of our business going forward here. So that as I say is about two to three times the rate that we saw on Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 and we expect that trend to continue and of course its good for the consumer, as well as being good for us from a margin perspective. Frank Gibeau : Ed, this is Frank. Let me give you a quick overview on what we\u2019re doing in mobile. Lets start by looking at how we finish up \u201914. As Blake said, we\u2019re rapidly approaching a $500 million business in mobile. We had a record year. We\u2019ve been in the mobile business for a while, but this was our best year ever.  Across our titles, we\u2019re reaching about 130 million people on a monthly basis and we\u2019re seeing that number continuing to grow. In \u201914 alone we installed over 620 million games on mobile devices, which creates an incredible network of players for us worldwide.  Our four biggest titles; The Simpsons, Sims FreePlay FIFA 14, Real Racing, we\u2019re all reaching revenue and engagement piece long after launch. So we\u2019re definitely seeing a sustainment in terms of these light services that we\u2019re creating. Overall revenues grew about 24%, but more importantly, on smart devices and tablets we grew up over 40%. So while we\u2019re pleased with where we\u2019re at, we know we can do better and we expect that we\u2019re going to continue to do better going forward and it really is about putting the other plan that allows us to execute and get back into the top of the charts. I think we\u2019ve done a good job at the art of game making. Our properties are very high quality, very well reviewed and we have very strong engagement. But we frankly need to get more productivity out of our live services and how we operate these games and that\u2019s been one of our key focuses. Today EA Mobile is a group of frankly very talented development and publishing teams. That group\u2019s sole focus is on mobile platforms and it\u2019s really been about increasing the speed at which we\u2019re developing and responding to the market. We\u2019re really going a lot faster than we have in the past. We\u2019re building big new experiences on our major brands and they are designed from the ground up as premium slide services, and their goal is to evolve over time based on player input and how players are engaging with the services. This is alongside of building a big braded games. New IP is vitally important inside mobile. We created a group of small teams that are rapidly prototyping new concepts and new IPs and new game mechanics for the mobile space and exclusively for the mobile space.  Our PopCap studio is at the forefront of these efforts and just as importantly, we\u2019ve been investing in new go to market capabilities and technologies for our live service teams to deliver the maximum value to our fans.  So ultimately our goal is to build a diverse mobile platform of sustainable long term IPs from our collection of proven brands and innovative new ones. We want to spread them across multiple genres and they will be available in all regions. Speaking of regions, success in Asia is vital for EA in mobile. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building studio and publishing teams in each of these major Asian markets. We now have dedicated mobile teams in Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul, who are all working on culturealized versions of our existing IPs, as well as some new ones. In fact we\u2019re going to be launching our first internally developed new game from EA Tokyo, FIFA World Cup for iOS and Android just next month with the release of World Cup, powered with the hot event of the World Cup event.  So frankly, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the mobile opportunity at EA, which is totally complimentary to our existing console and PC businesses and we have great growth opportunities in front of us for years to come. We\u2019re not going to go deep on what our slate is for the rest of the year for competitive reasons, but as we approach E3, we\u2019ll be telling you more and more as we\u2019re filling out and building out our mobile strategy at EA. Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets : Great, thank you. Andrew Wilson : Next question. Operator : Yes, that comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks. I add my congratulations on the quarter and your continued progress in the goals. I have one clarification on the major new games. Is this from an existing franchise or is this new IP? Andrew Wilson : We will be announcing that at E3 next month. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Okay, fair enough. Andrew Wilson : But we are very, very excited about it. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Good. Secondly, Blake, now that your already poised to hit the 20% margin goal ahead of plan and as you look ahead to fiscal 2016 and beyond that, can you put a new range perhaps on the potential impacts from operating leverage on the model as the cycle progresses? Blake Jorgensen : We set a new world record. So its only 35 minutes after we provided guidance and I\u2019m already being asked for next year. No, we\u2019re not prepared yet. I think we\u2019re very focused on just continuing to execute and really drive great gains and we\u2019ll start to give people over the next six to 12 months, some center view on the longer-term digital strategy for the company. We\u2019re excited that we\u2019re reaching the 50% mark in digital business and what we\u2019re really focused on is how do we get closer to 100%. We believe that there is a huge opportunity and that the business is indeed changing and we\u2019ll start to help people understand what that might look like over time, but right now we\u2019re focused on execution and its really making sure \u201915 is a success and sets us up for a great \u201916. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Okay, well tried. One with Peter then. Peter Moore : Good luck Colin. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: It sounds like with the Madden Online and then Ultimate Team that you\u2019re seeing a lot of progress there. Is the engagement, is the monetization on Madden similar to levels that you\u2019ve been seeing at FIFA already that\u2019s trending in the right direction. Andrew Wilson : I\u2019d say its trending Colin. It\u2019s a different game you\u2019re primarily doing with Madden, a relatively smaller game. 32 teams in the NFL versus the 750 we have in FIFA, but the trends are great. One of the things that we have seen and as you\u2019ve heard from the number, the 90% year-on-year growth is that traditionally we\u2019d look at Madden and we\u2019d look at engagement levels drop off precipitously post the Super Bowl, but reverse has happened here.  Because of Madden and Ultimate Team, because of the great work the team at Tiburon had done by providing fresh content, we\u2019ve seen very low drop off post Super Bowl and it bodes well for us as we have this FIFA now, almost for 12 months a year and a NFL experience as we do a 12 month a year FIFA experience.  So engagement levels are high. The monetization will catch up, but consumers are loving it as they do with FIFA and obviously when we combine all of the Ultimate Team\u2019s that you heard from Blake, $380 million in visual revenue, not only is it meaningful material margin rich, but also the engagement levels that drives is phenomenal for us. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I think to Peter\u2019s point that we\u2019re seeing a similar situation in the NHL business, while its small as well compared to FIFA, the same type of engagement is occurring and we\u2019re very excited about that and trying to make sure we\u2019re taking those learning\u2019s and using those across the portfolio. Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird: Thank you guys. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Colin. Operator : The next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Co. Your line is open. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Co.: Thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about Titanfall a little bit. First, if you could just share how many units you\u2019ve sold to-date, that would be great and then you\u2019ve mentioned the three map packs. I was wondering, you talked about live services a lot. How often are you thinking about ways to keep engagement of that game strong? See what will likely be a multiple year development process or the sequel when you\u2019ve got other big shooters coming to market over the next six to 12 months. Thanks. Peter Moore : Hey Dough, its Peter. So the first question, we said standby for Titanfall and boy! did it land and landed phenomenally well. MTV has us at 925,000 units sold through, which is for the quarter; its unbelievable considering it only arrived on the Xbox One with PC with three weeks to go. I can also tell you that the Xbox 360 version is off to a great start as well.  As regard to the Map Pack, the first one me can be coming later this month called Expedition. We obviously have three planned. On top of that we\u2019re doing the season pass as well, which is keeping the engagement levels there and our goal quite frankly is to keep this franchise as fresh as we do with our Ultimate Team and our sports, as well as we do in the Battlefield obviously with Premium and as Andrew mentioned, we have a new publishing agreement with the very talented folks at Respawn who have done a great job and Vince Zampella and his team need to be congratulated for what they\u2019ve delivered so far. So we\u2019re feeling very good about the digital engagement levels and hopefully we can continue to drive this franchise forward. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Co.: That\u2019s great, thanks. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Dough. Operator : Next is from Justin Post with the Bank of America. Your line is open. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch : Yes hi, this is actually Ryan Gee calling in for Justin. The first question I guess for Blake is, to help us think about the gross margin expansion potential. It looks like with over half of the revenue next year coming from the non-packaged goods side, but gross margin is only expanding maybe a point or so. Is there much left in gross margin for you guys or levers to pull there? Blake Jorgensen : The first part is, the key is we do see the continued gross margin expansion due to digital, but we also have a couple of titles that are now starting to bear royalties in the year, that we didn\u2019t have in previous years. UFC is a royalty bearing title and as Titanfall grows, it will still infer to pay royalties to Respawn for example, as well as the royalties on our regular sports product and so that counter balance is some of the F1 trend and we\u2019ll see continued growth, but we think it moderates.  I think we\u2019ve already said that you know it will move closer to 70% over time, getting above 70% where we currently have the business mix as it is and it won\u2019t be hard longer term possibly as we move to a much higher percentage of digital; we would most likely be able to move it above that, but for now we\u2019re expecting somewhat muted growth in the year, primarily just because of the royalty issue. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then the second question I guess for Peter is, I\u2019m not sure if this is covered in the prepared remarks, on the sports business, could you guys provide an outlook either for franchises or maybe an aggregate on sports growth potential for this year. You guys did that last year and that was really helpful. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : I don\u2019t remember the last year Ryan. We\u2019re obviously very bullish. I think the focus, the next few months is going to be the FIFA World Cup. As you\u2019ve heard in the remarks, we\u2019ve now shipped that in; a lot of anticipation to that title. As soon as the domestic leads finish around the world, the teams then will, the national teams would gather in Brazil and your going to see a great pick up of engagement levels on a global basis with that. With regards to a broader sports portfolio, I\u2019d have to go back and look at what we said last year, breaking it down either by franchise or cumulatively. I\u2019m not too familiar with what we did last year. Blake. Blake Jorgensen : I could probably give you a little help here. So last year and this coming year we\u2019ll see similar trends. We\u2019ll still see some muting in the growth of the core franchises back in the biz and full game business because of the Gen3, Gen4 headwinds. So I would assume that your core franchises are about the same size as they were this year, with a little bit of growth to the digital Ultimate Team. We\u2019ll see some growth we believe in NBA LIVE. We\u2019ll obviously have FIFA World Cup, which adds more than 2.5 million units probably. We\u2019ll have USP in there and we\u2019ll have the golf game that Andrew mentioned. So net-net you\u2019ll see growth of the total sports franchise, but the core\u2019s fifth franchise is probably fairly flat and then remember, NCAA will not be in this year. Its on a huge title, but it will create a small headwind against some of the new growth. Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse : Hi Andrew, so I guess its more of a big picture question, but there is a rising opportunity here to tether your business through user base that you can explicitly manage. Manage as opposed to being forced to tether your business to a hardware-installed base that somebody else manages. So how does that change your game development philosophy or resource management if at all? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : I just want to make sure I\u2019m answering the right question. There is about who we build for with respect to which platforms and eco systems and how that relates to our development contract. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse : That\u2019s right. Andrew Wilson : So, again we think about our world in a few key pieces. The first key piece is around the core platform that actually facilitates the engagement ID, commerce, data, infrastructure, security, game services and certainly what we are doing now is building towards a future that has great ubiquity of devices and great ubiquity of gaming and a platform that will allow us to move without game advice, wherever they might play, at any given time and any given geography or any different business model. The next thing that we\u2019re really starting to think about a lot is how do we build an engine that is scalable from a six-inch screen to a 60-inch screen over time. So again, irrespective of where gamers are engaging with us, they are getting the highest fidelity in entertainment and you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve been able to do with the Frostbite 3 engine and EA Spots Ignite and certainly we\u2019re starting to figure about how we built a scalable mold there and we\u2019re investing against that for the future, so that it can move, irrespective of what size window or portal our gamers are playing through. And then lastly it comes down to our games themselves and understanding that the user base is expanding, the platforms in which they play are expanding and the business models in which they engage with our games is growing and we\u2019re moving from a place where its simply two hour sessions or 20 minute sessions to scalable session times and game designs that can facilitate kind of two minutes to two hours. And so what we end up with in a future of ubiquitous devices, ubiquity of gaming is a platform that goes with the gamer no matter where they are and in them that can deliver the fidelity of experience, irrespective of what size window they are looking at it through and games that are designed to be with them, whether its in a two minute experience or a two hour experience over time and we believe that if we can deliver that and invest against that now, then we\u2019re in a very good position for the future. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray, your line is opened. Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray : Good afternoon. If we look back at the last cycle we saw a few players loose share and some were on a business and we thought EA and a couple of competitors that actually drove share and maybe drive higher industry concentration. Does it feel like there\u2019s still market share growth opportunities or is this a strategy during this next generation to effectively preserve share in the renewed growth phase of the cycle. Peter Moore : Hey Mike, its Peter. I think there\u2019s market share growth, but more importantly there\u2019s market growth and as Andrew just so eloquently outlined, the ability for us to be able to deliver content on all of the new platforms, the ubiquitous broadband that we\u2019re now seeing for connected devices, our ability to be there with the A-games and franchises I think is inherited even more so in this generation that we\u2019ve seen in the last few years. So as we continue geographic and platform expansion, our mobile business continues to grow, so the top of the funnel brings more and more people who want to play games into smartphone and tablet play.  The 32 Play PC browser business continues to grow and we\u2019re seeing quite frankly stabilization in our console business. Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are showing some growth. We\u2019re up 127% in hardware sell through over the five months as compared to where we saw the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in the previous generation. So I think all of the key indicators are pointing backwards. Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray : Okay, and then you mentioned the higher percentage of purchases or full team downloads for next gen to-date. Could that be a function of early adopters being more kind of committed to building a library and owning certain titles permanently in their library and as next gen consoles extend beyond the early adopter crowd, well downloads will be a higher percent of purchases in the last cycle that it might not maintain the same kind of I guess overall share purchases. Peter Moore : It could be. I mean its fairly based. With the first few months in we don\u2019t have a huge portfolio of titles as an industry yet that\u2019s testing this. I think both Sony and Microsoft have made it more convenient for consumers to instantly hit the A button and start downloading.  From the perspective of what we\u2019re seeing, it depends on the genre. I think the early adopters interestingly are as likely to one, a title on the shelf as they are to on that\u2019s in their hard drives, but the technology is there. I think the gamer interest in direct downloads in going to be there and I think we\u2019re going to see continued growth in this area.  Again, full game downloads is even more ubiquitous obviously in the world of PCs and we\u2019re seeing that growth as well. So when we talk about full game downloads, we not only talk about consoles, but also the PC. But I think this percentage is going to grow, absolutely. Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Peter Moore : Thanks Mike. Operator : Next is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is opened. Ben Schachter - Macquarie: Hey guys, congratulations on your recent success. So I recently tried Oculus Rift and it was really just a phenomenal experience. So I\u2019m just wondering, how far off is the Oculus Rift style with the reality from commercial deployment? Is that one year, three years, is it still more than five. And then just quickly, separately on mobile, a couple of your competitors continue to dominate the top 10 grossing charts. So I\u2019m wondering, what it is that they are doing so differently than others? Is it the game quality, the marketing, the network effects and all these kinds of things, are these replicable by folks like yourself? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : So I\u2019ll take the one and I\u2019ll pass to Frank to speak about Mobile. Oculus VR has done an amazing job in the realm of virtual reality and we\u2019re eager to see how their headset evolves over the coming years.  For us, we\u2019re always cognizant of emerging technologies, new opportunities and with any new technology its important for us to ensure that there will be an attractive install base before investing heavily, but they are certainly making strong progress.  Its also important to note that there are new peripherals such as Oculus, run common operating systems and architectures, its implacable for us and you know as we go to more devices and so what we\u2019re doing right now is really monitoring the market place, where as what Oculus is doing, what some of the other devices are doing there and really thinking about that scalable infrastructure architecture I referred to in an earlier question and how we would pivot to a virtual reality, modality of play, if and when that becomes in high demand from our gaming base. Blake Jorgensen : And its right, we talked a little bit about mobile, probably the most fast moving dynamic, high growth sector gaming right now and there isn\u2019t one established formula for how to be successful in that category. Clearly our aspiration and frankly track record is that when we go after a market and go to the top we deliver on that, and that\u2019s going to be our mission in EA Mobile. If you look at what is really setting apart some of the biggest hitters in mobile right now, its how they operate and how they deliver live services around their games. Their games are live, they are social, they are vibrant, they are constantly changing or adding new features. If you look at the top 10 charts, many of the games that have been there have been out for months and months and months, including our own games, The Simpsons. The Simpsons was in the top five. And so we learnt a lot from the symptoms experience that we are brining to bear on the rest of our products. But it\u2019s the mobile market that is dynamic, its fast moving, but at the same time its really all about how you prep the game to launch and how you approach the live services and each of the competitors out there, whether its King or Supercell or Dunhill or Electronics Art, each have different approaches on that, but there\u2019s some fundamental points that are important.  One, is the frequency at which you release content. It\u2019s the quality of the features that you put out, it\u2019s the morality of the game play and the game loops and its frankly how you use your acquisition marketing, your network marketing to build your IPs and frankly to introduce some new IPs along the way.  So I don\u2019t think the book is written for how to be successful in mobile yet. There\u2019s still a lot of experimentation, its very dynamic, and what works in Asia can be very different from what works in the west. So we are excited to get into this category in a much more significantly focused way and that\u2019s our mission, to getting in to the top of the charts. Ben Schachter - Macquarie: Great, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Pitz \u2013 Jefferies: Great thanks. Blake, you may have covered this is the prepared remarks, but just wondering if you could give us a sense for what\u2019s driving the decision to announce the $750 million buyback, any change in philosophy here. And then separately curiously, how your progressing with the Star Wars games and the developments specifically at Battlefront. Do you think that we could hear anything about this title or other Star Wars title at E3? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : I\u2019ll let Andrew address the Start Wars title. But let me just hit on the buyback. I think we\u2019ve at lease in the last few years we\u2018ve been committed to buying back stock. It\u2019s a firm belief of this management team that we need to return cash to shareholders.  The biggest single driver was first driving returns. I think you got to make sure you can keep the horse before the cart so the heck whatever it is and in that case it was we needed to generate better returns and we doubled our cash flow this year and we plan to raise it again next year based on our outlook and we feel very confident that we are moving into a higher cash generation phase of our business.  In doing that, it builds confidence on our ability to be in the market buying back stock all time and that\u2019s our goal; its to just be consistently up there buying and covering our dilution when we issue any new stock internally for employees. I think the other piece of that puzzle which we mentioned in the prepared remarks was that we also repatriated some foreign earnings back to the U.S. at a very advantageous tax rate and that moved our balance of cash on shore tuna that would be greater than off shore, where historically its been the other way around, and that allows us to even fuel the buyback program that much more.  So overall really driven by the operations and we are going to continue to stay focused on that. Andrew, get the Start Wars question. Andrew Wilson : Yes, okay. So the Star Wars battlefront, the best I can say is its coming along very, very well. Frostbite 3 and the associated development tool set that comes with that has met the team has been able to iterate and drive innovation very quickly and get to a high quality quickly and certainly. There\u2019s lots and lots of work to go. But we do plan to show more about and other new projects in development at E3 this year. Operator : : Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company : Hey guys, congratulations on an awesome quarter. I\u2019m not sure if you covered this already, but there is a MediaOracle on potential relationships with Comcast and allowing basically a streaming solution of many of your games directly to the set-top box or the TV. So I\u2019m curious if you could talk about that or maybe not the specifics of the deal. Perhaps how you fell that sort of solutions to be productivity for your guys in the future. Andrew Wilson : So I can\u2019t comment on that specifically at this time. But what I would say based on what I outlined of a future that I believe is coming to us, which is this ability for gamers is to interact with games across multiple devices, through multiple channels, multiple business models throughout the day. You can certainly see that that modality of play might be important to a large populating of gamers, certainly in North American and around the world. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company : Okay, fair enough and then Blake on the, I realize you guys don\u2019t want to talk about the unannounced game. I\u2019m sure we\u2019 ill see it at E3. But guessing its kind of first person obviously, any sense of the wait of this game as it relates to the guidance that you gave for the year and then perhaps under the assumption it is an FDS, the landscape here, you know for the holiday period looks to be pretty thick. Just maybe how you feel that games can differentiate themselves and still find success is that sort of competitive scenario. Blake Jorgensen : Well, we can talk about it being that its not announced, that\u2019s basically what we\u2019ve been saying and that there\u2019s a gain in our forecast. What I would is I would think about it. The hold that we had to fill this year was essentially Battlefield sales from last year, if you don\u2019t have the Battlefield in the year and so you got a hole that you got to fill.  The way we\u2019re filling that hole is essentially new titles along the lines of FIFA World Cup, UFC, the Golf Game, Sims and Dragon Age. I would say that there was about two thirds of the hole. The rest of the hole we would assume was being filed by this new unannounced game.  We are highly conscious of the crowded slate in the back half of the year and what that means is its got to be a great game and its got to do really well, particularly on the new generation, boxes and are going to have to be unique and I think you will see all that E3 when you get a change to see the game. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company : That\u2019s fair enough, that\u2019s very helpful. And then last one on the digital sales, obviously it looks like initially good traction here two, three times what we had on prior gen, but it seems like there\u2019s some levers still really to pull here to drive greater adopting of digital, whether its pre-downloading maybe a loyalty program or pricing flexibility, maybe initially its to change behavior. How do you guys think about maybe being more aggressive or leveraging to pull to drive digital adoption and expand your gross margin? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I mean what you\u2019re going to continue to see and hear from us over the next couple of years, a lot of things around digital. I prefer we don\u2019t hear that much about pricing, because I think that there\u2019s lots of ways that we can create better content, more convenience without having to change our pricing structure.  But I do think what we\u2019ll focus on is how do you deliver the gamer a much more enhanced experience and they can do that with far less friction; meaning, getting in the car or having to order a disk and we believe the market is shifting that way and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on how we can help drive that shift by driving great game play. Operator : Thank you. And that comes from John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corp. Your line is open. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Hey, congrats from me too. I got a couple of question. I don\u2019t know if you said this specifically, but could you give us a sense of the percentage of Titanfall that was delivered digitally as opposed to retail? Peter Moore : Hey, JT its Peter. I can\u2019t break down the individual titles. As I said and as you\u2019ve heard two to three times in the last generation, depending on the platform, depending on the genre, depending on the game, anywhere between 12% and 15% of our total sales at any given moment. It might be full game downloads on those consoles and of course it\u2019s a great percentage on origin, which type of fall is also available for. So all in all a growing part of the business, I can\u2019t break it down right now by individual titles. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Okay, the 12% to 15% is really helpful. And the its been a while since we\u2019ve heard any kind of dissertation shall I say on Origin. Feels like Origin is kind of now built into the tool set that everybody is using to reach customers through e-commerce, maximize revenue per lower user acquisition cost and so on. Are there any metrics you can kind of share from year-on-year kind of improvement or expansion or declines. Is there any way you can kind of characterize how that tool is working in terms of building efficiency into the business? Andrew Wilson : Yes, you talk about engagement and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve doubled our monthly engagement levels year-on-year and we continue to grow. Obviously this year with the Sims 4 year coming up as well, we\u2019re excited about how Origin becomes part of that tool set.  Its important to my organization, so its part of the publishing organization and I think it does a phenomenal job in engaging consumers. It allows us to be able to of course directly, commercially transact with them in the PC space and the more PC content we have the more powerful its going to be for.  As Blake will tell you, it\u2019s a margin enhancing part of our business and particularly when you think of the Sims year coming up as well and of course we\u2019ve had Battlefield and more recently Titanfall. So it continues to grow, we continue to invest in it. Its going to be an incredibly important part of our digital strategy going forward. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Are there any sort of major improvements that you expect to do, say in the next 12 months in Origin or is it \u2026? Andrew Wilson : Yes, I mean we\u2019ll talk a little bit more when I see you at E3 and I can maybe be bring in our team and if you want to do a deeper dive, I\u2019m more that happy to do that. A lot of feature sets, we got a roadman, we are continuing to build the features in there, make it even more user friendly than it is right now. But yes, we can dive into that E3 if you have interest. Blake Jorgensen : A couple of things you saw just during this past year you know, we introduced the great game here and TV for example more recently have done a program called On The House where we\u2019re giving away some of our catalog titles to our really dedicated users. We took part of the Humble Bundle fund raising and had the highest. I think Humble Bundle sold $10 million, yes and some of that is obviously to get people to try Origin or to make sure we\u2019re build a great relationship with our Origin customers and some of its just to make sure people are getting access to our games and every pivot platform that they want to and we\u2019re very encouraged by where its going and we\u2019re trying to keep our heads down and just deliver versus spend too much time talking about stuff. So hopefully you\u2019ll see it in the numbers. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Okay, let me ask Frank one thing if I can and then I\u2019m done. So on the mobile side, Frank could you give us any sense as to how much effort resources wherever are going into new IP creation as opposed to leveraging the brand portfolio this year, given you can do rapid iteration and kind of improve on the flying on that kind of thing. It seems like this ought to be kind of a workshop and in terms of bringing on new IP and expanding the market for EA and getting a little bit away from the portfolio, nothing wrong with the portfolio but new, as good as well. So any way you can talk about any of that. Andrew Wilson : I can talk a little bit about share; its sounds like you\u2019ve been reading my email. We have an I mentioned in my remarks, we carved off a lot of very experienced and high quality teams to go and rapidly prototype and we are taking about multiple prototypes per week and burning through them quickly, getting them into test, both internally with all of our employees as well as externally. So we see that focus on new IP rapid prototyping is absolutely vital to how we are going to succeed in mobile. The big brands are important and it\u2019s a good part of the portfolio, but right along side your going to see new IPs from us that come from this rapid prototyping, rapid testing endeavor that we\u2019re embarking on and we\u2019re pretty excited about it, because we have a vast network of engaged players that we need to get into position to introduce new IPs to them and new games to them. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about it. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Is there any way you can sort of characterize what percentage of your folks or development budget or whatever is sort of working on those things as opposed to leveraging the portfolio. Andrew Wilson : We don\u2019t really announce percentages that way. I would say that its bigger than you think. John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corp.: Okay, thank you. Andrew Wilson : Ally, I think we\u2019ll end it there. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect at this time.",

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Rob. Earlier this afternoon, we released our Q1 earnings report detailing a strong start to fiscal year 2015 for Electronic Arts. At EA, we have a commitment to put our players first, holding at our core that every game, every live service, every EA experience will deliver the entertainment, innovation, creativity and value that our players want.  With a strong slate of exciting new titles and fresh content served to players in our live services, we are well-positioned to deliver on that commitment in FY15. Around the world, more than 300 million registered players are engaging with the long-lasting entertainment provided by EA\u2019s games and services today.  In the last quarter, gamers played more than 13.6 billion online sessions of EA games, for a total of nearly 2.4 billion hours played across console, mobile and PC experiences. To put that in context, that\u2019s more than 3,000 years of gameplay every single day. On screens from six inches to 60 inches, for sessions of two minutes to two hours or more, EA continues to deliver outstanding entertainment to players. Our global FIFA soccer franchise had a standout quarter as the World Cup drama began to unfold on the pitches in Brazil. More than 53 million matches were played in FIFA Ultimate Team World Cup mode alone, during the quarter. That\u2019s the equivalent of more than 830,000 World Cup tournaments. The World Cup update to FIFA 14 on mobile drove engagement to a franchise record high, and in Korea, FIFA Online 3 had the highest peak concurrent player levels ever for FIFA Online since it was launched in 2006. Fight fans drove sales of EA SPORTS UFC to exceed our expectations for the quarter, and the in-game action has been intense : more than 65 million fights have been played since the game launched. With EA SPORTS UFC joining our other great games for the new consoles, EA continues to hold the #1 segment share on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One calendar year to date. Our live services and digital content are reshaping the gaming experience today, helping players enjoy the games they love for longer. During the quarter, \u201cNaval Strike,\u201d the third expansion pack for Battlefield 4 launched to players in April, while Titanfall\u2019s first content pack \u201cExpedition\u201d was released to players in May. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes continue to feed players\u2019 insatiable appetites for their favorite sports, with live updates, new content and competitions daily. Players also continue to get new and fresh experiences in live services for our top EA Mobile games, where we drew more than 140 million monthly active players in Q1. Titles like The Simpsons : Tapped Out, Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and FIFA 14 demonstrate the success in the approach of our mobile development teams \u2013 build top-quality experiences around fun and entertaining IP that can grow over years of play. With innovative new content like the Real Racing 3 Le Mans update, which drew 2 million entrants, players keep coming back to their favorite games. All of these factors contributed to a strong fiscal first quarter for EA as we delivered revenue and EPS above our non-GAAP guidance. Our focus is now on the work ahead of us for FY15 as we prepare to launch a slate of new games and live services to our players. As I said at the top, our commitment to players and the quality of our games is paramount with every game we make. We have some amazing new experiences coming this year \u2013 games that will connect, inspire, challenge and entertain players. Games that are packed with creativity, innovation and emotion. Games with vibrant communities giving us feedback to make them even better. Dragon Age : Inquisition is the biggest RPG that BioWare has ever created in its rich history. It will deliver an epic open-world experience, powered by Frostbite 3 and combining combat, compelling characters and rich storytelling.  The game was a huge hit with fans and critics at E3, taking home 25 awards, including Best RPG from the E3 Game Critics. The team has crafted an absolutely amazing game for players. They want this to be the best Dragon Age experience ever delivered, so they are taking a little more time to put the final touches on the game. Dragon Age : Inquisition now launches on November 18.  The live multiplayer beta for Battlefield Hardline that launched at E3 was a powerful opportunity to bring our players into the game earlier than ever before. With 1.7 million players joining the beta on PS4 and PC and logging more than 4.2 million session hours over two weeks, the beta delivered a very stable experience that also helped the Visceral Games team gather valuable player feedback. Additional player testing has shown great excitement for this new world of cops and criminals inside the Battlefield franchise. It also showed us how, with more time, we could go deeper and innovate more. Visceral is testing and implementing several new features that will help to make Battlefield Hardline a game that players can enjoy for many years to come. We are moving the release of Battlefield Hardline out to Q4 FY15, and the team will be keeping players regularly updated on progress. We\u2019ll also have an all-new beta opportunity in the months ahead for players to experience more of Battlefield Hardline. Of course, Battlefield fans don\u2019t need to wait until then, as Battlefield 4 continues to provide a dynamic live service today. Many more hours of new Battlefield 4 content and gameplay are yet to come, including the expansion packs \u201cDragon\u2019s Teeth,\u201d launching worldwide on July 29, and \u201cFinal Stand\u201d coming in Q3. The DICE team continues to deliver new updates and features for Battlefield 4 players, and recently introduced a Community Test Environment for players to provide feedback on new additions to the game before they launch. With breakthrough gameplay innovation, stunning visuals, and immersive depth and detail, this year\u2019s EA SPORTS lineup will capture an unprecedented level of excitement and emotion. Madden NFL 15, FIFA 15 and NBA LIVE 15 are all making big strides in the second year of the new console generation, while the NHL and PGA TOUR franchises will make their next gen debuts this year. NHL 15 took home Best Sports Game from the E3 Game Critics, and EA SPORTS PGA TOUR takes golf to places it has never been as the first sports game to be powered by Frostbite 3. Maxis will launch The Sims 4 in early September to an eager fan base ready to get their hands on this rich new Sims experience. Everything about The Sims 4 is exciting, from the massive technical innovation that gives these new Sims emotions and unique personalities, to the beautiful and vibrant new neighborhoods in which they live, to the weird and fun stories that players will tell. For both veteran fans and newcomers alike, The Sims 4 will open up a whole new world of gameplay possibilities. Players can pre-load The Sims 4 on Origin and be the first to play. We will deliver entertaining new experiences from some of EA\u2019s biggest brands to players on mobile devices. New FIFA and Madden NFL experiences are set to launch during Q2, as well as a big and really fun new update for The Simpsons : Tapped Out. A much-anticipated new Peggle game from PopCap is moving through a test period in preparation for launch, and our EA Mobile studios have four more exciting new experiences from other major franchises in development. We\u2019re excited to share more about all of these new titles for iOS and Android players in the coming months. EA enters our second quarter in a strong position. We are committed to delivering top-quality games and services to our players throughout the year. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q1 financial performance and FY15 outlook. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. Starting with our Q1 results, EA\u2019s non-GAAP net revenue was $775 million, which was 57% higher than prior year\u2019s results and 11% above our guidance. Digital continues to be a major contributor, but this quarter also saw three new launches \u2013 EA Sports UFC, FIFA World Cup 2014, and the Xbox 360 version of Titanfall. In addition, FIFA 2014, Battlefield 4, Madden NFL25, and the rest of our catalog titles had solid performances.  : Extra content and free-to-play contributed $211 million, up 19% over the prior year, led by sustained momentum and approaching 90% growth in our Ultimate Team business. We saw NHL Ultimate Team grow 50%, FIFA Ultimate Team grow nearly 80% and Madden Ultimate Team grow over 350% year-over-year. Star Wars : The Old Republic and FIFA Online 3 also continue to be significant contributors. As a reminder, this revenue relates to businesses on PC or consoles, where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content. Mobile generated $120 million for the quarter, up 18% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority of the revenue, accounting for $109 million, or 90% of our total mobile revenue. Going into a little more detail, we break out our mobile revenues into two streams : first, digital extra content and advertising revenues, which is also known as freemium; and second, full game or one-time download revenues, also known as premium. In the quarter, $105 million or 87% of our mobile revenues were comprised of digital extra content and advertising revenue, reflecting the shift to the freemium business model. This freemium business was up 39% versus the prior year, more than offsetting the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was $15 million, down 43% compared to the prior year. We attribute our freemium growth to the strength of our portfolio of live service games. We continue to view mobile as a business with tremendous opportunity as the market is experiencing significant global growth in smartphones and tablets. And as this market base expands, we continue to release new content in our live service games and execute against our launch roadmap. Full game PC and console downloads represented $71 million, up nearly 90% over the prior year. Historically, full game downloads were primarily driven by PC-centric products. However, we continue to see full game download growth on the new consoles. Titanfall, Battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 were key PC and console titles that contributed to the increase in full game downloads in addition to other catalog titles. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $80 million, up 31% over the same period last year. The ratable recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium is a key contributor to the increase in our subscription revenue this quarter. : Operating expenses for the quarter were $459 million, $18 million below prior year and $26 million lower than our guidance. Our lower operating expenses are due to continued cost discipline, but some portion of the reduction is due to quarterly phasing of key expenses in marketing and contracted services and we expect these costs to be incurred in future quarters. The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.19 per share, exceeding our guidance and prior year due to strong revenues, higher gross margin, and lower operating expenses. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.32 billion, or approximately $7.40 per share. Roughly 68% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $4 million, versus last year\u2019s use of $248 million for operating activities. Year-over-year this is a $252 million improvement in cash flows. On a trailing twelve month basis, operating cash flow hit a company record high of $964 million demonstrating our ability to generate higher cash flows. During Q1, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $50 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May and has a 2 year time frame. Before we discuss guidance, we want to address a couple of items.  First, we recently completed a review of our portfolio of licenses and agreements and we decided not to use on a going-forward basis certain licensed intellectual property. This decision resulted in a GAAP-only charge of $122 million to cost of goods sold due to the loss on the corresponding royalty commitment. Going forward, our non-GAAP P&L will benefit from this decision not to use the IP. It should also be noted that this decision will not impact any of our core licensed products. Second, with regard to our share count, for the first time since the issuance of our convertible notes in 2011, our average stock price for the quarter was above the $31.74 exercise price of the notes. However, at the time of the issuance of the notes, EA also entered into bond hedge and warrant transactions to effectively raise the exercise price to $41.14.  Under GAAP, we are required to include only the dilutive effect of the convertible notes and warrants in determining our diluted share count. However, on a non-GAAP basis, we also include the effect of the offsetting bond hedge transactions in order to provide a complete view of the economic dilution to earnings. On our website, we have posted a table that illustrates the potential share count dilution on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Turning to Q2 guidance : GAAP net revenue is expected to be $965 million, as compared to $695 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be ($0.12), as compared to ($0.89) loss per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP net revenue for the quarter is expected to be $1.14 billion, a 10% increase over last year\u2019s $1.04 billion. This quarter, we will launch The Sims 4, which we expect to more than offset last year\u2019s college football game. In addition, we will launch FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15. Non\u2013GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 65.5%, better than prior year\u2019s 62%, driven by the positive impact of The Sims 4, a PC-centric, wholly owned IP. Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some operating expenses from Q1. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $530 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 per share, as compared to $0.33 last year. For fiscal year 2015, we are reiterating our non-GAAP guidance announced at the beginning of the year \u2013 net revenue of $4.10 billion and $1.85 of fully diluted EPS. We expect our positive Q1 results to offset any impact of delaying Battlefield Hardline to the fourth quarter.  The GAAP guidance is $4.30 billion in revenue, and $1.78 of fully diluted EPS. The updated GAAP estimate reflects the impact of the $122 million GAAP charge I mentioned, as well as the delayed launch of Battlefield Hardline. Regarding cash flow for the fiscal year, we continue to forecast operating cash flows of approximately $800 million, and capital expenses of approximately $100 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $700 million. We remain very positive about the trends in our industry and business \u2013 growth of the new generation consoles, trends toward a greater digital business and growth in mobile and PC free-to-play. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. We have an exciting year ahead of us. We raised the curtain at E3 on rich new experiences in development at EA today, providing a view into our future and the breadth of games and services from favorite brands and new IP.  Now we head to Gamescom in Cologne, an event that is all about giving millions of gamers worldwide the next view into our games coming this year. For more than 300,000 gamers attending in Cologne, it will also be an opportunity to get up close with our biggest titles including, FIFA 15, The Sims 4, Dragon Age : Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline. We look forward to hearing more of their passionate feedback. We greatly value that open interaction and dialogue with our players. It is what drives us to lead with innovation, to explore new ideas, and pursue creative new experiences with every one of our games. The opportunity in front of us is to build entertainment on a truly epic scale \u2013 to captivate with amazing experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play. There\u2019s a lot more to come from Electronic Arts in FY15, and I look forward to sharing more updates in the months ahead. For now, Blake, Patrick, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird : Firstly, on the Battlefield and Dragon Age news, certainly sounds like the extra time is justified. I wonder if that should also change our assumptions at all about release of next year\u2019s sequels, such as Battlefield. And then secondly, what are you guys seeing in terms of the mix between physical and digital sales on next-gen, particularly full game downloads. And as a related point, how are you managing the transition to digital with your retail partners in mind? Blake Jorgensen :  First, we\u2019re going to refrain from giving \u201916 guidance already, or even talking about timing on Battlefield for next year. We\u2019re committed to continuing to build a great Battlefield franchise. I think that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re really focused on a fabulous hardline product. And you\u2019ll hear more as the year goes on, about what might occur in the future year. I would say, though, that since we\u2019ll be shipping in fourth quarter, you\u2019ll tend to see more hardline business next year than we would have originally had if we\u2019d shipped it in the third quarter, and that bodes well for our \u201916 as well as our \u201915. With that, let me turn it to Peter. Peter Moore : As Frank mentioned in his remarks, we saw about $71 million in full game downloads, which excludes mobile. And that was split about 50-50 PC versus console. And I had mentioned on the last call that we were seeing somewhere in excess of 10% now for full game downloads on the Xbox Live and Playstation network. We\u2019re seeing that continue to grow. Now it\u2019s between 10% and 15% of the initial sales that is going digitally full game downloads on those platforms. And if we take UFC as an example, which only shipped with two weeks of the quarter left, we saw at the high range of that 10% to 15% band. So we\u2019re continuing to see a progressive move toward gamers being able to download, because they can now on the next-gen consoles, full games on day one and week one of the ship. I will also add that the transition, though, is working well with our retail partners. Progressive retailers such as GameStop are preselling well our sports titles that are the ultimate edition SKUs, which give $40 of digital content for only an incremental $10. So our retail partners are able to play in that digital space as well, so I think we\u2019re balancing out this transformation between physical packaged goods and digital well, and our retailers are able to play in that space. Operator : Next question is from Edward Williams with BMO Capital. Edward Williams - BMO Capital : First of all, can you talk a little bit about what your thought is on the next-gen adoption trends, what we\u2019re seeing with regards to hardware pickup, and what its impact is on the legacy console systems, and what we might see in terms of a mix between the two as we progress through the year. Peter Moore : :  We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on the current gen of Xbox 360 and PS3, but as we continue to ship games, and as our competitors and colleagues in the industry continue to ship games, we\u2019re seeing still a pretty vibrant ecosystem there, and we have reassurances from both Sony and Microsoft they\u2019re going to support the long tail of both of these platforms. So very, very strong start for Xbox One and Playstation 4, respectively. Edward Williams - BMO Capital : And then can you just comment a little bit now that you\u2019re eight months into post-release of these consoles, what you\u2019re seeing with regards to developing the software for those systems? Any challenges that you\u2019ve run into? Or has the learning curve already been mostly scaled at this point? Andrew Wilson : Great question. I think what we\u2019re seeing right now is, you know, any time you go into a new platform transition, you know, the benefit, to use that term loosely, of going through three or four major transitions in my career so far, they are never easy. What you do find as you come into the second phase is that the software, the operating software of the platform itself, starts to stabilize. And the first parties, Microsoft and Sony, start to find additional processing and GPU bandwidth on those platforms that we\u2019re able to benefit from. Also, our teams get a better understanding of how our engine\u2019s pipelines work with respect to those new platforms, and we start to see an optimization of our development process, and we start to see greater output in terms of CPU, GPU, and ultimate quality of games as a result. Operator : The next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company: I want to touch on the mobile gaming business. It feels like we\u2019re kind of rapidly morphing to a situation where the hits in that business are getting bigger much more rapidly, but potentially beginning to suck some of the air out of the room for lesser titles, much like we saw happen in the console space over the last five to ten years. Just curious if you agree with that, and also, if and how are you changing your approach to the mobile business to try and ensure that you get some of those top 10 and top 20 hits that could really be material eventually. Frank Gibeau : Let me point out that you are correct in that there is a greater concentration of revenue in the top of the charts in mobile. So the dynamic that we\u2019ve seen in the PC or the consoles over the years is happening in mobile, it\u2019s happening at a fairly normal rate, if not any faster or any slower than what we anticipated. But you\u2019re definitely seeing more revenue, more audience in the top five, top 10, top 20. It is a very large market, and the charges do differ by region, so Asia is very different than the west. So there\u2019s still a lot of room to maneuver in terms of the types of titles and the types of genres that can be successful and that are growing. The mobile business also has a lot of growth in front of it, and so we anticipate that the overall pie will continue to grow while the concentration occurs at the same time. So it\u2019s a lot of positives in terms of how you look at the overall market. When we look at our opportunity in mobile, EA, we\u2019ve really looked at what are we really good at and what do we need to get better at? And what we think we really have as a core competitive advantage is an unbelievable portfolio of IPs and brands.  If you look at some of the more recent releases in mobile, like Farmville or even the Kim Kardashian game, it\u2019s really pointing to the fact that brands are becoming more and more important in mobile, and if you look at the charts, the concentration of the revenue is happening in brands. That\u2019s definitely moving into our direction, where we have a strong portfolio of proven brands like the Sims, FIFA, Madden, Need for Speed, and so on, as well as The Simpsons Real Racing. So we feel really good about how the market\u2019s moving in our direction on the IP front. We also have great production values. We\u2019ve got great technology. So we know we can nail the art side of the business. What we need to do a better job of is mastering the live services piece, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time reconfiguring the mobile teams at Electronic Arts from premium to freemium teams. As you heard in the remarks from Blake, the mobile premium side is growing at about 39% to 40% year over year, which is a healthy number. We think we can do even better than that, but what\u2019s important to us is that we\u2019ve been going through this transition from premium to freemium, and it\u2019s pretty much over at this point.  It\u2019s freemium from this way forward, and we\u2019re adding a lot of new technology and talent to allow us to operate freemium services at scale. So the combination of proven brands that install organically at an amazing rate, combined with great freemium services that engage customers over a very long time and provide them great value. So we feel really good about that combination of audience, brands, and freemium services. Operator : The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : First, maybe just give us a little more color on the Battlefield beta. Obviously you\u2019re pushing it out. What areas maybe are you trying to address and make better? And then secondly, great job with the expense controls. Are you kind of through that? And kind of more level expense growth from here, with revenues? Or how are you thinking about that and making sure you\u2019re investing in the future? Patrick Soderlund : We launched the beta at E3, and we saw a tremendous pickup of players. We had over 1.7 million players in the beta. And what made me happy was the fact that we had a stable environment, people got to play the game, and it functioned really well, which is kind of the first thing we\u2019re looking at when we look at a beta. Then, we allowed people to play for a little bit longer, maybe, than we planned, because we found a lot of feedback from players in there, providing us valid information and feedback around features of the game and how the game felt, etc.  And things like the cops and robbers fiction maybe wasn\u2019t shining through properly, you know? Is it playing like a military game, but it should be a cops and robbers game? We saw ideas around asymmetric gameplay, a bunch of really strong, good, well-thought ideas that we decided to listen to. And having a long discussion with the team, and looking at where we were, we felt like the best thing for us was to give the development team a little bit of extra time and get the game to where we think it needs to be in order to be successful. Blake Jorgensen : And let me address the opex question. You know, I think we\u2019re never done reviewing our opex and looking for opportunities to bring opex down. The question is, do we use that savings to invest back in the business, or do we drop it to the bottom line. I think we\u2019re pleased with the level that we\u2019re currently running at, but we also know that we\u2019ve got future products that we need to invest in, as well as marketing that we want to invest in. If you look at the trend from \u201913 to \u201914, just for Q2 as an example, Q2 opex in \u201913 was $580 million, and it dropped to $499 million in last year\u2019s trend. We\u2019ve guided obviously above that, but most of that guidance is driven by marketing spend increases to support The Sims, which was not obviously in last year, and a very profitable product for us, as well as some of our continuing fueling the mobile growth and our Ultimate team and sports property growth. But the reality is, we\u2019ll probably continue to keep focused on that. The key message, I think, for shareholders is the organization is very aligned on making sure we manage opex effectively and balance that against investment for the future. And we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re seeing, and the level that we\u2019ve been able to maintain. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse :   I think I just heard Blake talk about $105 million in net mobile revenue that we\u2019re not advertising, I guess from freemium content. So I guess this suggests about $150 million in gross bookings for the quarter, and about $600 million for the year. So this makes you already one of the larger mobile game companies on the planet, yet it seems like you\u2019re monetizing on a paying user basis at about half the rate of some of your developer peers. So is there yet a concerted effort inside the company to bring up the monetization rate at all? Or will your preference be to try to grow your active user base for now? Additionally, you\u2019re disclosing that you have 140 monthly active users as of the latest quarter. What was that number a year ago? Blake Jorgensen : Just a clarification. We had $109 million of mobile revenue associated with smartphones and tablets, and of the freemium revenue, which is most of that, that was primarily the $105 million number I mentioned. So freemium is $105 million of the $120 million overall mobile. I\u2019d be careful about drawing a line between that number and our ability or inability to monetize. It\u2019s hard to assess that based on just a pure revenue number. Now, having said that, I\u2019ll let Frank address, we are obviously focusing on how we can monetize more, and build great games around that. Frank Gibeau : Yeah, the key to monetization is value and engagement, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on, is building live services for our products that deliver the maximum value to customers over the long term in a highly engaged way. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll start to see our conversion percentages improve, our [darbs], all the KPIs that go into what monetization looks like. That\u2019s where our focus is right now. We\u2019re building great games with great brands.  We organically install very well. Last year, we had about 635 million installs across the business. So we generate very large audiences. We don\u2019t have a problem with audience size. Our issue really is engaging them and giving the maximum value over the longest period possible. And what we\u2019re doing right now is investing in technology and teams and talent to get us into position to be among the best in the world at freemium long services. That\u2019s our long term goal. Operator : The next question comes from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee :   I wanted to see if I could focus a little bit on the FIFA franchise. I know you guys talked a little bit about the momentum you had. The World Cup product was only on the old gen, and I\u2019m just wondering how that resulted in the performance of this title versus the one four years ago. And also, if you could shed some light on FIFA 15 preorder activity at this point? Peter Moore : I think it\u2019s a radically different world today, with the World Cup in Brazil, than it was in 2010 in South Africa. When we look at our FIFA franchise, and the offerings we have on a global basis across the platforms that we bring in on the different business models, and our ability to be able to engage our consumer globally versus where we were in 2010, which was simply put out an event-based game, our FIFA Ultimate Team Mode, as Andrew mentioned in our World Cup modal alone drove over 53 million games. We had 800,000 World Cups played almost every single day.  The engagement levels we\u2019re now seeing at a digital level are far greater than we\u2019re seeing from a standalone event-based game. Not to say that that game didn\u2019t do well, and it did, but what we\u2019re seeing now is our FIFA consumer, regardless of the event, is engaged 365 days a year. And really, it was the World Cup mode on FIFA Ultimate Team, combined with great catalog sales of FIFA 14, as well as the event game itself, that will give us tremendous emphasis and motivation to go into FIFA 15 now. And to your question, the preorders are very, very strong on that title. I think it showed extremely well at E3 and we continue to release assets. It\u2019s a gorgeous looking title, and you saw earlier this week the release of the emotion-based engine that the team is working on now. I think it\u2019s a very different world, and it\u2019s a very, very strong part of our franchise offerings. And obviously now I think we\u2019ve moved away from having individual [unintelligible], like big events, and having a 365 day a year offering called football. And it\u2019s as simple as that. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee : On digital, up 28% in the quarter. Guidance for the year is, I think 17%. And just maybe help us reconcile, is there any timing issue here? Or are you just being conservative in [unintelligible] number? Blake Jorgensen :  Well, you know, we always tend to drift toward the conservative side. I think you also, though, have some areas that are fairly consistent quarter over quarter, like extra content. But full game downloads will bounce around depending on the product. PC-centric product like a Battlefield or a Sims tend to do really well on full game downloads, and we\u2019ll tend to see higher quarters then. And while mobile is growing very well, we still want to continue to see that grow, and so I\u2019d say we\u2019re still in line with our guidance, and unless we start to see complete outside trends around something like full game downloads, we\u2019re probably not going to start changing that yet. But more to come. Operator : The next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray : How do you feel the new hardline timing sets a game up competitively compared to the prior October launch timing that, I guess, was arguably a more crowded competitive launch period? And then secondly, this is way out there, but regarding Star Wars Battlefront, I\u2019ll try to avoid asking about specific timing of the game, but maybe more relative to the movie. If the timing of the movie changes, is that something that could impact the timing of the game? Or is the timing of Battlefront not tied to the theatrical release of the film in any way? Peter Moore : It\u2019s a great question on Battlefield hardline, and as I think we all know on this call, we\u2019re coming into a very competitive holiday period. Notwithstanding Patrick\u2019s comments, which are the real reason we\u2019ve moved it, just to create a better game based on the feedback we got from the beta coming out of E3, and of course another beta to come as well. We actually like the window that Q4 offers us. It\u2019s a cleaner window.  We look at Q4 fiscal, which is Q1 calendar 2015, and when you take the primary reason, which is to have a better game, and then you think about the ability for us to deliver in a cleaner window, it actually sets us up well, not only for the quarter but also take in mind how that will set us up for FY16 coming off what should be a very strong game that gives us a longer tail with strong catalog.  I\u2019ll throw it to Patrick to talk about Star Wars. Patrick Soderlund : As it relates to Star Wars, we\u2019ve shown parts from the game today, so you know that what we\u2019re building is more rooted in the traditional Star Wars universe and not so much necessarily linked to the movies being made. And that\u2019s just because we wanted to make a game that celebrated the history of Star Wars. Obviously there will be things in there that are somewhat tied to the new movie. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a particular tie to the movie. Now, obviously we would prefer to be close to the movie, but I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re directly tied to it. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company : Just a quick one on Battlefield, how are you thinking about annualizing this franchise? Basically, what are the metrics that you\u2019ll drive to go green light this franchise as an annual release? And then separately, can you give us some color on the $122 million loss on licensed IP commitment? Specifically, is this Star Wars Knights of the Republic or maybe College Football IP? Or is it something else? Patrick Soderlund : I\u2019ll start with the Battlefield question. For Battlefield I think it\u2019s important that we have the right products at the right time. We need to make sure that we continue to drive innovation, and we continue to drive quality and that we get the best possible games in the hands of our gamers. Now, does that mean that we need to ship a Battlefield game every year? In some years, that may be the case. In others, it may not be the case. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we want or need a Battlefield game every year. I think this year we\u2019ve shown that we are willing to put quality first, and I think that\u2019s ultimately how we are going to be successful. Blake Jorgensen : On the GAAP writeoff, I think the thing about it is when Andrew became CEO, we looked at a lot of things about the business that we had questions on, and one of them was a review of all of our licensed properties that we have. And as you can imagine, we\u2019ve been in the business a long time. We have a long stable of licensed properties, much the same way a movie studio might have with options on properties that they may or may not make movies on. We then went through and decided which properties made sense to maintain and we decided that this property did not. It is not a property that you would, neither of the ones you mentioned, Star Wars or NCAA\u2026 And it\u2019s a property that most people wouldn\u2019t even know that we actually have a license on. But when we decide to abandon a certain licensed property, accounting rules require us to recognize the loss from the decision, much like a loss is recognized maybe when you exit a lease on a facility, for example. And so that charge reflects the loss we will no longer use as part of that IP. Operator : The next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel: I want to stick on the gross margin topic. 70% in the first quarter feels like a milestone for the company. In taking into consideration the writeoff you just mentioned, Blake, have you reset expectations for gross margin? Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin longer term? And then separately, can you comment on - and I think there was a comment made on the FIFA presales - can you comment on presales for sports titles generally relative to what we were seeing last year at this time? Blake Jorgensen : I\u2019ll start with the gross margin and then I\u2019ll turn it to Peter on the presales. So, remember the charge we\u2019ve discussed is a GAAP only charge, and you\u2019ll see in our guidance that we\u2019ve made some changes to our GAAP guidance, but not to our non-GAAP guidance.  So in our GAAP guidance, you\u2019d see a reduction - and this is in the GAAP to non-GAAP tables on our website - you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a reduction of gross profit or a constant revenue of $122 million. And that impacts our GAAP only results, and not our non-GAAP results. On the non-GAAP basis, we\u2019re pretty confident of our continued growth in digital business, which will continue to drive our gross margins. You saw that in the quarter, and you\u2019ll continue to see that as the year goes through. Obviously, as a reminder, Q2 tends to be a lower gross margin time, because of all the sports titles that we ship in the quarter and the royalties associated with those. But we\u2019re fairly confident, as we\u2019ve reiterated our longer term full year guidance to stay the same on a non-GAAP basis. And we\u2019re very focused on driving value and continuing to drive our digital business, which we think will impact our gross margin over time. Peter Moore : So on your question on presales on sports titles, as I mentioned, coming out of E3 we saw a strong pickup across the board for all EA sports titles. But maybe I can take this opportunity to reset some expectations of the importance of presales as a key indicator to the strength of a title. Here at EA we not only track presales, and yes they\u2019re important and have been for decades, but also look on a daily if not hourly basis at the NPS, the net promoter score, what gamers are thinking about our title at any given time. The [unintelligible] awareness, the definite purchase intake, the rating amongst aware. We\u2019re in a digital age now, and again, as important as presales are, and particularly through our key retailers, we\u2019re also looking at the importance of the sentiment that gamers have about what they\u2019re seeing every single day through social media and the assets that we\u2019re pushing out from our games team. So yes, they\u2019re important, yes, they continue to improve, but they\u2019re just one single data point in a myriad of data points we now use to measure our success going into launches. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Ben Schachter - Macquarie : I wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions on mobile that were asked earlier in the call, maybe from a little bit different angle. It seems clear that you\u2019ve had a lot of success with the Ultimate Team so far, and I was wondering if you could talk about how you can translate this success to drive more growth for the sports titles on mobile specifically? Frank Gibeau : Yeah, the teams that are working on Ultimate Team on console and on PC are the same teams that are building the mobile products. And so there\u2019s a lot of crossover and institutional learning that\u2019s going into the designs on mobile. In Q2, you will see two new designs from us on FIFA and Madden that will incorporate a lot of learnings that we\u2019ve accrued over the last several years as we\u2019ve grown the Ultimate Team business in both Madden and in FIFA. Again, it really comes down to what I pointed out earlier, which is engaging the customer, giving them maximum value over maximum time, and that\u2019s something that the console teams on FIFA have done so well over the years, and they\u2019re bringing that to bear on mobile starting in Q2. Blake Jorgensen : I guess the one thing to remember, though, is that mobile games tend to be played in shorter bursts of time, and they\u2019re typically played with one finger or two fingers. And different twitch mechanic then, on a console. And so we develop mobile games associated with things like FIFA or Madden that will take different forms than our current games or our current Ultimate Team franchise. But we\u2019re in full alignment with where you\u2019re heading, which is we think there\u2019s a great opportunity to continue to expand on the fantastic sports partnerships we have with people like NBA, NHL, NFL, and FIFA to really drive mobile around the globe, particularly around the globe in places like Asia, where mobile games are so popular. Operator : The next question is from James Hardiman with Longbow Research. James Hardiman - Longbow Research : Can you talk a little bit about retailers, both digital and physical, that are willing to pay a little bit more for exclusive content? I think GameStop recently said that they were going to at least look into putting a little bit more capital to work. It\u2019s not a completely new trend, but I guess at the end of the day, is that another lever that you can pull that will allow you to extract more of the economics of a game, and how do you balance that with consumer preferences.  And I guess sort of a related question, as Sony moves further and further ahead of Microsoft with respect to the next gen, remind us how long the Xbox One exclusivity is for Titanfall. And is it safe to say that a sequel will be on both platforms? Peter Moore : It\u2019s a great question. Let me also point you to clarification that Paul Raines of GameStop had with this paying for exclusive content. He clarified that the next day. This wasn\u2019t going into developers and publishers and giving them money to get content specifically for a GameStop. GameStop is a very progressive retailer. We work very closely with them around the world in providing them and other retailers with content that drives presales - to my original point - but also drives interest in the game itself.  And again, I think that\u2019s just one thing that drives demand generation combined obviously with great marketing and a great game itself. We see this ability to be able to spur demand six months, nine months, 12 months out, through digital content and offerings. And I\u2019ll point you to my original comments on the Ultimate Team SKU for sports with $40 worth of content for an extra $10 on top of the standard SKU is just one tactic in this battle. Our job is to get the attention of gamers, provide them with great value for the money, and work with our partners, both physical packaged goods retailers as well as digital retailers to be able to drive that business. And I think we do that pretty well. Andrew Wilson : With respect to the relationship with Microsoft, we\u2019re not at liberty to discuss the terms of our exclusivity deal there in the construct of Titanfall. And we\u2019re not in a position to announce anything further, other than we continue to support Titanfall. The player base continues to grow, and as I talked about in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve just dropped some fantastic content for that product, and it had a great showing at E3, where it was on our floor. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company : Just curious on the first person shooter category. One of your competitors has moved to a three-year development cycle with annual iterations of their shooter. And of course the attempt there is, I think, to raise the bar on quality. So I\u2019m curious how that sort of reshapes your thinking, theoretically, on Battlefield, perhaps, where maybe there\u2019s the idea that you\u2019d annualize that. Patrick Soderlund : The first thing we have to do is get to a spectacular engine, and I think engine for us, in Frostbite, is key. That allows us to iterate and improve our workflows and pipelines so that our teams can work as effectively as possible in our engine environment. So we have a large team working continuously on improving and updating our engine.  The second thing we need is teams. We need a bunch of really great development people that can get together and make spectacular games. And then the final thing we need is obviously time. If you look at that as it relates to Battlefield and our shooter segment in particular, Battlefield obviously historically has been made in Stockholm by the [Dice] team. For the reason that you outlined, we did put [Visceral] on it, who is here in San Francisco, and working on hardlines. Now, since Battlefield 4, we\u2019ve had some people in Sweden working on expansion packs, but other people are obviously doing other things. So I think what they\u2019re doing mimics to some extent how we\u2019re thinking. Obviously, more time, if managed correctly, yields a better product. So I would say that we\u2019re similarly aligned, and that we\u2019re taking a similar approach, but we haven\u2019t articulated exactly what teams are working, because that would imply announcing things that we can\u2019t right now. Peter Moore : One thing I would just add there, and to Patrick\u2019s point, the balance of those three things, a great engine, the right teams, and the appropriate amount of time, would actually - and Patrick and his teams have been working for some time on changing the construct. And that doesn\u2019t mean that you have hundreds of people working for longer periods of time. It really means that you have the right sized team at any particular point in time and development, operating at a very, very efficient optimized development environment, so that those at their appropriate size can deliver great creativity and innovation. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company : Blake, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a headcount update for a while. What\u2019s the total headcount for the company? And then if you could segment that between R&D and marketing, that would be great. And then how do you expect that to trend through your fiscal year end. Blake Jorgensen : We don\u2019t disclose very often headcount. We haven\u2019t recently, and we don\u2019t break it out by groups. I would say you should trust the headcount is down from what it has been historically, and we think it\u2019s around the right size now. And we want to continue to move it around based on where the biggest opportunities are, so you might see headcount build up in one studio and down a little in another studio. : Operator : The final question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham & Company. Sean McGowan - Needham & Company: A couple of follow ups. Regarding the two titles that were pushed out a bit, is any of the impact that you\u2019ve seen on your guidance for the fiscal year related to Dragon Age, or is that pretty much going to contribute whatever it would have contributed? Blake Jorgensen : We haven\u2019t changed the guidance. The only thing that changed in guidance was the GAAP guidance, and that\u2019s because we recognized revenue over time based on the life of the game. So in moving Dragon Age and Battlefield forward, we\u2019ll recognize less GAAP revenue in the year, just because the deferral period gets shifted forward. But from a non-GAAP standpoint, we\u2019ve kept our guidance the same. So you should assume that we\u2019re assuming similar revenue for both products. Sean McGowan - Needham & Company : And then a clarification on that $122 million GAAP charge. Is that entirely royalty commitments? And doesn\u2019t that imply a rather large amount of revenue that would have been associated with that? Was that over a very long period of time? It seems like a title that would have generated that kind of royalty payment would be something we would notice Blake Jorgensen : : With that, we\u2019ll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone.",

We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated. Now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. I am pleased to report excellent results for EA's second quarter of fiscal year 2015 exceeding guidance for non-GAAP revenue and earnings and generating record Q2 operating cash flow. Strong new titles, deep player engagement in our large services, and ongoing digital growth drove continued momentum for EA. Putting players first is our top priority at EA and that begins with delivering incredible experiences for gamers every day. Our players on console and PC logged more than 1.9 billion hours of gameplay through the quarter. We also reached more mobile gamers this quarter, with an average of over 155 million monthly active users for EA mobile games. Across the biggest platforms and most popular genres, EA is delivering long-lasting fun and enduring value for our players. During the second quarter, EA launched a slate of new games and services across console, PC, and mobile. To call out a few highlights, Madden NFL 15 kicked off in August and quickly registered as one of the most successful Madden titles in recent years among players and critics. To date, players have logged more than 89 million games of Madden, up 48% year over year. With Sims 4 and NHL 15 launched in September, we have already delivered major content updates to players in both of these games with new features and game modes. FIFA 15 had only one week in our Q2, but within that week it surpassed 3.4 million unique players in one day, a launch record for our FIFA games, and it continues to be strong. On average, we are seeing nearly 50% more players engaged online in FIFA 15 over FIFA 14 last year. With engagement this strong this early, we are very excited about the opportunity we have with FIFA 15 through the soccer season and beyond. The Ultimate Team modes for Madden NFL 15, NHL 15, and FIFA 15 continue to see explosive growth. Our aggregate Ultimate Team player base has already increased by more than 40% over FY14. Madden NFL mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team for mobile also launched for iOS and Android this quarter. Along with our EA SPORTS King of the Course golf game, these are new experiences that have ignited the sports category on mobile. Our EA SPORTS mobile games averaged over 40 million monthly active users in Q2, up 250% year over year. Our digital transformation strategy continues to drive EA as we innovate and provide more ways to play our industry-leading portfolio of games and IP. Last quarter, we launched EA Access, our new digital service for Xbox One players that allows unlimited play across a selection of EA titles and other valuable benefits for a monthly or annual fee. EA Access membership has grown well beyond our early expectations and we anticipate continued momentum in the months ahead. Digital is driving our growth in Asia as well. FIFA Online 3 revenue grew 89% year over year in Q2. In Korea, one of the most competitive free-to-play markets in the world, FIFA Online 3 was one of the top mid-session games by revenue in Q2, and the bidder in China has already reached the top 10 for mid-session games as well. Korea and China are exciting growth opportunities for EA and we continue to explore new ways to reach more players with our biggest IP. Across EA's portfolio, our second quarter results demonstrated the value we can deliver across different experiences, platforms, and geographies. Our slate of new titles and services for this year and beyond will continue to emphasize new experiences that allow players to spend more time immersed in their favorite games. Looking ahead into Q3 and the holiday season, NBA Live 15 launched today with stunning visuals and new gameplay experience, and excitement is building for the release of Dragon Age : Inquisition in November. With more than 150 hours of gameplay, Dragon Age : Inquisition is shaping up to be a true BioWare epic. We believe the additional time that we gave the development team has paid off with a great game that is immense, polished, and fun to play. Both IGN and GameSpot have Dragon Age : Inquisition as one of the most anticipated games coming this quarter and we are excited to have fans experience the deep story and gameplay when it launches in just a few weeks. We expect momentum from Q2 to continue across our portfolio as more players join in our top titles across console, PC, and mobile. Live services for our EA SPORTS games will continue to deliver new updates, content and challenges to players, connecting the real-world events of the NFL, NHL, soccer and NBA season directly to the player experience in our games. We also expect continuing engagement in The Sims 4 as players in the game receive two more rich content updates before the end of the calendar year. On mobile devices, EA will launch two new games in Q3, SimCity BuildIt and Peggle Blast. Both games are free to play and took advantage of EA's new sandbox program where our employees from around the world play-test early versions of titles still in development. The data and feedback we collect from the sandbox helps us bring innovative, high-quality, new mobile experiences to our players. Battlefield 4 will release its fifth expansion pack, Final Stand, during Q3, adding to the massive experience in that game. Battlefield 4 continues to add new players and engage existing fans a year after launch. As a result of the extended services and content updates that we provide, it's clear that players want to experience the games we are delivering for longer periods of time. Looking into next year, we will ensure that our players have enough time between releases to fully explore the depth and innovation in our shooter titles. Beginning on March 17, 2015, in North America and a few days later in Europe, we will launch Battlefield Hardline, packed with innovation and set in an entirely new environment that will excite fans of Battlefield and new players as well. Following this launch, our next Battlefield experience is planned for launch in Q3 FY17. We want to give Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players more time to enjoy these games and immerse themselves in a game, the live service, and the community. Next holiday, we will launch a new blockbuster, Star Wars Battlefront, from our DICE Studio is slated to release in EA's third quarter FY '16. We will detail more of our upcoming title plans in the quarters ahead, as it is shaping up to be an exciting year. For now, I will hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q2 financial performance. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.22 billion, which was 17% higher than the prior year's results and 7% above our guidance. The excellent performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden 15, and The Sims 4. In addition to these key titles, catalog titles, including FIFA 14, Battlefield 4 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, continued to perform well. On a trailing 12 month non-GAAP basis, we delivered record net revenue, record earnings and record operating cash flow. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased by 30% year over year to $453 million, 37% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12 month digital net revenue was another record, up 14% to $2 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free to play contributed $153 million, up 20% over the prior year, led by sustained momentum in our FIFA, Madden and Hockey Ultimate Team services, which were up 96% year on year. Over the same period, we have grown FIFA Ultimate Team 61%, Madden Ultimate Team 277%, and Hockey Ultimate Team 113%. In addition, we saw great success in Asia with the continued growth of FIFA Online 3, up 89% year on year. Star Wars : The Old Republic also contributed to the free-to-play segment. As a reminder, FIFA online is still in beta in China with our partner, Tencent; thus, we are not yet recognizing revenue. The financial success of our digital business follows directly from the strategy Andrew discussed in his remarks of building live services to engage players. These live services are also increasing the longevity of our games. The strength of Ultimate Team in Q2 was mainly due to catalog titles and Ultimate Team revenue associated with the new releases of FIFA, Madden, and NHL is expected to start contributing meaningfully in Q3. Mobile generated $115 million for the quarter, up 11% over the prior year. $105 million, or 91%, of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 35% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $10 million, down 62% compared to the prior year. Full game PC and console downloads generated $94 million, up 71% over the prior year. Although the percentage varied considerably by title, platform, and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $91 million, up 47% over the same period last year. The ratable recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium continues to be a driver behind the year-on-year comparison. EA Access is performing above expectations, although little revenue was recognized in Q2, following its launch in the middle of the quarter. Moving on to gross margins, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 66.1%, an increase from last year's 61.7% and better than our guidance of 65.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to growth in our digital business, both full game downloads and extra content, and by The Sims 4 launch. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $497 million, $2 million below prior year and $33 million better than our guidance. Our lower operating expenses compared to guidance were largely driven by quarterly phasing of key expenses in marketing and contracted services, combined with continued cost discipline. We expect some of these marketing and services costs to be incurred in future quarters. With regard to the year-over-year comparison, bear in mind that The Sims 4 drove more marketing expenses than the titles in the same quarter last year. In addition, some marketing expenses originally planned for Battlefield Hardline were shifted into Q4 as we refine our launch plans for that title. More generally with regard to expenses, we believe there are still many opportunities to improve our profitability. We are focused on generating operating profits, as well as revenues, and this has increased our emphasis on driving our digital and live services businesses. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.73 per share, far exceeding our guidance and prior year, due to strong revenues, higher gross margin, and continued cost control. The beat was primarily driven by the strength of our key franchises, outperformance in our digital business, and the power of our deep catalog, coupled with continued spending discipline. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.39 billion or approximately $7.65 per share. 67% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $183 million versus last year's use of $6 million. On a trailing 12 month basis, operating cash flow was a record $1.15 billion. During Q2, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a cost of $95 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May and has a two-year timeframe. The current rate of purchases keep us on a track to complete the full $750 million in that time. Now turning to guidance, due to our strong first half of the year performance, we are increasing our full-year guidance. For fiscal-year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $75 million to $4.175 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will increase by $0.20 to $2.05 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of approximately 21%. This increase in our total-year guidance is driven by the continued strength of our core titles, our catalog business, our digital live services and our continued focus on operating expenses. In addition, this guidance reflects our plan to ship Battlefield Hardline during the third week of March 2015. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.375 billion in revenue and $2.06 in fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $850 million. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $750 million. Guidance for our third quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.275 billion, a 19% decrease compared to last year's $1.57 billion. Last year's third quarter was exceptional in that it saw the launch of PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and six major next-gen titles from EA. Launches this quarter include Dragon Age : Inquisition, NBA Live 15 and on mobile, Peggle Blast and SimCity BuildIt. Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 70.5%. Q3 operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some of our operating expenses from Q2. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expense to be $515 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90 per share, as compared to $1.26 last year. Our Q3 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.1 billion, as compared to $808 million in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.41, as compared to $1 loss per share in the prior year. As a follow-up to Andrew's comments on our title slate in FY '16 and FY17, we are planning to release Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 FY '16 and our next Battlefield title in Q3 FY17. This provides us with a major first-person shooter title each year and allows us to focus on still increasing earnings progression in the coming years. This also allows our Battlefield titles to enjoy the long life we have seen historically through our core gameplay and extended services. We will provide detailed yearly guidance on our title slate, as we normally do, during our fourth-quarter earnings call, but we felt that more clarity around our plans for Battlefield and Star Wars franchises would be useful at this time. In the last two years, we have achieved major improvements in the Company's operating model, dramatically increasing cash generation and profitability. We're building a solid foundation for steady earnings growth as we focus on player engagement, our continued digital transformation, intelligent investment in new IP and the leverage of our catalog in an increasingly digital and mobile world. We\u2019re very excited about the future of the industry and of Electronic Arts. Now I will turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. Looking ahead, there are three distinct principles that drive our strategy today. As I said at the outset, we are constantly focused on our commitment to put our players first. The foundation of this commitment is delivering amazing and innovative new experiences for our players both from fan-favorite brands and new IP. Battlefield Hardline will be a fresh new direction in the Battlefield universe coming in Q4. We\u2019re excited to deliver Star Wars Battlefront to fans next year, and in recent months, we have shown new projects in development from studios across EA. We continue to invest deeply in new experiences, both near term and long term. Second, as we accelerate towards our digital future, we are transforming the way people play games. For the past several years, we have been developing EA's digital platform, the technology foundation that allows us to deliver live services for games like FIFA and Battlefield while building player relationships that can last for years, instead of days or weeks. That same foundation also enables new player-centric ways to discover and try new experiences, including EA Access and Origin's Great Game Guarantee, Game Time and On the House programs. The digital transformation is unlocking new potential in platforms, content models, and modalities of play, and with our investments in technology and services, we feel well prepared to continue delivering new opportunities for our players. Third, the pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is faster, more focused, and constantly evolving. We are changing how we develop, engaging with players through alphas, betas and other programs to seek out more feedback. We\u2019re changing the shape and skill set of our workforce, and combine the art of game making with the science of managing dynamic live services. We continue to increase our speed, while improving discipline in our operations. As an organization, we are learning, adapting, and evolving to not only be an innovative leader in gaming, but also to build meaningful long term relationships with our players. After a dynamic and rewarding first year as CEO, I'm even more energized for the future of Electronic Arts and this great industry. Now Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. Please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Go ahead, your line is open. Edward Williams \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Just quickly if you guys could dive in a little bit on the digital adoption, Blake, you made the comment that there was a wide range in performance from game to game. But if you can give us a little bit more color as to how it is looking in the various games compared to prior cycles and if there is any key nuances from market to market? Blake Jorgensen : I think clearly we are seeing more of it here in the US than internationally, just because, I think, of bandwidth speeds and the adoption of digital downloads, music and movies and others. We've tended to lead that. The interesting note is remember we had a fairly large SimCity game last year, and then The Sims game this year and so you're still seeing growth even though you had two PC titles back to back in those quarters. So you\u2019ve got to assume that there is stronger movement on the console titles across the board. We are seeing that on both platforms, Xbox and Sony, and we are seeing it across all genres of the games we\u2019re having not just our most current games, but also some of our older games that are in the catalog. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Nick on for Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. With FIFA online still in beta testing in China with Tencent, is there any update on the timeline for when that actually goes live? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : We will probably see \u2013 it really depends on both the performance in beta and timing from \u2013 coming from Tencent, but it's most likely late in Q3 or early Q4, but results in the beta as Andrew mentioned, have been very, very exciting for us. It looks like a strong product and clearly that product has done extremely well in Korea and we hope to replicate a similar view in China. I do think, as we\u2019ve said in the past, it's probably six to 12 months before we really see momentum there and we have a long term view. The game of soccer in China is growing in popularity and we think that means real strength for the long run in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open. Mike Olson \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Without giving anything away like competitively, can you provide some details on what the extra development time for Battlefield Hardline will result in or what kinds of things you guys are focusing on there? Then secondly, you had a strong growth for full game downloads in the quarter. Can you give us a general sense for what you expect the percentage of full game units that will be downloads versus packaged goods over the next several quarters will be? Andrew Wilson : I will take the first part of the question, then pass to Peter to get the digital download piece. At a macro level, what we discovered as we went through the beta phases with Battlefield Hardline and play testing feedback and the various game shows that we showed it at was that the cops and criminals fantasy that was the foundation for the game resonated very, very strongly with not just existing fans, but new players to the Battlefield franchise. But the feedback was also somewhat universal that we should go deeper with that fantasy and really deliver against that to a greater degree, and what we have done is given the development team that time to go back in and really look at how to truly deliver on that cops and criminals kind of gameplay as it exists in a Battlefield world. Peter Moore : The second part of your question as Blake said, it varies from genre to geography, but right now with the increased adoption of Gen-4, we\u2019re seeing anywhere between 10% and 15% of our net sales through digital channels full game download and as we get into the holiday and beyond, we can only imagine that is going to increase. So we're pretty optimistic that that number will increase over the next few quarters as per your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Ryan Gee \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : This is Ryan Gee calling in for Justin. My question is on your R&D investments, encouraging to see that it continues to trend lower, curious to think if there is any point in this cycle where it should start to reverse and you start to actually reinvest in R&D. Then as a follow-up, what percent of your R&D or your development budgets right now are going towards new IP to leverage the new consoles versus existing franchises? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : I guess the most important thing to remember about R&D is that we are changing and reprioritizing all the time the things that we do. And so if you see movements up or down in R&D, that may mean that we've changed the priority in the development schedule, not that we are actually cutting back true R&D spending. We may have ended the cycle of development on one product and are waiting to start on the next cycle on another product. Be careful to let anyone quarter's movement of R&D up or down worry you about new IP development or get you locked into a lower R&D long term. I think in general what we\u2019re trying to do is develop great IP that has live services connected to it, which extends the life of the gameplay, and that may mean over time that our R&D as a percentage of revenue comes down, but that's really driven by the fact that the revenue per product is going up dramatically over time as we're extending the life of those products. We are going to continue to prioritize the R&D across both our console products and our mobile products and our PC products, and you will see R&D spending slowly climb up in a dollar level over time, but most likely as a percentage of revenue continue to stay flat to come down. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Crum of Stifel. Go ahead, your line is open. Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Blake, as far as the revenue guidance is concerned, you beat the quarter by $80 million. You raised by $75 million. I see the $15 million FX detriment you are forecasting for the balance of the year. Are there any other puts or takes you can point to reconcile the updated revenue guidance you provided? Then as a follow-up, I noted a slowdown in mobile. It looked like it dropped sequentially. Is that just timing and do you still expect to grow mobile 20% or better in 2015? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : So I guess conservatism isn't a fair answer there, Drew. I think most important is the fact that we are going to ship Hardline the third week of March. That leaves Hardline as really just the first sell in into the channel in the US and in international markets. We probably will get no replenishment that late in the year and a lot of the digital components of Hardline will fall into the coming year. So we are not overly aggressive, because of that decision, around the timetable. The second is \u2013 while we\u2019re very optimistic about our business, we're also trying to be very conservative in our forecasting and maintain our vigilance around driving the digital side of our business. Today, it's still hard to forecast all of the digital trends and thus we are I think, defaulting towards the numbers that you are seeing. But we\u2019re very excited about both the third quarter slate and the fourth quarter slate and I think the reality is that we will tend to see longer service drawn out across products which will spread revenues out across the quarters unlike having it all grouped in the third quarter as we saw historically. What was the second part of your question, Drew? Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : The second question was concerning mobile. I think you originally guided to 20% or better growth in fiscal 2015 and it looked like it slowed down sequentially. It actually declined from the first quarter and your second quarter. Just wonder if you're still confident you can grow mobile 20% or better this year. Blake Jorgensen : I will let Frank answer it around the product, just one quick math item. Just remember that the premium side of our business, the paid downloads which are really a leftover from our original mobile business, they are still a drag on the overall growth. That drag has now gotten down to a fairly small number, but it dropped 62%. It's down to $10 million. When you look at mobile without that drag, it's up 35%. Now quarter-over-quarter or sequential quarters, you got to be careful because we have products that ebb and flow in every quarter, but let me let Frank address some of the products and, most importantly, some of the new products we are seeing in mobile. Frank Gibeau : Yes, I think Blake said it very well there that the premium services side of the business, which is where the future is and where we are focused, is growing 35% in that quarter and in that year. It was largely tied to a timing issue. The products for sports came later in the quarter, and as you know freemium games don't have big pops initially like a packaged goods game. They tend to grow very nicely over time. If you look the individual products, we saw some very good results year over year on FIFA and on Madden. Overall, you saw in the case of EA SPORTS a jump of over 250% in terms of the engagement metrics. So if you look at a year-over-year comp between titles, you are seeing a lot more effectiveness in terms of the services that we are running, much better focus on value and engagement for our customers, and as you look at the way that the rest of the SKU plan and title plan will unfold over the next period of time. We\u2019re very confident that those growth numbers will be possible. We\u2019re very focused on that growth, but we want it to be oriented towards value and sustainability. So we\u2019re always looking at engagement as the primary metric there to make sure that the products and services that we are building really hit customer expectations and create services that can endure for multiple years like we have with The Simpsons and Sims FreePlay and Real Racing. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Go ahead, your line is open. Mike Hickey \u2013 The Benchmark Company : Just curious if you could talk a little bit to how you see the key drivers or what the key drivers for growth in fiscal 2016? Andrew Wilson : I think that we have a tremendous new slate of titles that we are launching. We talk about Star Wars Battlefront as well as the rest of our sports portfolio that continues to grow. We have got the ongoing growth in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One console generation. We expect that will continue to be very healthy, Need for Speed will be back in a year with having had a full two-year development cycle the first time in its history. We expect that we will be able to continue to scale the live services and the ongoing engagement that we drive for our players. So when you think about that at an IP level, at a platform level with console and mobile growth, and our live service growth, we feel like we have some strong levers to work with for FY '16. Blake Jorgensen : I guess I would add to that the continued growth of FIFA Online 3 in Korea, China and FIFA around the world in general and mobile FIFA Ultimate Team, which has rolled out, as Frank mentioned, continue to contribute to the growth of the FIFA franchise, which we see as very important for us. Mike Hickey \u2013 The Benchmark Company : Then just as a follow-up, can you speak to the future of your Titanfall franchise? Andrew Wilson : We have announced that we have a continuing relationship for Titanfall, but we\u2019ve nothing more to announce at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim O'Shea of Jefferies. Go ahead, your line is open. Tim O'Shea \u2013 Jefferies: Just looking at that Star Wars license, I was wondering if you could articulate the strategy with respect to how many different AAA franchises we might expect to see over the life of that license. In addition to the Battlefront shooter, are you working on any other games in different genres? Any chance we could see something like an RPG, maybe even a reboot of BioWare's Knights Of The Old Republic? And then I had a quick follow-up. Andrew Wilson : Again it's a great IP, a fantastic relationship and we certainly have plans to do a number of different things as part of that relationship that are going to deliver great ways to interact with that IP for players. At this time, we have announced Star Wars Battlefront, that is our focus and nothing more to announce at this time. Blake Jorgensen : If you go back to the original announcement when we struck the deal with Disney, it's clearly a multi-year franchise. Disney is looking for us to help support the broad effort of bringing back the Star Wars franchise, and it's across mobile, social, tablets, online, consoles, across all venues. So you can imagine that we're going to look for many ways to leverage the franchise and help that franchise grow over time. Tim O'Shea \u2013 Jefferies: Then just quickly, any color on that big jump in engagement for Madden? The 89 million games to-date, up 48% year over year. How big of a role does Ultimate Team play in terms of driving that engagement? It sounds like Ultimate Team is really working for you guys. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes, there are really two vectors created that jump in engagement. This year the team embarked on a journey to create a better onboarding flow for the game in general and get more people into the game and enjoying it than we have done before and then from that point of enjoyment, provide Ultimate Team as a way to engage and socially connect with their friends around the sport they love. And the combination of better onboarding and heightened social interaction are probably the two greatest drivers of increased engagement in Madden this year. Blake Jorgensen : We saw this year for the first time that Madden, which normally stops gameplay after the Super Bowl \u2013 we rarely sell a lot of Madden after the Super Bowl and we can see on the servers that people aren't playing much. This year we saw Madden play, primarily due to Ultimate Team, all the way up until we shipped the new Madden. We saw big spikes around the draft in May and we continued to see gameplay even through the summer, as people were engaging with beauty of the Ultimate Team concept and the ability to engage with their friends as a way of continuing to stretch out that engagement. Peter Moore : Just on that point, this is Peter, to Blake's point exactly, Ultimate Team for years has stretched out our engagement with FIFA all the way through to the next installment of the game. We haven't had that luxury with Madden, but in the last year and certainly our expectations for this year do exactly that. Post-Super Bowl, the numbers of engagement were superb and our retail partners were reporting strong catalog sales as a result of that. So we really feel now our NFL game feels like a 12 month a year service rather than a one-off game that is played three or four months a year. Frank Gibeau : Just to add on, mobile Ultimate Team is really serving as the centerpiece for FIFA and Madden there and has driven the year-over-year gains in engagement and audience size. So, Ultimate Team works across multiple platforms and geos and has proven to be a great engine of growth for us. Blake Jorgensen : And if you love defense you could play defense a lot better now than you could before on Madden. Operator : Our next question comes from James Hardiman of Longbow Research. Go ahead, your line is open. James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research : Maybe just give us a little bit more details, if you can, on EA Access. Do you think that having a positive impact on your annual sports titles? Are there any people that may have bought a title, but didn't after the demo period \u2013 any chance that gets picked up by Sony platforms or are those negotiations ongoing? And then I had a quick follow-up. Peter Moore : That's exactly what is happening. We\u2019re seeing both empirical and anecdotal data that people now who are members of Access and of course, have access to games like FIFA and Madden, who've said that ordinarily they wouldn't have gone out and bought them, are now experiencing them and enjoying them and our belief is the next time around when the games are launched, they will actually buy them. It's turning into an incredible sampling program for us if you will, and obviously the value for money is there. As regards the Sony question, nothing to talk about right now on that, but I will say that EA Access is surpassing all of our internal expectations with regard to subscriber numbers and it's delivering exactly what we thought which would be a great way for gamers to get great value and experience more games. James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research : Peter, you talked about that digital mix on consoles of 10% to 15%. Just help me clarify. The last couple quarters, you had talked about similar numbers on the next-gen consoles. Is that 10% to 15% across consoles, in which case it seems like a pretty big increase? Is it just on next gen, in which case it seems like it is flattish despite some commentary that suggested that it might be growing? Peter Moore : That's purely next gen. I'm referring purely to next gen what I talk about 10% to 15% and we are seeing that number grow. As Blake said in the outset, it varies by genre and it also varies by geography, depending on quite frankly, the quality of your Internet speed in downloading multi-gigabyte files. But we\u2019re seeing each quarter that goes by as we ship more games, we\u2019re seeing a steady increase in digital full game downloads. Blake Jorgensen : I guess I would be careful with the number and trying to get a trend out of it. One, since it is just very new and, two, there is not that many titles out there. For us, we ship a lot of FIFA into Europe. If people are doing less full game downloads in Europe either because FIFA is a big title that a lot of retailers use to bring traffic into their stores or because Internet speeds are slow, be careful that you don't use that as a data point that implies that it's either flattened or not. We think the trend based on what we hear from consumers, as well as what we\u2019re seeing in our own product is continued direction toward full game download. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Doshi of CRT Capital. Go ahead, your line is open. Robert Goodman \u2013 CRT Capital : This is actually Robert on the call for Neil, just a couple questions. On Hardline, wondering just beyond what you are addressing with the game, what progress you\u2019re seeing on the development team and when we might be able to expect the second beta there? Then also, if you could provide a little more color on some of the expenses that shifted out of 2Q and should go into 3Q both in terms of the scale and the specific investment areas. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : With respect to the game, again, as I talked about earlier, a lot of what was happening was taking what was a really solid foundation for a game and really doing our best to deliver on the fantasy that was the cops and criminals gameplay mechanic. The team is going through in both single player and multi-player and done a lot to enhance that and make sure that comes to the forefront and delivers an experience that is interesting both to Battlefield fans and new players alike. With respect to the team themselves; they have a great deal of passion around this. There is a lot of great people on that team and I'm energized every time I spend time with them and hear them talk about what they're doing and then see how they are delivering that at a gameplay level. Blake Jorgensen : As far as expenses, what we have said is that some of the expenses associated with either product marketing or contracted services and as a reminder, we often use contracted services late in the development cycle for testing or debugging of a product \u2013 some of those expenses got pulled forward as we moved Battlefield Hardline forward and some of the marketing expenses got phased as well. Also, some phasing around the holidays as we want to make sure we're having great promotions around the holiday timeframe. Then obviously some of it got put into our raise of guidance as a real savings to the quarter and we will try to be as transparent as possible going forward on what we think is phasing and what we don't and that's really the core pieces of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Creutz of Cowen. Go ahead, your line is open. Doug Creutz \u2013 Cowen: I was wondering if you could give a little color of people who are playing your Ultimate Team games on mobile, how many of them are also console players? Then I guess vice versa, how many of your console players are playing Ultimate Team on mobile? Is there more opportunities there to try to cross sell people who are in one experience to get them to also be in the other experience? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Doug, I thought you were going to ask about Madden. Let me let Frank answer the mobile question. Frank Gibeau : It's something that we are tracking and watching. It's a little early right now honestly to give you a definitive answer because the game on mobile is out and it's so new. What we've found to date is that there is a very loyal following that will play Ultimate Team everywhere, but a lot of the mobile activity is incremental to what we have already established on consoles and on PCs, which is great news. So, it's something that we will track over time and report back on, but early stages are that most of it is incremental. Andrew Wilson : And for a little bit more color there, part of our core strategy is to offer our biggest IP as unified and united experiences across platforms where people can play on one platform or many, but interact with a single community across the globe on those platforms. We believe that kind of social interaction and that engagement is the way forward for our industry. Peter Moore : I'm reminded there is also the FUT web app, as we call it, which is a companion app that allows you to be able to manage your FIFA Ultimate Team via mobile, separate to the mobile game itself. But no matter where you are, 24 hours a day, you can manage that FIFA Ultimate Team mobiley. Blake Jorgensen : I think one interesting thing we have watched as we roll out mobile in Korea alongside of FIFA Online 3; it has actually grown both businesses. It just increases the understanding of the Ultimate Team mechanic and the game itself, and we are doing our best, as Andrew mentioned, around onboarding to educate people about the excitement of Ultimate Team. There is still a lot of people that don't understand it. They understand Fantasy Football. They understand playing or trading card mechanics, but they haven't seen how it works in a game, and so we are trying to do a better job of that onboarding, and we feel that across all platforms will help grow all platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Krejcik of Eilers Research. Go ahead, your line is open. Adam Krejcik \u2013 Eilers Research : First one is, have you guys disclose what percentage of your total non-GAAP revenues now come from Asia and where do you see this going in the next year or two? And then the second question is on mobile. It looks like your MAUs have been trending higher I think from 130 million, 140 million, now 155 million this most current quarter, but the smartphone and tablet revenues have been pretty stagnant or flat here. So are you actually seeing lower paying engagement in ARPU levels or is there something else going on? Additionally, how do you think about the CPI environment on mobile? It tends to be increasing quite a bit here. How do you guys view the mobile install landscape? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : I will start with the Asia question and then I will let Frank to address the mobile questions. On Asia, we don't break out our revenues. It is obviously the smallest part of our international business. Europe is obviously very strong, primarily due to the strength of the console business there. Asia as far as console markets, really is \u2013 and Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia are really where the bulk of the console players is and Japan where the biggest markets, China and Korea, tend to be more PC, free to play and mobile. Our strength there has been partnering with third parties \u2013 Nexon in the case of Korea for FIFA Online 3 and Tencent in China. So we\u2019re in early days there, but we see a huge opportunity, particularly to play off of some of our strong IP, not just FIFA, but games like Need for Speed. Our Plants vs. Zombies franchise is very popular in China and you'll see us focusing on both mobile and free-to-play games in those marketplaces through partnerships or through iOS and Android distribution over the coming years. Frank Gibeau : Let me take a couple of your questions in line here. As you noted, yes, MAUs have had a very nice growth trend, hitting 155 million in the last quarter in terms of monthly active users. If you parse out what Blake had called out earlier, the freemium revenues within that overall mix are actually up 35%, so MU growth and freemium revenue growth are both doing nicely. We\u2019ve a lot more to do. We are proud of what we have done, but we know we can do better, but that's how I would start to think about how those two are trending. We still have a bit of this overhang of getting past the premium side of the business, which should be in the rearview mirror pretty soon here. As it relates to your argument about \u2013 or your question about CPI, one of the competitive advantages we have at Electronic Arts is we have this incredible diversity and portfolio of brands that have huge audiences out there, and we are able to organically attract people into those brands and into our network much more efficiently than a lot of other mobile gaming companies out there. So as the cost of install or the cost to acquire continues to rise, we have a bit of an unfair advantage in that our brands naturally attract and as well, we\u2019ve a network that is very large in size. Last year, we installed over 635 million games, that generates an audience that we can reach out and touch very effectively and communicate with as they increase their engagement in our games. So if we can keep them in our network, that compounds the advantage that we have in organic acquisition. Those would be two of our offsets in a rapidly growing CPI world that other mobile game companies don't have and we're going to maximize those leverages. That leverage, by investing more in our network to provide more engagement opportunities and more value to our customers, at the same time as we release more of these branded hits like FIFA and SimCity BuildIt. Andrew Wilson : Thanks all for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Q3 was an outstanding quarter for Electronic Arts. Dragon Age : Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists globally. More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week across the world. Madden NFL Mobile had its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching number four on the top grossing charts in the U.S. Apple App Store. And we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console games publisher, a testament to the strength and breadth of EA's IP. Our excellent financial results reflect the strong player engagement and critical success of our titles. Revenue and earnings for Q3 were beyond our guidance, and we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow. At the core, we continue to focus on putting players first. As we listen, learn, and deliver for our communities with games and services that they love to play, we're experiencing new milestones in engagement. On console and PC platforms alone, more than 3.1 billion hours were spent playing EA games in Q3. Dragon Age : Inquisition captivated fans and critics worldwide, as it launched in November, and it quickly became the most successful launch in BioWare history. More than 113 million hours have already been spent exploring the depth and detail of the single-player experience in Dragon Age : Inquisition, and more players are joining each day. Named, Game of the Year, by 32 media outlets around the world, including RGN, Game Informer and the Associated Press, Dragon Age : Inquisition is a true masterpiece from the team at BioWare and a game that is sure to be played for a long time to come. FIFA 15 and Madden NFL 15 also continued to deliver for fans in our third quarter. FIFA 15 was the number one title in Europe and a top 10 title in the U.S. in 2014, with engagement growing in Q3. There were nearly 50% more users logging in each week as compared to Q3 last year. Meanwhile, Madden NFL 15 was the number two best-selling title in North America for 2014 across all genres, and gameplay hours were up 30% year-on-year in Q3. In our Ultimate Team services, engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15, and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year. Our Maxis Studio delivered three major game updates to The Sims 4 during Q3, providing fun new content and adding some of the most wanted community features. Each update has driven more players to engage with The Sims 4, and we have plans to continue delivering fresh content and gameplay to the vibrant Sims community. EA Mobile had a breakout performance over the holiday period. Our EA SPORTS titles are drawing more sports fans in the mobile games, averaging more than 45 million monthly active users during the quarter. Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team led the way, averaging 45% more monthly players through Q3 compared to our previous iterations in the same period last year. The newly launched SimCity BuildIt was downloaded more than 22 million times in the first month, reached the top 5 iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries, and to date players have already logged more than 1.2 billion gameplay sessions. New games like Madden NFL Mobile, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team, and SimCity BuildIt, as well as perennial fan favorites like Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons : Tapped Out, demonstrate one of our key opportunities in mobile, leveraging our IP and specifically designing experiences from the ground up for players on mobile devices. We are listening and learning from the feedback in our mobile community, tuning the experiences based on testing and soft launch periods, then keeping players entertained with new content and challenges. Overall, the momentum that we're seeing across different platforms today gives us great reason to be excited for the future. On consoles, the install base on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 continues to show strong growth, while new players joining on previous-generation consoles are also tapping into our amazing IP catalog. On mobile, innovative games are opening up new growth genres, like sports, with highly-engaged players. On PC, our Origin service continues to grow fiscal year-to-date and offer exciting new ways to play. Across all of these platforms, live services are extending the experience and bringing players deeper into the games they love. With the dynamic nature of this industry, platform preferences, player interests, play patterns and game experiences will constantly evolve. We are confident that through our efforts to put players first, to continue to digitally transform our business and to operate faster and more focused team, we will be in a position of strength to make these industry changes our greatest opportunity. I'll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at Q3 financial performance, then I'll return with a few final thoughts. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior year's, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, strong title performance and expense control, drove operating margins up significantly this quarter to 36.3% from 33.8% last year, and this resulted in excellent cash generation and earnings. This extraordinary performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15, and Dragon Age : Inquisition. In particular, Dragon Age : Inquisition had by far the most successful launch in BioWare's history, exceeding our expectations. In addition, game sales for last-generation consoles were also much stronger than we had anticipated. FX negatively impacted revenue by about $20 million this quarter, but our hedging program offset about half of this, and combined with the natural hedging from our international operations, largely neutralized its impact on earnings. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 34% year-over-year to $693 million, 49% of this quarter's revenue and a new high. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was also a record, up 17% to $2.18 billion. This is the first time digital sales have generated more than half our revenue in a 12-month period. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performances of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $314 million, up 47% over the prior year, with Ultimate Team continuing its strong performance across our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL franchises, up 82% year-over-year in total. FIFA Online 3 in Korea continues to grow year-over-year, and the early indications from our partner in China, Tencent, are that it is already performing extremely well. Star Wars : The Old Republic, also contributed to the segment with the expansion, Shadow of Revan, attracting many more people into the game with its epic new storyline. Star Wars fans remain deeply engaged in The Old Republic universe, and we're more excited to see how that will build, as we get closer to the launch of the Star Wars movie this December. Mobile generated a record $139 million in the quarter, up 13% over the prior year. A $125 million or 90% of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 28% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $14 million, down 44% compared to the prior year. Mobile had a strong December in particular, driven by the success of SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Mobile as well as continued strength in the rest of our mobile portfolio. Leveraging proven IP like this reduces the cost of player acquisition and drives the long-term profitability of our mobile business. SimCity BuildIt has proven to be a highly engaging title that has been a top-10 grossing one on iPhones in 85 countries and on iPad in more than 100. Full game PC and console downloads generated $140 million in revenue, up 22% over the prior year, driven by growth in the installed base of PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Although, the percentage varies considerably by title, platform and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues. Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $100 million, up 52% over the same period last year. The primary growth driver was Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access, our subscription service for Xbox One, continues to grow and we're seeing subscribers play more games, engaging more broadly with EA's offerings. Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 72.8%, an increase from last year's 68.1% and better than our guidance of 70.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to growth in our digital business, strength in current-generation consoles and a one-time benefit from NHL revenue deferred from the second quarter. This was partly offset by the higher proportion of sales from royalty-bearing titles in this quarter compared to last year's Q3. Outperformance versus our outlook was driven by the record-breaking Dragon Age : Inquisition performance. In addition, sell-through was extremely healthy across the market, enabling us to maintain margins above our expectations, while keeping channel inventory clean. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $521 million, down 4% year-on-year, $19 million below prior year, but $6 million above our guidance. Compared to last year, we were able to continue to reduce advertising spend by focusing on fewer frontline titles and increasing the efficiency of the way we advertise. This was partially offset by an increase in the accruals we made for variable compensation and legal expenses, which were not in our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.22 per share, $0.32 better than guidance due to strong revenue, higher gross margin and continued cost control. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.94 billion or approximately $9.48 per share. 66% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $682 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $1.15 billion, a record for this period. During Q3, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $97 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May 2014 and has a two year timeframe. The current rate of purchase keeps us on track to complete the full $750 million in that time. Turning to guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance. For fiscal year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $78 million to $4.253 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will be increased by $0.30 to $2.35 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of nearly 24%. Although this guidance passes through essentially all of the Q3 earnings outperformance to the full year, it does not pass through all the revenue. The reduction in our Q4 revenue expectation is based on uncertainty around future currency movements and the decision to move EA SPORTS PGA TOUR and the first Sims 4 expansion pack into fiscal '16. In addition, there is uncertainty, as to when we will start to recognize revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China. However, gross margin improvements and continued expense control offset this conservatism in revenue, allowing us to substantially reaffirm our Q4 earnings expectations. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.485 billion in revenue and $2.57 in fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.05 billion, which would be the largest fiscal year cash flow in the company's history. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $950 million. Guidance for our fourth quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $830 million, a 9% decrease compared to last year's $914 million. The year-on-year difference is largely driven by Battlefield 4 catalog sales, which were very strong in Q4 fiscal '14, the quarter immediately after we shipped Battlefield. Our next major launch title, Battlefield Hardline, will start to ship in the third week of March, so its impact on the quarter will be limited, even though we expect it to build into a significant title through next fiscal year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 74%. We expect our Q4 operating expenses to be $515 million on a non-GAAP basis. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.22 per share as compared to $0.48 last year. Our Q4 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion as compared to $1.12 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.07 as compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year. We're pleased with our third quarter results, and most importantly, with the consistent growth of cash flow and earnings. We're well ahead of where we expected to be at this stage of our transformation, largely as a result of the strength of our digital live services strategy, our ability to control costs and the continued great commitment of our employees to drive performance, but there is plenty more opportunities ahead of us. We expect these factors will continue to drive growth in cash flow and earnings, and to be augmented by a growing mobile business, as we continue to apply our core IP to this platform. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. It was a great Q3, and there's more to be excited about as we look to Q4 and beyond. The launch of Battlefield Hardline will be the culmination of efforts by the team at Visceral and across EA, to engage our players and deliver a rich and innovative new experience. Battlefield Hardline is a fresh combination of speed, story and strategy, a mix of an engaging single-player campaign inspired by popular TV dramas, new speed-based multiplayer experiences and classic Battlefield multiplayer modes. We are getting great response to the game in recent playtests, and we look forward to opening it up to the community with the upcoming multiplayer beta. This is a fast, fun and intense new experience, and we think players are going to love it. We look forward to launching this new take on Battlefield beginning on March 17. Our slate for the coming year demonstrates EA's commitment to exciting players through brand-new experiences as well as our live services. Players in our current experiences, including Dragon Age : Inquisition, The Sims 4, the EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield 4 will continue to see updates and new content in the future.  We will now launch PGA TOUR in Q1 FY '16, in line with some of golf's biggest tournaments, and it will be joined by our line-up of annual EA SPORTS titles next year. Our Need for Speed franchise will return in FY '16 with a game that is already looking spectacular. And, of course, the new blockbuster Star Wars Battlefront is set to release in the holiday quarter this year. We'll share our full FY '16 calendar, including a slate of new mobile games, during our next quarterly call. I said earlier in the call that the very nature of the games industry is that it is dynamic and constantly evolving. That plays to the strengths of Electronic Arts. Change is one of the constants in the history of this company, and we continue to challenge ourselves to listen, learn and lead an exciting new future for gaming and our players. You will see us focus on our player relationships, to engage and understand what inspires each gamer to play. You will see us investing in new IP and innovation, from ground-up new experiences to cutting-edge digital services. And you will see us focus on quality at every turn, stability in our services and delivery of long-lasting fun with games that are played for months and years, not just days or weeks. Throughout FY '15, EA has focused on putting our players first and strengthening the foundation of our business. We now look forward to a strong finish in Q4, and carrying momentum from FY '15 into FY '16.  Now, Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions. Chris Evenden : Gabriella, if we could open up Q&A now please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Colin Sebastian, Robert Baird. Colin Sebastian : I guess, first off following up on the commentary regarding the full-game downloads, console games, I wonder if you could quantify the mix of digital versus physical? And then how much of the downloads are driven by promotions and bundles? And then secondly, regarding the market for last-gen games, you mentioned this segment exceeded your expectations, I wonder if we can now say that that portion of the market has stabilized or is that specific to what you're doing over the holiday period? Peter Moore : So 100% of full-game downloads are digital from a mix perspective. As I've said on previous calls, we're seeing about 15% of our sales come from full-game downloads via primarily the Sony and Microsoft platforms, of course, as well as our Origin platform. I will say in the last couple of weeks to your question that we've seen an interesting and encouraging pickup in our sport titles in particular where we're seeing this significant increase above that number for full-game downloads on the console and PC platforms. As regards, current-gen or Xbox 360, PS3 platforms, we saw about $100 million in incremental revenue in Q3 on those platforms, I think driven by a number of factors. I think it's been great value for consumers to pick those consoles up at this stage in their lifecycle, I think Sony and Microsoft continue to support them well. There is a great portfolio of titles. And in particular what Electronic Arts brings is blockbuster IP that gamers are very familiar with, and there're relatively easy purchases. We are also seeing strong digital pick up on those platforms as well. Blake Jorgensen : Just to follow-up on Peter's point on full-game downloads, I think you'd asked \u2013 trying to get a sense of how much of that was coming through bundling. We did have some bundles in the quarter, but not substantially more than we would normally have. So the real full-game download trend is being driven primarily by full-game downloads on the new generation consoles. One phenomenon, though, we do see in the Christmas holidays is that people like to give physical gifts that fit under the tree or wherever you do your gift giving. And so oftentimes, we don't see the pickup in full-game downloads until after people have played their first round of games they've gotten for Christmas presents, and Peter's point was we have seen a just most recent pickup in the last couple of weeks of full-game downloads, which would tie back to the notion that people are now starting to really understand the power of their new consoles and starting to pick that up. Peter Moore : And this is the convenience factor, I think, kicks in there. Colin Sebastian : So the 15% that's digital that you mentioned, Peter, that's specific over the holiday period, and you'd expect it to be higher than that. Peter Moore : Colin, that's been our rate for the last two or three quarters, but as I said, we are starting to see a pickup in that. To Blake's point, I think what we are seeing is consumers finding the convenience of full-game digital downloads from Xbox Live and PlayStation network, as they buy their next games after they consumed their games, they got their physical games for the holidays. Operator : Our next question will come from Edward Williams with BMO Capital. Edward Williams : A couple of questions. Can you give us a little bit more detail about how EA Access is performing? And Blake, if you can elaborate a little bit more on what sort of an FX impact we're seeing in your operating expenses? Blake Jorgensen : So on EA Access, I'll let Peter address that first and then I'll talk about the FX. Peter Moore : Yes. EA Access continues to perform extremely well, Edward. Not giving numbers yet, but as you know, it's Xbox One exclusively, but we are seeing significant increase. We're seeing better positioning on the Xbox Live Dashboard for the product. I think gamers are seeing great value for money and the three legs of the stool that is EA Access. Obviously, the early trial, the discounted elements of what we do in particular and the ability to access a vault now, which continues to grow with its titles. And we're seeing significant playtime on EA Access as well as what we believe now is consumers buying games, as they become available and launches are being, in particular our iterative titles. So I think we're optimistic that that will continue to grow as we go into FY '16 in particular, but a great start for EA Access. Blake Jorgensen : On FX, we have a hedging program in place, where the objective is to reduce the impact of currency moves on operating income and cash flow. And in addition, we actually get a natural hedge based on the fact that we have substantial number of employees and offices in Europe as well as in Canada. And we tend to focus on four core currencies, the euro, British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Swedish krona, which are really the four core centers of where we have employees as well as where our core revenue exists. We're exposed to other currencies beyond that because they're not as large in the overall mix. The reality is that we're able to hedge our revenue, but rarely can we hedge a 100% of that. We're able to hedge partially because of actual hedges and partially because of natural hedges, more of our operating income swing. So we tend to see a larger swing on the topline that we do on the bottomline. This quarter, we saw virtually no impact on the bottom line, and as I said about a $20 million impact on the topline. The real unknown for us going forward is exactly what we think the euro is going to look like six to nine months out, where our hedges are less impactful going forward. We'll know more when we give guidance in May for the full year. We see a little risk in the fourth quarter, if you see continued decline in the euro. But I think the big unknown for us is what does the euro look like all through our next fiscal year and does that present a risk, and we'll give you an update and we're doing our best to try to hedge out as much of that risk as possible. Operator : Our next question will come from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne, Agee. Arvind Bhatia : I wanted to see if you guys could maybe talk about how you are viewing the market for next year in light of the success you've had with the next gen. But also the stability that seems to be happening on the old gen just as that mix changes, how do you view the market growth? And then you guys have been exceeding your margin goals consistently and that's been great. Just wondering if, Blake, you would take a shot at maybe a medium-term operating margin goal going forward, in light of all the cost savings you've already realized and how sort of the gross margin benefit you've gotten from the mix? Blake Jorgensen : Let Andrew start and then I'll come back to the operating margins question. Andrew Wilson : As we look at the year ahead, we are very confident. We're seeing continued uptake of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The new boost that we had through this quarter on what was Xbox 316 and PlayStation 3 is also a very good for us. Again, we have a very, very strong portfolio of titles. And we would expect that we will continue to benefit as both generations of consoles continue to show strength and growth, albeit for different markets, given the breadth and the strength of our portfolio. In addition to that, we're seeing continued engagement with our live services, and players playing longer and engaging deeper with those live services across both generations of console. And as we've talked about, we had a very strong quarter with respect to mobile and we're starting to see that value of our IP combined with the learning experiences that we've had over the past couple of years with respect to mobile. So all-in-all, when we think about two console generations of strength, we think about ongoing engagement with our live services, and we start to see the benefits of the learning and the strength of our portfolio in mobile, we feel very good about the year ahead. Blake Jorgensen : When it comes to the operating margin, we're not yet ready to give sort of next year's guidance or even a longer-term guidance on our operating model. But we will in May talk a little bit about multiple year potential here. I'll use the time though to remind people that we, about two-and-a-half years ago, we were in the single-digit area and through focus of the entire organization and the whole management team, we've really pushed to change how we operate, both from a consumer perspective very focused on a gamer first mentality and second on a financial perspective. And that's allowed us to move into what looks like now roughly 24% operating margin for the year with obviously this quarter showing operating margin well under the mid-30. We do believe that we've got potential continued upside on the gross margin side of the business as we push our digital business, and as we add more and more revenue via either digital live services or mobile, we think that will continue to benefit us through some operating leverage and give us more operating upside. We kind of view the first stage of this change as the turnaround. We feel that that's been done and now it's really time to focus on the transition and transformation that we believe as a potential here, driving much higher operating margins and cash flows overtime. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Chris Merwin : First question is just, as it relates to your cash flow guidance, it looks like that came up by about $200 million for the full year. I think it was about $100 million more than net income. So maybe, Blake, if you could just talk about what's improving free cash flow conversion? And if that's something we should expect to continue going forward? And then, just secondly, I was hoping if you could just please provide some more color around how FIFA Online 3 is doing in China? How is that compared to the launch in South Korea, just in terms of the user growth and monetization? Blake Jorgensen : So I'll start on the cash flow, and then Andrew or Peter can weigh in on FIFA in China. Cash flow there's a couple of benefits, one, is just obviously the strength in the business across the board and the strength in our physical retail partners, I think helps people pay faster when they're in a stronger position. And then, second, our digital business obviously fuels a much faster cash collection cycle. There is relatively little inventory in the channel. That's a very good positive for us. And all that comes together and try to drive significantly upside on our cash flow. We've been continuing to manage our CapEx aggressively, and that's helping on the free cash flow side of the business. But I'd say the bulk of it is really just a flow-through from the real strength in the operating earnings that are coming out of the business, as we're really hitting on all cylinders. Peter Moore : Our FIFA Online 3 in China, as you know, being published by our partner Tencent there, we're still yet to get to the official launch, but we're in a very strong soft launch period right now. Tencent themselves announced in December that they have reached 500,000 peak concurrent users, which was a new record for a sports title in that marketplace. So all of the key indicators are very, very positive. We expect at some point in this quarter to go fully live. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're yet to determine when to recognize revenue against this title. But all key indications are that this is record breaking stuff. We're very optimistic, but more primarily an impact on FY '16 at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson : You're talking about higher engagement in live services and moving from a transition phase to kind of a transformation phase. Can you give us a sense for how you envision EA's business model will evolve maybe over the next three to five years? I realize that's light years away from now. But how should we think about EA's mix of revenue from newer business models, like subscription or free-to-play or other digital models, and maybe kind of compared to traditional retail physical disc sales, et cetera? Andrew Wilson : As Blake has talked about and as Peter has talked about, we are definitely seeing a greater trend towards digital revenue and over this quarter certainly that trend continued. As we look to the future and we think about the various opportunities inside of digital revenue, we look a lot at our adjacent media companies that provide music and television and movies, and recognize that an opportunity for us is to capture the greatest possible share through the offering of multiple consumption models. So as we've talked about on calls in the past, we have been investing for some years now in a digital platform that will facilitate transactions in any number of ways, either through a free-to-play micro transactions-driven model, a premium download model or a subscription model or some combination of those things. So as we think about our digital future, we are really looking at various platforms, various markets and various business models in that digital realm and looking to offer that in a way that any particular player might want to consume the great games that we make. Chris Evenden : Next question please, Gabriella. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Ryan Gee : This is Ryan Gee calling in for Justin Post. Just two quick questions on the digital business. First, it's encouraging to see the growth of Ultimate Team, both players and sales. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers last quarter. Was there anything in particular about this year or last year we need to keep in mind and whether this growth trend that you are seeing there is sustainable? And then second, the growth in Ultimate Team compares to the mobile business, which around 13% is tracking below the digital average. Can you talk about your plan to either reaccelerate that business or as feature phones or there is still a headwind that we should be looking at going forward? Blake Jorgensen : Why don't I start and then I can toss it to Frank. The one reminder is underlying growth in mobile is really 28%, if you pull that premium business out, which it's a legacy for us. It's down to about $40 million a year and declining year-over-year. We can't force that any faster than we are already doing, because it's embedded in a lot of way people play games still. But Frank can talk about the exciting growth idea as well as growth that we're seeing in the mobile business. First, just on the Ultimate Team side of the equation, the key for us in Ultimate Team right now has been discovery, making sure people understand what it is and how exciting and fun it is. Still a smaller portion than -- of all the people that buy the game, less than half of people actually enter into Ultimate Team, and a small fraction of those people actually get heavily involved in Ultimate Team and ultimately monetize. And so part of our goal is increasing visibility of Ultimate Team and making sure that people understand how to play it and how fun it is. So you see, when you load up the Madden disk for the first time, you see Ultimate Team come up on your screen. We're trying to make sure people understand, get into the funnel essentially and understand how passionate and powerful it is, as you start to play it. And we are trying to encourage people to play with their friends, and so you'll see more and more of that drive Ultimate Team. Clearly, it's of a scale today, that you question how much larger can I get, but we're surprised every quarter about continued growth. And we do know particularly how much people love it, particularly how much opportunity there could still be going forward. So exciting times ahead and we're looking at ways that we can leverage an Ultimate Team mechanic and more games than we currently have, even non-sport style games. Frank Gibeau : The question on mobile, really what I'd draw your attention to is the new releases that we put out with Madden, FIFA and SimCity BuildIt, which were built from the ground up as freemium services. We've spent the first part of this year taking the best and brightest from inside Electronic Arts as well as from outside, bringing in from the industry, to build a world-class mobile team. And those three products really represent what we believe the future potential of big brands with natural organic acquisition advantages coupled with great quality, great technology and a focus on engagement and live service represents. So in the quarter, if you strip away the headwind from the premium download business, we're growing around 28%. But that growth actually accelerated as we stepped into December and we picked up share there, with the release of SimCity. And our next product up Need for Speed BuildIt, another huge brand that will acquire very well. We have to build from the ground up freemium service layer. We're really bullish on how the slate will unfold going forward and really drive that growth rate that's currently in the high-20s to something that we're pretty proud of. Ryan Gee : And then one follow-up quick question, if I may. We saw in the NPD, the retail data in December, that there was some weakness in the average selling prices, particularly on the new-gen consoles. Is that something that you guys have seen in early January continue? And is that something we should be concerned about maybe in '15, just faster price cutting by retailers? Peter Moore : No. I don't believe so. I think Ryan what you were seeing was maybe some promotional short-term promotional as retailers, particularly here in North America, we're trying to gain market share over the holiday period. I think things then revert to normal. I haven't seen that. My teams in the field haven't seen it. I think what you saw was a short-term blip. Blake Jorgensen : And you guys have heard me say this before, but I'll say it again, and that is, be really careful using NPD data, it's becoming less and less valuable, as more and more of the business is going digital. And there is obviously not a digital comparison to it. But both in volume and in pricing, it can be sometimes a very large distraction, and then when you add in that there is no international piece to it. It really underestimates the strength of our business, I think as you can see in this quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum : I wonder if you could comment further around Battlefield Hardline. I think you suggested that it would not be material to fiscal fourth quarter numbers. Is that from a revenue perspective or is that apply to profit as well? And should we expect most of it to shift to the first quarter of fiscal 2016? And then on gross margin, I have two questions. Can you pull out the NHL benefit you saw in the quarter? And then, Blake, just thinking kind of longer-term, your gross margin guidance for fiscal '15 is now above 70%, but digital is a little more than 50% of total non-GAAP revenue. Any thoughts on longer-term gross margin upside for the business? Blake Jorgensen : Don't take my comment on Hardline to be in any way negative. It was simply to say that we don't ship it until the third week of March, and so it's primarily a sell-in only and we'll see a very large impact as we roll into next year with that title. As an example, right now the levels of people playing Battlefield 4 are some of the highest we've seen in the last year. And so people play and buy Battlefield products for a long time and in the future. And so we think the selling will be very strong for Hardline, it will be important for the quarter, but I think it's a strong indicator going forward. Andrew Wilson : Yes, Drew, just want to add to Blake's comments there. It's a great window for us and our retailers around the world see this late March window, to Blake's point, not hugely material for the quarter, because it will be what we call an initial purchase quantity or a one-day load, and then a little bit of replenishment. Huge opportunity I think for FY '16, but retailers like GameStop here in North America in particular, always see this as a go-big title are really getting behind it. And we're seeing the same across the rest of the world. I think it's a huge opportunity for us to be able to reestablish a new offshoot for the franchise that is Battlefield. As Blake said, it's one shot on the quarter but FY '16 looks very strong, when we look at our forecast for this title. Blake Jorgensen : As Andrew mentioned, the speed and the excitement of the game exceeds almost anything we've done in the Battlefield franchise. And I think that's going to really catch people by surprise and you're going to see a lot of people -- the momentum is going to build on it as more and more people start to play it and want their friends to be able to come in and play it. The things you're able to do is vehicles, with weapons in the urban centers, it is jut almost unbelievable and you will start to see more and more screen, more and more live game play of that over the next few weeks as we start to crank up the marketing activity. And then obviously, the beta that Andrew mentioned. So more to come there, it's pretty exciting though. On the gross margin side NHL it was $150 million in terms of revenue that was deferred end of the quarter, and so that really probably took gross margins up by about a point, relative to the overall over delivery of gross margin. And so it obviously helped, that's why we wanted to call it out, we did that because we had more to deliver on NHL, when we did during the quarter and that's why we deferred some of NHL revenue. I think longer-term gross margin, more to come when we give guidance next year, but we do believe that we could operate in the 70% to 74% gross margin longer term. This year, we're in that 70% to 71% and in couple of quarters bouncing higher than that. But we do believe there is potential particularly as we continue to ship that digital business and the live services moving forward, so more to come on them. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey : Two questions. The first one relates to your fiscal '16. And I realize, Blake that you are not providing guidance, but perhaps as a broad stroke how you guys are thinking about your title count growth for frontline console releases in the year? And then your headcount assumption what sort of headcount growth you are thinking about in fiscal '16? Then I have a follow-up. Blake Jorgensen : So first on the title, you should assume all the sports titled obviously will be in their regular rotation. I would assume that we're going to continue to try to double-down as we mentioned on our Ultimate Team and try to expand that business. We have Need for Speed back in the rotation, next year which is the positive. As Frank mentioned, there is Need for Speed coming on mobile, but also we're going to have another couple of unannounced very exciting mobile titles as well in the quarter or in the year. And then, last but far from least, we've got a Battlefront, Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie rollout. We're extremely excited about that and we think there is huge potential for that title. More to come in the next couple of months on that as more about the movie comes out as well as more about our titles comes out, but you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefields in the past. Mike Hickey : And maybe you can talk on headcount, Blake. Blake Jorgensen : I'm sorry, yes. And in terms of headcount, I think our focus on margin and on cost discipline will not stop. We're very focused on that. We're focused on what that means for headcount around the world as well as marketing spent around the world, and that focus is going to stay. So you shouldn't see a dramatic change in headcount, probably think about it roughly as flat. And really our challenge is how do we offset some of the natural increases in compensation cost during the year and we've got everybody trying to drive efficiencies through their business to try to offset some of that. We were remaking some of the headcounts, so we're moving towards more live services, that means more customer service, more live service management, and that will have to be offset by reductions in another places where we can balance that headcount or remix headcount amongst what people do in their day-to-day job. Mike Hickey : And the last question for me is I'm sort of curious how do you think about free-to-play becoming a more viable business model for consoles over the medium term, particularly for sort of multiplayer-only experiences that are starting to pop up a little bit more than prior cycle? Andrew Wilson : On free-to-play with consoles, we think about this much to everything about free-to-play overall. And there is a couple of different vectors to this. The first is, as we look to the future, we believe a very big part of that player base will expect a free-to-start experience. When we look at film, television, music, books very often there is this free trial notion that actually on boards new players, new listeners, new readers or new viewers into a service. We're actively looking at how we could offer that type of experience to our players, console and across other platforms. From there, it really comes down to, do they make their next step in terms of a premium download, a micro-transaction in a free-to-play type environment or a broader relationship through a subscription. And our expectation is that we will be offering all three of those options to players, both console and across other platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham. Sean McGowan : I have a couple of follow-up questions from earlier ones. Blake, on the hedging, I just want to be clear. Are you actively engaged in trying to hedge more than just the transactions that you have and extend that into translation? Blake Jorgensen : So we had both balance sheet cash flow as well as earnings, and we're hedging essentially the core currency that where we operate around the world. So think about it as effectively trying to minimize the swings and exchange rate, the impacts of the swings and exchange rates on our P&L and on our balance sheet. We don't try to place bets to try to make money on hedges. We simply are trying to offset swings that occur. So ideally for us it would be we're constantly neutral to any currency moves. Now, obviously, that's hard to do and it gets expensive. And so when you see rapid changes in FX like we've seen in the last six weeks, it's harder to be able to protect against that over a long-term period of time, because it just gets very expensive to do. So we have rolling hedges that we add overtime to smooth our hedging and we try to make sure that we're protecting both, revenue line, but most importantly the cash flow and the earnings lines. Sean McGowan : But is it safe to say that the driving assumption as you enter those hedged transactions is that the current rate persists or you're making some bet about the direction? Blake Jorgensen : We'll make some bet about the direction, but we're not trying to make a bet about the direction to make money per se. It's just simply to protect where our cash flows are coming from. Sean McGowan : And I'm not sure who should take the next questions, it refers back to the stability that we're now seeing in the old gen, previous generation sales. We've seen some zigging and zagging in recent quarters about that. So is the stability more a function of your expectations getting better honed or is there really a change in the marketplace going on? Peter Moore : I don't think there is a change. We're entering the ninth year of the cycle here. So I think we're seeing the strong tail. I think both Sony and Microsoft to their credit are providing support behind their current gen, between both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It's having been in that side of the business, as you will remember it's a strong opportunity for both of these to continue to leverage the power, that very large installed base. There is a great portfolio of title that stretches back nine years. The hardware is great value for money for consumers that haven't jumped in yet for a console hardware. We were concerned and we were called probably two or three quarters ago that all of the actions was in Xbox One and some PS 4s. But I think what's happened is that that consumers moved on and there is plenty of consumers they are still looking to get involved in games. Great deals for retailers around the world in Q3 and holiday period, and our job obviously is to be able to take full advantage of that, and nobody in the industry has more recognizable blockbusters than Electronic Arts. And I think it's as simple as that our teams are well-positioned with our content, with both our retail partners as well as full game downloads of those titles. And this is where great brands of great IP shines, with consumer that maybe coming in a little late and looking for recognizable content. So I think you can characterize it, as a stable situation. I think as we look at our FY '16 numbers, we expect that to continue and to take full advantage of it. Blake Jorgensen : During the year, there were roughly 3 million old generation console sold here in the U.S. And half of that came in the last two months of the year. So obviously, Christmas discounting probably drove a lot of that sales. And if you're buying a console for the first time, as Peter said, there is a high probability you're going to buy FIFA or Madden or Need for Speed or one of the titles, Battlefield titles that people really know are the great title to play. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Tim OShea : Another question on the balance sheet. You guys ended the calendar year with over $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents, and by my math, I think that's up from about $2.1 billion last year. Just given the elevated levels, I thought it made sense to revisit your current thinking with respect to things like how much cash you need on the balance sheet, about share repurchases and maybe even those 0.75% convertible notes that are due 2016. Just wondering if you are thinking has evolved that as the balance continue to rise? And then I have a quick follow-up. Blake Jorgensen : So clearly, we have flexibility that as we get more and more cash on the balance sheet. We're very focused on making sure that that cash goes back to shareholders in the most efficient way. As we're thinking about our cash needs, obviously the first we think about just the general operating needs, and we always are weighing on the notion that now 60% of that cash is sitting onshore, but that's a benefit from the repatriation that we did a-year-and-a-half ago or a year ago. There is a natural cash build that occurs internationally and so that will start to deplete over time and will go back to probably a greater cash balance internationally than domestically. Also weighing on our thinking is the current converts that are due in August of next, August calendar year '16. And we're thinking through ways in which we either can refinance those or pay those off, but that clearly weighs on how much cash we hold at least in the interim. And then last but not least, we're very committed to continuing to buyback stock. We are on track to be able to complete the $750 million two-year buyback, and as we generate more cash we'll consider greater buybacks over time. It's not complicated. I think we just have a simple model, which is saying how do we get that back to shareholders. Tim OShea : And then just looking at guidance, it does appear you only drew a portion of the beat to full year. Just curious, is there anything out there in the March quarter that maybe you're a bit more cautious, perhaps around FX or is this just reflects some general conservatism on your behalf? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Well, unfortunately, I guess I'm just starting to think that we're conservative all the time, which I guess we are, which is a good thing. I do remind people, we started the year with guidance of $4.1 billion and $1.85 in EPS and some the original conversations I had with people thought we were crazy to guide that high. And obviously, now we're at $4.253 billion and $2.35. As I said in the call, I think the major driver not flowing through all $150 million of the revenue fee was : first, we decided to move two titles out of the quarter, small titles, but titles nonetheless, PGA Golf and the first Sims expansion pack will both fall into Q1 now. Those are originally in our thinking for Q4. Second, we don't know where FX is going to go. I don't think it's going to go in a lot more, but I said that when the euro was $1.30. So there is some uncertainty there. And then third, we are waiting to see when we'll be able to recognize our revenue on the FIFA Online 3 in China with our partner Tencent. There are some contractual obligations that need to be met and we don't know if those will get met in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter. And so those uncertainties stopped us from flowing all $150 million through, but what we did is flow through essentially the operating income benefits to really flow through the entire EPS in the quarter. Chris Evenden : All right. One last question. Operator : Our final question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Unidentified Analyst : This is Rob on the call for Neil. I just wanted to quickly ask on the nice marketing efficiency that you showed in the quarter. I think if you could just maybe give us a little bit of color on how much of that is due to -- or how are you thinking about and how much of that is due to improvements in game quality versus structural shift to live services versus changes in marketing tactics? Blake Jorgensen : I'll let Peter answer that. The one just simple thing to remember is we didn't have Battlefield this year in the quarter, we had last year in the quarter and Battlefield was scale of a product and going to spend a little bit more money. So that's really just a simple fact, but there are a lot of efficiencies that we're also focused on. Peter Moore : I think, Rob, to answer to your question all of the above, I think it's obviously great to have a title with the quality of Dragon Age : Inquisition, that's not only our great marketing, but then organically grew with the quality of the title and the ability for it to be able to get picked up virally by games who then passed on their recommendations to fellow gamers is something that we see. Secondarily, yes, we've been talking for two, three years now about increased systems and efficiencies that we're applying as a company to watch the way that we communicate with our games. And you're seeing that, you're seeing that in every single quarter, obviously we would continue to ratchet down our expenses without revenues dropping and without our efficiency actually increasing in the way that we communicate directly with our gamers. We track metrics that are based on demand and tend to purchase aided awareness. Those continue to grow across all of our franchises. And our ability to track our consumers on a day-to-day basis rather than simply launch with big TV campaigns, which may have been what we've done many years ago, you are seeing the resulting efficiencies as a result in our marketing spend as a percentage in that revenue and that will continue. Blake Jorgensen : There is one more dynamic, I will just add to that and Peter is right on all fronts. The other dynamic, of course, that's happening is by virtue of our life services and the ongoing engagement with our players, we are now more connected with our player base for much, much longer. And so the need to go out and kind of re-recruit players who we may have had a disconnect with or a disengagement with is something that we are not having to encounter at the same rate that we maybe did two, three years ago. So there's ongoing shift to a life services philosophy, it's not just helping it in terms of the ability to deliver amazing experiences to our players, but also it's keeping us connected with them, so that we can ensure that they know about the latest, greatest experiences that we have. End of Q&A Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time today. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : And with that, we conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

You may begin. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jen. Welcome to EA's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Frank Gibeau, our EVP of Mobile, and Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, and a transcript. A couple of quick notes on our calendar; the date of our next earnings call will be Thursday, July 30. And our E3 press conference 1 :00 PM Pacific Time on Monday, June 15. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of May 5, 2015, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. FY 2015 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global best-sellers, and breakout hits. Our live services for franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, Madden NFL, and The Sims are thriving. The communities in our mobile titles continue to grow. And through constant dialogue, we are forging deeper relationships with our players. We broadened our portfolio on key platforms, introduced new service models, and delivered quality through stable, scalable, and innovative experiences. All of this contributed to outstanding player engagement in EA experiences across console, PC, and mobile in FY 2015. Our financial results were consistently strong throughout the year. Revenue and EPS were above our guidance for the full fiscal year, and we have reached an all-time high in operating cash flow. EA today is performing with focus and efficiency, and we're leaning into our strengths to deliver great experiences to a growing and diverse audience of players around the world. Dragon Age : Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline are both terrific examples of the focus we have today. Moving launch dates is never easy, but we are committed to making the hard decisions that will benefit our players. With Dragon Age : Inquisition, those extra few weeks of polish allowed BioWare to deliver a truly epic new experience. Not only did it win dozens of Game of the Year awards. More importantly, our players gave it the highest form of praise, with nearly 200 million hours of Dragon Age : Inquisition played life to date. Our Visceral team opened up to player feedback earlier and more than ever before while developing Battlefield Hardline, and the input from our community was a catalyst for greater innovation. With the added development time, Battlefield Hardline delivered a complete package for different types of play : core strategy-based Battlefield gameplay that our fans love; fast and fun new multiplayer modes like Hotwire; as well as a deep story-driven single-player campaign. We are very happy with how well the game has sold to date, and more importantly, that we've brought many new fans into the Battlefield universe. Meanwhile, EA SPORTS had one of its best performances ever. Nearly six months after launch, FIFA 15 remains a top-five title in the Western world, with more than 18 million matches played on average every day in Q4. Gameplay hours of Madden NFL 15 were up nearly 30% for the quarter over last year, and the hours played in Madden NFL Ultimate Team in the quarter increased a massive 97% year over year. Passionate sports fans are spending more time in our games today and engaging in our Ultimate Team modes to extend the fun long after the season is over. We continue to see major growth in player engagement with our live services and digital offerings across all platforms. Our investments in Battlefield 4 brought greater stability to the experience and allowed us to apply our learnings to ensure that Battlefield Hardline was stable and scalable at launch and beyond. We now have two Battlefield experiences with large, highly engaged audiences, and both will receive new expansion packs in the coming months. Other services are showing strong momentum with players as well. Monthly engagement levels on Origin were up significantly over the previous year, and the subscriber base for EA Access continues to grow as we learn more about the innovative new delivery model on console. For players on smartphones and tablets, we've built a strong foundation of key titles, and now we're adding to it. Players are going deeper into SimCity BuildIt, logging more than 2.4 billion game sessions in Q4. And Madden NFL Mobile continues to capture more sports gamers, with gameplay up 25% over the previous quarter. But perhaps the greatest example of our core strength in mobile, designing experiences that will provide years of entertainment, is The Simpsons : Tapped Out. Nearly three years after launch, The Simpsons : Tapped Out averaged more than 16 million monthly players throughout FY 2015. We are building some excellent momentum in our mobile business, and we're excited to launch new Minions and Star Wars experiences later this year. In FY 2015, we captured hundreds of millions of players with new RPG, sports, shooter, simulation, and casual experiences across console, PC, and mobile devices. Now as we look at the opportunities ahead of us in FY 2016, we are positioned to build relationships with millions more through entirely new experiences as well as new games in our major franchises. Just three weeks ago, the world got its latest look at Star Wars Battlefront from our DICE studio. The reaction has been powerful. Our Star Wars Battlefront trailer has been watched more than 29 million times to date across social platforms. Brought to life through an unprecedented partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm, Star Wars Battlefront will immerse players into the Star Wars universe like never before. The power of our Frostbite engine technology enables us to deliver intricately detailed visuals and a completely authentic environment for players to live out their Star Wars fantasies. Anticipation is now building for the launch of Star Wars Battlefront in November, and we're excited to be a part of one of the biggest global pop culture events of the year with the return of Star Wars. We look forward to showing more of Star Wars Battlefront to players at E3 in just a few weeks. In addition to Star Wars Battlefront, we will leverage the breadth of our IP to reach a wider audience of players across multiple genres and platforms in FY 2016. EA SPORTS will excite fans throughout the summer and fall with the latest releases of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, and NBA Live, including industry-leading gameplay, compelling new features, and fresh Ultimate Team experiences. FY 2016 will see the return of Need for Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well as a new mobile game. Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game packs, and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 player community. After Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare became a sensation last year with console players young and old, we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience in FY 2016 that we'll share more about at E3. Minions Paradise, our first game with the popular franchise in partnership with Illumination Entertainment, will be one of at least five new EA Mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its stunning first-person gameplay. And of course we'll continue to bring new content to our communities in Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 4, Dragon Age : Inquisition, Star Wars : The Old Republic, our EA SPORTS titles, and EA Mobile games. Our live services will continue to keep these experiences fresh and fun for players throughout the year. Across the world today, more people are playing games and spending more time playing games than ever before. The audience is wider and more diverse than we have ever known. Games are truly becoming the best form of entertainment, and EA is well positioned to benefit. Building relationships with new players and strengthening existing ones through meaningful engagement is at the core of our objectives as a company. We are continuing to invest in our digital platform, infrastructure, security, live service systems, and community engagement teams to scale to the needs of a growing global player base that hold games as a vital and intrinsic part of their lives. FY 2015 was a transformative year for EA, as we put our players first, delivered amazing high-quality games and services, and drove greater speed and efficiency into our business. I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and a view into the year ahead. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years. When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take three years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in two years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal 2015 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points, from 56% of net revenue in FY 2013 to just 46% in FY 2015. And we've done so without adversely impacting our revenue or the effectiveness of our R&D or marketing. This year we delivered the best Dragon Age of all time, grew our sports franchises, expanded a core franchise with Battlefield Hardline, and announced new IP, including Star Wars Battlefront. In addition, we've continued to grow our digital live services and leveraged our IP portfolio to establish a strong position on mobile platforms. Our core product catalog and digital live services are helping the company deliver more consistent, repeatable revenue and cash flow each year. These improvements have more than quadrupled our free cash flow over the same period, from $218 million in FY 2013 to $972 million in FY 2015, and driven a threefold increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS, from $0.84 a share to $2.51 a share. But there's plenty of road left to travel on our journey to build both great games and shareholder value. Most significantly, the digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy. This transformation presents opportunity to continue to grow margins by increasing the proportion of full-game downloads, by providing extra content for games, and by taking our IP to mobile platforms. Downloads of our games for current-generation consoles continue to increase. Meanwhile, our extra content and subscription strategy generated $1.3 billion in net revenue in FY 2015 and continues to grow strongly. Finally, our mobile business at $524 million is now the third-largest in western markets and the eighth-largest worldwide, and we anticipate continued healthy growth going forward. As well as driving gross margin improvement, we continue to look for opportunities to better leverage our investments. For example, our digital platform strategy will help us better understand and engage with gamers for more efficiency. And standardizing on one game engine across studios amortizes core technology development across all our titles and accelerates our innovation. Bottom line, we believe we can continue to grow non-GAAP EPS into the future. Moving to the fourth quarter results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $896 million, which was $66 million above our guidance and $18 million below last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by sales of Battlefield Hardline and the ongoing strength of our catalog titles. In addition, our mobile business continued to grow, led by SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, The Sims FreePlay, and The Simpsons : Tapped Out. One note, because FIFA Online 3 was launched in China in April, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4. We expect to start recognizing revenue for this service in Q1 FY 2016. EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $602 million. This resulted in a fiscal year digital revenue of more than $2.2 billion, about 52% of total revenue. Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $247 million, up 2% over the prior year. The growth of extra content slowed this quarter due to FX headwinds resulting from the fact that most of the FIFA Ultimate Team business is in Europe, and from changes we made to reduce illegitimate coin selling in FIFA Ultimate Team. Nevertheless, for the year FIFA Ultimate Team expanded over 40%, and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. Overall, Ultimate Team grew 53% on top of the prior year's 62% growth. We took steps during the quarter to reduce the trading of illegitimate FIFA Ultimate Team coins, which had distorted the economy and made it difficult for many players to build the team they wanted. We've made changes to limit the game exploits and automated processes that used to generate those coins and taken steps to rebalance the game economy. However, some risks remain, and we've factored those into our Q1 and full-year guidance. Second, our mobile business generated $150 million for the quarter, up 22% over prior year. Premium mobile only accounted for $9 million of the mobile revenue this quarter. Excluding premium, our ongoing mobile business grew 38% year on year. Third, full-game downloads added $114 million to the quarter, flat year on year, with strong sales of Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age : Inquisition, and The Sims 4 offsetting the fall-off in Battlefield 4 and Titanfall sales. Our Origin service for PC gamers increased its monthly player engagement levels by two-thirds over the previous year and continues to strongly grow revenues and users. And finally, subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue totaled $91 million, up $22 million or 32% over the same period last year, driven largely by Battlefield 4 Premium. EA Access again outperformed, and we expect its contribution to accelerate this year as we start to promote this service with Microsoft and continue to add titles to the EA Access Vault. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 75.4%, 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline. It was down from 77.4% in Q4 fiscal 2014, primarily due to the strength of our sports titles. Operating expenses for the quarter were $513 million, up $10 million from last year and $2 million lower than our guidance. The year-on-year increase is primarily due to marketing expenses for Battlefield Hardline. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per share, $0.17 above our guidance. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $198 million compared to $281 million in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of titles. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.07 billion, a very significant increase over last year's cash flow of $712 million, and above our twice-revised guidance. Fiscal year 2015 capital expenditures were $95 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $972 million. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.02 billion or $9.75 per share. Approximately 62% of this was held in the U.S. During the quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.44 per share. We far surpassed our expectations for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, we exceeded our original revenue guidance by $219 million, gross margin by 250 basis points, operating cash flow by $267 million, and EPS by $0.66 a share. The new EA is delivering more consistent revenue, increasing the proportion of high-margin digital revenue, and growing operating margins, earnings, and cash flow. This has given the board confidence to authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program has a two-year timeframe and replaces the remaining $356 million portion of our previous $750 million buyback program. It represents an expected return to shareholders of approximately 50% of forecasted free cash flow. On to fiscal 2016 guidance; with regards to the market, we expect the console transition to continue at a rapid pace, and another 22 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 27 million units in place at the end of calendar 2014. This is much faster growth than in previous generations. Illustrating how far the transition has already come, approximately four out of every five copies of Battlefield Hardline sold for consoles that were either Xbox One or PlayStation 4. In addition to the console growth, we are expecting our mobile franchise to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android. We're anticipating the installed base to grow by over 600 million to nearly 3 billion devices by the end of calendar 2015. On a constant-currency basis, we expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 8% to $4.65 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based and driven by the launch of Star Wars Battlefront, the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, the expansion of our mobile business, and the addition of new Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, and Plants vs. Zombies titles, as well as some other unannounced games. We expect foreign exchange rates will have an impact on our forecasted results. At our FY 2016 guided exchange rates, we anticipate an FX headwind of approximately $250 million, leading to our expectation for non-GAAP revenue of $4.4 billion. Volatility in exchange rates during the year may cause us to reconsider these assumptions, and we'll update you on a quarterly basis. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise about 50 basis points to 71.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue. This forecast reflects gross margin pressure from product mix, as one of our major launches this year is Star Wars Battlefront, a royalty-bearing title. As a reminder, the major non-sports titles last year were Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age : Inquisition, and The Sims 4, all of which are wholly-owned IP. Although the dollar's rise has a negative impact on revenue, it has a positive impact on expenses since about 46% of our R&D expense is outside the U.S. This natural hedge is worth approximately $100 million in FY 2016 and offsets the increased investment we're planning for new IP and our digital platform. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating expense of $1.98 billion, marginally down compared to fiscal 2015. This would deliver an operating margin of approximately 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75, up 10% year on year. This includes an adverse impact of $0.21 from FX and a benefit of $0.11 due to a change in tax rate. The strong growth of our business outside of the United States is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate such that we now view our long term non-GAAP tax rate to be 22% instead of 25%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance does not factor in any share repurchases that may take place during the year. The earnings presentation on our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year. On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.25 billion, gross margin of 69.4%, and EPS of $1.90. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into key drivers of our full-year non-GAAP revenue guidance. As a note, all of these revenue numbers assumed guidance exchange rates. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $1.85 billion, down 11%, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery. Digital revenue is forecasted to be nearly $2.55 billion, up 14%. Breaking down our digital revenue into its four primary categories, we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 25% as we broaden our revenue base through the launch of more free-to-download games based on our own IP, such as Need for Speed and licensed IP such as Star Wars and Minions, while continuing to generate income from existing titles. In addition, the headwind remaining from the winding down of our premium mobile business is now very small. Revenue for full-game downloads is anticipated to grow in line with last year's growth. Full-game downloads on current-generation consoles are now over 20% for a newly-launched game, and we're seeing higher percentages for our catalog titles. As a reminder, we count bundled games as physical sales, regardless of whether it's a disk or a downloaded code in a box with a console. 've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010, and we believe the same forces that drove this on the PC are at play on the latest generation of consoles. Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by FIFA Online 3 and Ultimate Team. Our strongest markets for Ultimate Team are overseas, so this forecast bakes in a significant FX headwind as well as the changes we've made to improve the FIFA Ultimate Team experience. Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 15% to 20% this year, driven by a fall-off in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue, partially offset by growth in the EA Access and by Battlefield Hardline Premium revenue. GAAP operating expenses for the fiscal year are expected to be around $2.17 billion. Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal year 2016, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion and capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.05 billion versus $972 million in fiscal 2015. Focusing on Q1, our Q1 is seasonally the quietest of our fiscal year. And although we have no major launches this quarter, we do anticipate strong catalog sales, particularly of FIFA 15 and of Battlefield Hardline, which launched at the very end of Q4. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.14 as compared to $1.04 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, a 17% decrease compared to last year's $775 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Titanfall, the launch of 2014 FIFA World Cup and UFC, and from Battlefield 4 catalog. The decline is offset by Battlefield Hardline catalog, but we are not planning any HD launches this quarter. Our revenue phasing for FY 2016 is different to the prior year, with a much larger proportion in the back half due to our launch schedule. The expected phasing of our revenue is in the earnings presentation posted to our website. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, $16 million higher compared to last year, driven by the extra week in the quarter, offset somewhat by more favorable exchange rates for overseas expenses. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be zero cents per share as compared to $0.19 per share last year. Looking further into the future, we remain focused on driving our business model and improving profitability. We will continue to leverage one of the core strengths of our business, the reoccurring revenue generated by our annualized titles, live services, and ongoing mobile business. While not guaranteed, this revenue is highly dependable and accounts for 60% to 70% of the total. For the next few years, we expect further improvements in gross margin, on the order of 100 basis points a year, through growing our digital business. In addition, we will continue to invest in new and existing IP and in new technology infrastructure to support our growing live services business. In marketing, we will continue to increase personalization and customization and leverage our player network to further improve efficiency and impact. These efforts will help us move operating margins from the mid-20% to the high 20% and continue to grow our earnings and cash flow power. In conclusion, fiscal 2015 we made considerable progress on our journey. We were able to massively grow earnings and cash generation. And we have built a solid and consistent business with a strong operational foundation that enables us to capitalize on the shift to digital content, the console cycle, and the growth of mobile. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Blake. We are entering a new global age for games, with a growing audience that spends more time playing games across more platforms than ever before. New consoles are being adopted faster than the last generation. Mobile continues its global expansion. New delivery and business models are poised to break through on consoles and PC, and there's huge innovation happening in game experiences across every platform. Players are at the center of this new era, and our focus is on building long-lasting relationships. As humans, we all need entertainment. For our players, we are delivering the best form of entertainment. Through amazing new games, dynamic and enduring live services, vibrant communities, and meaningful dialogue, we are enabling their passion for inspiration, immersion, competition, social connection, and fun. The passion we have for that opportunity, to lead this new age of gaming built around our global audience of players, is what will drive us in FY 2016 and beyond. With that, Blake, Peter, Frank, and I are here for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Go ahead, sir, your line is open. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks, good afternoon, congrats to each of you. I guess first off maybe for Blake, with all the progress and the success to date on managing expenses, I can only imagine that there's some pressure to invest more, given all the growth opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about the ability to keep expenses roughly flat, adjusting for the FX impact, and if that's a realistic expectation in future years? And then secondly, maybe Peter can add some color on the specific impact you're seeing on Ultimate Team on FIFA with the pricing changes and the transfer market resurgence. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So thanks, Colin. The first question on our guidance for OpEx, we're actually saying, as we said in the script, roughly $100 million of investment that we're making. It's flat because of obviously the FX impact on our international based investments. I think we're making substantial investments in new IP, in mobile IP, in our game engine to try to continue to expand cross-buy across multiple products and in our underlying infrastructure. We're continuing to focus on making marketing more efficient and effective by leveraging our digital connection with our consumers, and that will benefit us in our marketing expenses. But I guarantee we'll continue to support our brands in a fairly healthy way. I think we're making the right investments going forward and it will continue to help drive the top line of the business and the effectiveness of our products. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Colin, it's Peter. Just on Ultimate Team, as Blake said in his commentary, FIFA Ultimate Team expanded 40%, and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. So overall Ultimate Team grew 53%, and that's on top of the previous year when it grew 62%. As you know and you're aware when you track it, that we did put some measures in place, outlined by both Andrew and Blake, to look at some of the more nefarious actions that were going on. We continue to monitor that, keep a very close eye on what's going on, trying to balance the economy, keep some of the coin sellers out. But we have great optimism that our growth in Ultimate Team will continue going forward in FY 2016 and beyond. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks very much. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Colin. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, your line is open. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Obviously, a lot of anticipation into Star Wars. Can you give us any thoughts on how you've incorporated that into your guidance, how it might affect gross profit? And is there going to be a marketing benefit from that title given all the hype around the movie? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, we certainly hope that we can leverage a lot of the hype. We certainly have done that so far, and we've got a great partner in Disney and Lucasfilm on that. They're very excited for our title as well. For us, we're thinking about it with two bookends. One bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with we believe some upside obviously if things goes well. It is Gen-4-only and PC, and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title. It will put, as we said in the script, some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. We've been trying to target 100 basis points of gross margin improvement, and this year we're forecasting roughly 50 basis points, and much of that is due to the fact that there's a royalty on that to Disney. And at a level of 10 million units, that's a fairly large pressure on gross. So we're very optimistic and excited about the title. And obviously, the market has been the same way as the feedback we've seen from recently the Disney Celebration, where we showed the title for the first time. We'll obviously show it more at E3. And so everyone will get a chance to start to appreciate the depth and the excitement around it. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and congrats on the execution last year. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir, your line is open. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So, Andrew or Peter, some of your competitors showed off what I thought was a pretty interesting piece of technology, which allows streaming of game content from either the smartphone or the tablet onto the TV. So this obviously creates some interesting opportunities for you as a publisher to take stuff off the console. So is this an area of focus for you right now, or should we expect some of your less graphics-intense titles you're shipping currently with the console releases at some point in the future? And secondarily, how much data are you collecting from all of your users just broadly? And where do you think you are in terms of using that data to influence your content development? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, I'll take that, two great questions. One as it relates to streaming, streaming is a technology that's still in its infancy, I would say. Certainly, we have a few incubation efforts going on around the company to see how best we can benefit from that. But as you think about our core objective, which is to build more relationships with more players across more platforms around the world, streaming certainly represents an opportunity for us. Lots of work to go there in order to deliver the kinds of experiences we believe our players want to play, but certainly we have efforts going on. As it relates to data collection, we are collecting \u2013 I heard one stat once that we collect more data on a daily basis than the combined U.S. Library of Congress, which as you can imagine, is a lot of data. At a more core level, what we're starting to understand better about our players is how engagement works, how engagement works where a player engages on more than one platform, how engagement works where a player plays more than one franchise, and the effect of engagement over the long term as it relates to the likelihood that a player will continue and buy the next version of a title provided we can keep them playing over time. So there's a lot in our data right now as it relates to our players. We are using that data : one, to build better games; and, two, deliver more enhanced and extended and engaging experiences over time that keep them playing and entertained for longer. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Go ahead, your line is open. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. So just in the context of your guidance for 2016, Blake, I think you talked about 10% growth for the extra content business, and I think a lot of that might have been coming from FIFA Online in China. Can you quantify at all what you're expecting in terms of dollars for FIFA Online in China? Or maybe asked another way, do you think this could be bigger than FIFA Online in Korea? And then secondly on the Mobile business, I don't know if you can give out a margin for that business. But are you seeing stability in that margin or even improvement as you roll out this more branded IP? I imagine that relative to competitors, you might even have lower sales and marketing costs for mobile given that you are leveraging branded IP that has a built-in audience and I imagine would lower the cost of customer acquisition. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so let me start on FIFA Online 3 China, and then I'll have Frank address the mobile economics. On FIFA Online 3 China, as we said, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4 for that. We will start recognizing revenue in Q1, this quarter, which will include the revenue that we generated last year for that title. It will roughly be around $40 million this quarter. I think going forward for your models, I'd probably focus on $10 million to $15 million a quarter. And as that business grows, we'll keep you updated. We're very optimistic about it. Tencent has been very public around their optimism. But we remind people it's taken us three to four years to grow Korea to where it is today, and Korea is a more fluid market than China right now, and so it's probably going to take some time. Also, soccer is much more prevalent in Korea than it is in China, but it's growing fast in China, so we hope to follow that. So, it's a longer story for us, we think, but I think there's a lot of potential and everything is going very well. Frank, on the mobile? Frank D. Gibeau - Executive Vice President, EA Mobile, Electronic Arts, Inc.: The question on mobile I'll take. When we look at how Electronic Arts is constructing its mobile businesses, a couple of key competitive advantages that we're trying to harness. And the first is we have the broadest and most diverse and powerful portfolio of brands in the business, and that translates into very strong organic acquisition advantages. So pound for pound, people have heard of SimCity, The Sims, the products like FIFA and Madden. And organically they install at very high rates. If you looked at how SimCity did over the break, we were generating tens of millions of installs without really spending any money in paid acquisition. That's also combined with a really powerful network that we're designing. So it allows us to cross-promote and understand based on telemetry and data what our gamers are doing at any given time and what's the right message at the right time and what are the right games that we can put in front of them that might interest them. So the combination of a profound organic acquisition advantage coming from brand power and a network effect we believe will allow us from a long-term standpoint keep marketing and sales as a percentage of revenue very low, very low certainly relative to other mobile game companies. And as we look to grow the business, we'll continue to harness those advantages. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee CRT. Go ahead, your line is open. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Thank you and I'd like to add my congratulations, guys, a couple of quick ones. Just going back to the FIFA Online 3 China question, we got the revenue guidance. I would assume that most of that revenue comes in at pretty full margin. I'm wondering if you could maybe comment on that. And then you touched on EA Access. I'm wondering if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more how we should think about the adoption rates right now. What are some of the puts and takes there? And then lastly, Andrew, I would love to get your views on the overall market, the console market in particular, over the next couple of years. We see your breakdown of the physical versus digital revenue. I'm just wondering how you think about the progression over the next couple of years. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Arvind. On FIFA Online 3, we don't disclose obviously the profitability of the individual lines of business. But what you should assume there is Tencent is essentially delivering the product and doing much of the marketing in the local market. We're doing the product development and helping Tencent on any issues around hosting and delivering the product. So we obviously have product development costs. We don't have some of the marketing costs that you'd see in our normal business. So you should assume that it's good profit margins, but that's about as far as I can go on that. On EA Access, we're extremely pleased with the growth of EA Access. As I said on the call, we haven't really started to promote that with Microsoft. We will this summer. We've now added \u2013 we've got 12 titles in the vault. And that's why we feel like it's a great time to start to promote it because much of the value is around those titles in the vault. The subscriber base continues to grow. It's still not a meaningful part of our financials, and thus we're not calling out the actual numbers or the stats, but we will consider that in the future as we see how it grows. But overall, we're very interested in it and we're learning a great deal from the service around players' interest in subscription models and where they get the most value out of the service. I'll let Andrew catch the last one on consoles. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Overall, we're very happy with the speed at which this console generation has been taken up by players. As we talked about in the prepared notes, it's much faster than the last generation. We would expect close to 50 million consoles by the end of the year, and that's a meaningful install base for us to build games for. And the level of engagement we're seeing on a per-game basis is also very, very high, with people engaging in the live services that we're building around our games for much, much longer than before. As we think about retail versus full-game downloads, certainly we've seen growth in that area. It varies from geography to platform. But on a Gen-4 game like Battlefield Hardline, in the West we're seeing nearly 20% numbers, and we would expect that growth to continue. We've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010. And we believe the same forces that drove this in PC are at play on this latest generation of consoles. And so as bandwidth increases, lower-cost storage increases, we would expect continued growth in this area. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We always give this stat on every call. We're up 51% over the same period in Gen-4 versus Gen-3. So 17 months since launch the install base of Gen-4 consoles is now up 51% versus the same period for Gen-3. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Thanks, Peter. Thank you, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, good afternoon. Just to follow on regarding the full-game downloads, you mentioned 20% on games like Battlefield. Are you trying to accelerate that as fast as you can because it's better margin, or are there reasons to take it slowly? I guess in other words, are there risks to a rapid transition to full-game downloads, or are you just putting the pedal down on pushing that as fast as you can? And then secondly, regarding the pipeline, we noticed Titanfall is not in your announced title slate as of now. Does that mean that it won't ship in fiscal 2016, or does that mean that it may or may not ship in the year, but would currently be an unannounced title if it were a fiscal 2016 launch? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So first on full-game downloads, we're essentially allowing the consumer to vote. We would like the consumer to consume games where they want to consume them. And if that's in full-game downloads or if that's in retail, we want to be there. We've got great partners in retail. GameStop, Target, Walmart, Game (45:30), others are very powerful and helpful to us. And so we want to make sure we're delivering the experience in the way the consumers would like it. Obviously, it's better economically for us longer term to do digital, and we're focused on all the digital content, not just full games. And we see that that's the direction the industry is going, but we're not trying to do something unnatural to push it one way or the other. In terms of Titanfall, you should assume that that's not in fiscal 2016. It's more likely in fiscal 2017. And a title of that size, we want to be pretty clear as to when it's falling in the title slate, and so your assumption should be 2017. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel. Go ahead, your line is open. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just want to go back to FIFA. You guys talked about a lot of the puts and takes that will contribute to results in fiscal 2016. If you take a step back, you're comping against the World Cup last year. What are your expectations for the franchise maybe on a constant currency basis or a headline number? And then separately as it relates to Star Wars, you mentioned that you're going to be publishing on Gen-4 only. Is that a strategy you intend to employ across other franchises going forward? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, Drew, on FIFA, we expect continued growth in that franchise. Obviously, at the size that franchise is now, the law of large numbers makes big growth numbers difficult. But we've continually year in and year out been able to grow FIFA by improving the quality of the game, by adding extra additional services around the game like Ultimate Team, and driving into continued new geographies around the world. The popularity of football in America continues to grow, and that's been fueling the growth of the product here in the U.S., even though it's always been very strong internationally, and we think we'll continue to see that. So we're very optimistic about FIFA and we hope to see that continue to see upside growth, and that's what's built into our forecast. Your second question was... Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: As far as Star Wars is concerned... Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. So we will see a slow movement away from Gen-3. As a reminder, we've been making Gen-2 console games up until the last year or so. For some of our bigger franchises like our sports franchises, we'll continue to make Gen-3. But we're making some decisions on new franchises and titles to focus on Gen-4, partially because the power of the platform allows for exceptional gameplay and incredible graphics. And for something like Star Wars, we wanted to make sure that we provided the highest level of quality for the game experience, and you can do that only on Gen-4 and PC. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Go ahead, sir, your line is open. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, guys, congratulations again on the execution, a few questions for you. First, some very large companies seem to be focusing more and more on virtual reality. Can you talk a little bit how EA is working in that space? And are there meaningful investments there yet, or is it just still too early? And then, if you could, also just describe how FIFA is actually monetized in China, and remind us how the revenue recognition works. And then finally, Blake, I think you said the new $1 billion buyback anticipates returning about 50% of free cash, and then you guided FY 2016 to $1 billion. So does that mean that FY 2017 free cash should be flat with 2016? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Ben, I love how you do your math. I was not implying at all that 2017 free cash flow was going to be down. I was simply trying to help people understand how we're thinking about return of capital. The goal would be if we were to continue to be able to increase cash flow over time, we would continue to increase our buybacks over time, and we're thinking about that as a two-year program. As you can see, we started a two-year program a year ago, and we replaced that with a new two-year program this year. I'm not predicting what that's going to be for the future, but think about it more like a progression over time versus any guidance around fiscal 2017. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'm very optimistic about 2016 and 2017. So that's that piece. FIFA Online 3 is a free-to-play PC game, which means much like in Ultimate Team, you monetize based on collecting and trading players and playing with those players. You don't have to monetize. You can play the game for free. But like all free-to-play games, to build a better team, to get further ahead in the game, to win against your friends, you will possibly monetize to build that team. The revenue recognition issue was simply a one-time issue for us, and that was we were waiting for the formal rollout of the game in China with our partner Tencent. And that occurred in early April and thus the ability to start to recognize revenue. We did not want to recognize revenue until the game was fully functional, fully rolled out, moved from soft beta to hard beta to full rollout, and it had all the features available for gameplay, and that's why we now start to recognize. But we shouldn't have a recognition issue going forward on that. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sorry, I meant recognition. If a player spends a dollar in China, are you booking only the piece that you're getting from Tencent, or are you booking the full dollar? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, good question. Yes, we are. Much like we do with mobile, we only book net. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On virtual reality, again, I would say that this is a technology that has the potential to profoundly impact our industry over time. I think the notion of immersion as a key motivation that our players are looking to fulfill when they play our games is something that could certainly be well fulfilled through the notion of virtual reality technology. As a company with creative innovation as one of its core pillars, it's very important that we stay ahead of this. And as a result, we have some clear and focused investments in the space. As you will know if you follow this, there are a number of different potential providers and manifestations of virtual reality right now that go everywhere from wearing a pair of goggles to a holographic type experience, or to a room overall that you step into. We are looking at any and all of these things and have a few incubation efforts going on around the company so that as this begins to manifest itself, we are, as a creative and innovative company, able to lead from the front. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Go ahead, sir, your line is open. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter and year. Enjoy it, you guys have definitely deserved it here. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: A couple questions. I was curious on your capital allocation strategy as it relates to share repurchases and intensifying your effort there when your company's valuation is near an all-time high versus potentially accretive M&A opportunities, particularly as you begin to increase investment in new IP, as you outlined today. And then I have a follow-up. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so we look at a couple of components when we think about return of capital to shareholders. We first and foremost believe that that's a critical goal of the company is to continue to return capital to shareholders. We balance that with two things : one, our need for capital internally; and two, our onshore versus offshore balance of capital. Right now we have about 60% of our capital onshore. Our need for capital in terms of CapEx is roughly $100 million a year, as we've talked to. We have, obviously, our outstanding convert that we will either refinance or pay off over time. That's due next summer. And we believe even after that, we have plenty of capital to respond to any opportunities that come our way either on acquisitions or internal investment. We've got substantial debt capacity based on our performance and substantial onshore cash to be able to address \u2013 or offshore cash for international acquisitions to be able to address anything that comes along. But we're really focused on driving the business out of our existing IP or licensed IP. We see a huge future for the company with what we have today. And we feel like we want to make sure we're focused on that first and foremost before we run and chase other acquisitions. Doesn't mean we wouldn't do something, but we're very focused on the opportunities that we have today. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: All right, fair enough, Blake. Thank you. Last question, you had a few game delays last year, and obviously that happens. And ultimately, you seem to have crafted an advantage from the delay by providing a higher quality product. But curious on Star Wars, how confident you feel today on the development of this game and the anticipated quality as pacing within that desired launch window, seeing that the timing of this drop is perhaps more important given the launch of the movie in December and, as you noted, related marketing benefits hopefully from that. I'm also curious if you plan to have a beta or early release within your EA Access program. Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll let Andrew touch on the Star Wars question. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So again, as someone who grew up making games in this company, making games is hard, building fun is hard, and getting that right on a day is even harder. And what you saw over the past year was our commitment to players in building great properties and the willingness to make hard decisions around that. With that said, there are any number of things that might contribute to a miss or a need to move a date. As it relates to Star Wars Battlefront, I would say as it stands right now, we feel very, very good about the trajectory and the velocity of the development team. They're building on platforms now that have been in the marketplace for a number of years. They're building on the core engine that has launched a number of products, including Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age : Inquisition, all of which have been great properties. And they're a tried and tested development team who have a very, very clear focus and understanding of the type of game they're making. The game is fully playable. We released a gameplay trailer a couple of weeks ago at Celebration, but some of the inside community also got to see a fairly lengthy full gameplay demo, which is very, very exciting. We look forward to showing more of that at E3. But as it stands right now, we feel good about the trajectory and the velocity and our ability to ship that game at the appropriate time this year. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, best of luck. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean McGowan of Needham. Go ahead, sir, your line is open. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to circle back on a couple of things mentioned before for clarification. When you were talking about the estimated unit sales of Star Wars, I think you said 9 million to 10 million. Are you talking about in the fiscal year or over the life of the product? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : In the fiscal year of our guidance. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks. And I don't know if this would be for Peter or Andrew or Blake, anybody. You said you count a bundle as a physical sale and you're still getting 20% full-game downloads. What would that number look like if you counted that as a digital sale? Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Sean, it's Peter. That varies from quarter to quarter, year to year depending on the bundles. But I want to make it very clear that whether it's a code or a physical disk that goes into a bundle that is primarily put together by our first-party platform partners, that is physical media to us and that's how it's accounted for. Our full-game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at a 20%-plus for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases. So we're seeing the growth. And as Andrew said, if we stay on a path that's analogous to PC, that will continue to grow over the coming fiscal years. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. And then my last question was on the any variability around the June quarter. Considering that there are no major launches, it seems like this might be a quarter where there's not a lot of variance off of the guidance. Is that a fair way to look at it? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll let you guys look at history and decide that. Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, got to try. Thanks Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We try our best, guys, to give the best guidance as we can at the moment that we're giving it, so one last question. Operator : Our last question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the question, just a quick Star Wars follow-on. Just curious how DICE is really prepping to ensure the smooth launch of Battlefront, including not only gameplay but also things like connectivity and even various types of IP protection that might be in the works. Basically, are there any out of the ordinary aspects to the game that could cause an unforeseen delay? I know someone else was asking about a delayed timeframe. Just any additional color on out of the ordinary stuff would be great. Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary, I think we treat every game launch with security, stability, and scalability of paramount importance. Certainly as we talked about in the prepared comments, we learned a lot coming out of Battlefield 4. We've launched a number of very, very large-scale titles on our infrastructure since then and have performed very, very well by market standards. Dragon Age : Inquisition launched. Battlefield Hardline launched, so we've been making significant investment into our core infrastructure around security, stability, and scalability. Game teams have been making significant investments in terms of development process and QA around that. So while we can never foresee everything, we have demonstrated now that we've learned from some of the things that we've gone through over the past. And we don't expect anything unforeseen or different with respect to Star Wars than we have around our other giant titles. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : And the reason I ask is just going back to Spore with the DRM limitations back in the past that backfired. With a bigger IP title like this, that's the only reason I'm asking. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it's a good question, but we don't see anything at this time. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Great, thank you, everyone. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experiences for them. We're building deeper connections with players in our games and live services. There is tremendous excitement for our upcoming titles, and we see profound new energy in our industry. Our Q1 results were excellent, with revenue, margins, and earnings above our guidance. Our top games and live services, including EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, are engaging players around the world with fresh new experiences. We see continued strength in our mobile titles, with new games coming later this year. EA is executing well against our plans for FY 2016. And with ongoing strength in our digital business and growing anticipation for our upcoming titles, we are raising our full-year guidance today to reflect momentum across the portfolio. Our industry is hitting a powerful stride as we advance further into the new global era for games. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 installed base continues to grow and show great strength, driving well beyond adoption rates of previous generation devices. The opportunities in mobile as well as new service and delivery models are opening up more ways to bring players into our games than ever before. At the E3 conference in June, the appetite for great new games was clear. Players on all platforms are ready for new experiences that capture their imagination with creativity, innovation, and breakthrough gameplay. EA is in a strong position to deliver. We had an outstanding E3 this year, showcasing 15 new games to our players, media, and partners. Throughout the event, our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm was in full view. Star Wars Battlefront stunned audiences with the magnitude and realism of its gameplay. We revealed a new expansion for Star Wars : The Old Republic, and announced a new Star Wars mobile game. We unveiled new experiences for original IP with Mass Effect : Andromeda, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, and surprised with the unexpected charm of Unravel. We celebrated the return of Need for Speed, captivated players with the authenticity of our upcoming SPORTS games, and detailed the gameplay innovation in Mirror's Edge Catalyst. Attendees were able to go hands-on with all of this year's titles at our E3 booth. Most importantly, through content and social conversation, we brought the E3 experience to players around the world. Millions of viewers joined the stream of our live event, and our titles were mentioned more than 500 times per minute on social media during the week of E3. Trailers, gameplay, and live streams of our games were viewed over 53 million times throughout E3. And Star Wars Battlefront alone generated 22 million views on social platforms, our most popular content ever at E3. It was tremendous to see such positive reaction from players and feel the excitement level for our games continuing to build. We're looking forward to sharing more at gamescom in just a few days. In addition to our upcoming games, our live services today are ecosystems of ever-changing content for our players. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players logged a combined 170 million online gameplay hours in Q1, and we'll be bringing new expansion packs for both experiences in the coming months. The Sims 4 player community continues to grow and engage deeply with the game as we deliver more updates and new content, and we saw gameplay hours in our mobile hit, The Sims FreePlay, increase 85% year over year. In addition, our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes averaged over 2 million players per day in Q1, up nearly 20% year over year. Amazing and creative new experiences, dynamic live services, and deeply engaged communities built on strong and meaningful relationships with our players, these are the building blocks of our long-term strategy for Electronic Arts. Through our key franchises as well as experiences with new and original IP, we have the ability to reach more players than ever. EA Access, Origin, and our new Xfinity Games beta are bringing more players in to compete, connect, and fuel their passion for games. And with our digital infrastructure, analytics, and live services, we are evolving and personalizing the experience for each player and exploring how cross-game services can create additional value for everyone. After a strong first quarter, the stage is now set for us to deliver our slate of groundbreaking and stunning new games through the remainder of FY 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than the prior year's because we had no console launches this quarter, and the year-ago quarter included the launches of Titanfall for Xbox 360, EA SPORTS FIFA World Cup 2014, and EA SPORTS UFC. Our core business was strong. And at constant currency, this quarter's revenue would have been within 4% of last year's. As I discuss the results for this quarter, bear in mind that FX changes have had a dramatic impact on year-on-year comparisons. The euro, for example, fell nearly 20% against the dollar from the first quarter last year to this year's first quarter. In the first quarter, EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, and The Sims 4 drove solid revenues and delivered excellent margins. This demonstrates the power of our deep catalog of popular IP, which delivers a base of stable revenue throughout the year. The revenue and margin beat versus guidance were driven by better than expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 10% year over year to $532 million, 77% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing twelve-month digital net revenue was up 20% to $2.28 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $255 million, up 21% over the prior year. The principal driver of this growth was FIFA Online 3 in China. $31 million of the FIFA Online 3 revenue was deferred from previous quarters, as noted in our last earnings call. Total Ultimate Team was down 6% year on year but up 3% on a constant currency basis, even with the World Cup boosting FIFA Ultimate Team engagement levels last year. Mobile generated $122 million in the quarter. Digital extra content and advertising was up 11% versus the prior year to $115 million, while premium mobile full-game download revenue was just $7 million, down 56% compared to the prior year. We expect premium full-game download revenue to remain at this minimal level for the foreseeable future. Full-game PC and console downloads generated $84 million of revenue, up 18% over the prior year. We continue to see the digital downloads increase as a percentage of full-game sales, although this quarter was particularly high since our catalog titles typically skew more towards digital downloads than do newly launched games. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $71 million, down 11% from last year, due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to the Vault. Titanfall is now in the Vault and Dragon Age : Inquisition will join it at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.8%, an increase from last year's 70.2% and better than our guidance of 74.5%. Growth over the prior year was driven by product mix, the shift to digital, and FIFA Online 3 in China. We exceeded guidance largely through better than expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and the continued success of The Sims 4, which delivers very high margins by virtue of being a PC title based on wholly-owned IP. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $472 million, up $13 million or 3% year on year. The increase over last year was driven by R&D, payroll tax expenses related to stock-based compensation which have risen with the stock price, and by the extra week in the quarter. This was offset by FX and lower marketing costs as a result of no major launches this quarter. The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 a share, which is $0.15 better than guidance due to strong revenue and higher gross margin. As a reminder, this is calculated at our new tax rate of 22%. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.88 billion or approximately $9.23 per share. 64% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $71 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $992 million, a record for this period. During Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $132 million. Our $1 billion stock buyback program was initiated partway through Q1 in May 2015, and has a two-year timeframe. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $925 million left on the $1 billion plan, as some of the stock repurchased during the quarter was bought under the old plan. Due to the strength of our business, we are increasing our full-year guidance. For fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue is up by $50 million to $4.45 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS increases $0.10 to $2.85 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of 27%. It's still early in the year. And with Q1 representing less than 16% of expected full-year revenues, we believe some continued conservatism is appropriate. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.3 billion in revenue and $1.98 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the year, we are reiterating our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.15 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.05 billion. Guidance for our second quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. In addition, FX presents a year-on-year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 63%. Again, the main difference between this quarter and the year-ago quarter is the launch of The Sims 4. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $510 million, up slightly year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D, and offset by FX and savings in marketing. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.73 last year. Our Q2 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $815 million as compared to $990 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $0.58 as compared to a $0.01 per share profit in the prior year. We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Our ability to reliably generate earnings, even in the absence of major launches, is a testament to the value of our broad IP portfolio, our catalog, and our robust live services. Digital extra content and mobile continue to provide additional layers of consistent revenue. On top of this, player reactions to our marquee titles at E3 gives us great confidence in our competitive position as we look forward into this year and beyond. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Blake. We have a great deal ahead of us over the next three quarters as we prepare to deliver a range of new titles from our key franchises and original IP as well as more new content for players in our live services. We will have four more EA SPORTS experiences launching through the summer and fall, Madden NFL 16, NHL 16, FIFA 16, and NBA LIVE 16, all featuring engaging new modes and groundbreaking gameplay for our players. Need for Speed will arrive in November, and fans are loving the authentic car culture and deep customization that we've shown so far. And of course, Star Wars Battlefront will launch on November 17. The excitement for this game continues to build. It took home 45 awards from E3, including Game of the Show from IGN and Best Online Multiplayer from the E3 Game Critics. We look forward to unveiling new dimensions of Star Wars Battlefront and letting players go hands-on next week at gamescom. We have more new experiences coming throughout the year. Our live services will continue to evolve with new content. We'll have some great new mobile games, and we're excited to have three new and original IP titles launching in Q4. Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect : Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY 2017 and another new Star Wars project being led by the dynamic creative team of Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig. These are just a few of the new experiences in development across our studios today. From the creativity of our teams to the technologies we are building to the passion for play that we share with our players, we are pushing the boundaries for games in an effort to deliver the next amazing experience. Through our games and live services, we will immerse players in new worlds, introduce engaging new characters, and transport them into adventures that capture the imagination. In a new global age for games where more time is spent playing than ever before, we are also building a future with relationships at the core. Through our network, we are connecting players with each other and delivering experiences that are meaningful every time they play. I look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead. Now Blake, Peter, and I are here for your questions. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : All right, Kay, we're ready for questions now, thank you. Could we have the first question now, please? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Mr. Chris Merwin from Barclays. Sir, you may start with your question. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. So I just had one on gross margin. I think, Blake, you touched on some of this, but it's a very impressive margin that you posted. And I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what in particular drove that through a combination of, I guess, digital downloads, FIFA Online, and China, and then whatever else. And then just secondly in terms of Ultimate Team, I think you commented that it was up slightly on a constant currency basis but down on a reported basis. I know last quarter there was an illegal coin sell issue, and I know you're working to resolve that. I'm just curious where you stand as it relates to that, and then how we should be thinking about growth for Ultimate Team for the rest of the year in the context of your extra content revenue. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So first on gross margin, the gross margin, a couple things to remember in just year-over-year comparisons. One, last year both Titanfall and UFC are royalty bearing titles, so they have dampened last year's gross margin a little bit. But the real driver for us was the strength, as you noted, FIFA Online 3. Obviously, some of that is deferred revenue, so coming in at very nice gross margins. But second and probably more importantly, the strength of The Sims 4, and I'd just give people a reminder. Last year The Sims started a little slow relative to our thinking. We talked about that in our Q2 earnings. But the strength of The Sims franchise is the layering in of expansion packs that really fuel not just the expansion pack revenue, but bring people into the core game. And we were in a situation where many consumers were comparing the original Sims 4 game to The Sims 3 game with a long series of expansion packs. And as we now start to bring out expansion packs, they're starting to see the power of The Sims 4 gameplay and the excitement around it. And we sold more Sims 4 this quarter than we thought, and we think that trend will continue and we're very excited about it, not just because of the franchise, but because of the power that it drives to the gross margin. And then last but not least, as you saw, the digital business as a whole was 77% of our total revenue. And that included a large amount of full-game downloads, which obviously enhances margin, as well as all the other components of the digital business which enhanced our gross margin, and that really helped the over-delivery relative to plan. In terms of FIFA Ultimate Team, and I encourage Peter or Andrew to jump in on this if they'd like, first we saw, as you said, Ultimate Team down slightly but up on a constant currency basis. And a key reminder there is the comparison year over year was that FIFA Ultimate Team did extremely well in the first quarter last year because of the World Cup and all the people playing associated with the World Cup and the World Cup modes that we had in the game. We did see better performance of FIFA Ultimate Team than we expected. As you remember, in Q1 we \u2013 or last call, Q4 excuse me, we gave some warning that because of the illegitimate coin selling we thought that we would see some slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team mainly because the actions we take and the new price banding. Much of that will be corrected in the new version of FIFA Ultimate Team that comes out with FIFA 16, and we're excited about that. And we don't see any change to our outlook for the overall extra content and Ultimate Team business in the future. And as you can see, we were surprised that we did better than expected on Ultimate Team in the quarter, which also helped drive margin. There's a lot of excitement about soccer in the world. The Women's World Cup in Canada really drove a huge amount of excitement in North America. We're seeing a great amount of excitement across Asia. And we think that will continue to help drive both the FIFA product and the Ultimate Team product over time. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Mr. Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys, this is Ryan calling for Justin [Post]. First question is on OpEx. You've done a good job of managing those expenses the past several years, and the 2Q guidance shows some sequential growth there. Any color you can give on just where you are in terms of investing for the cycle and OpEx growth going forward? Second, Blake, can you just confirm whether or not Unravel was included in your prior outlook and just whether any of the guidance increase this quarter is due to unannounced or new titles or products? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, so let me hit OpEx first. The OpEx that we gave guidance on at the start of the year obviously hasn't changed in terms of the guidance. We have built into that OpEx R&D investment in both console and mobile products, and that's why you're seeing a slight uptick. The OpEx this quarter was driven primarily by the options \u2013 or RSU [Restricted Stock Unit] exercises and the tax expenses associated with those. We didn't forecast the stock price to be as high as it turned out to be, and thus it was a little bit higher than we had expected. It's still obviously within our guidance, and we're comfortable with our full-year guidance on OpEx. We're continuing to try to be extremely efficient in R&D and continue to try to build benefits in to drive marketing expenses around the great digital connection we have with our users, our gamers, and consumers out there, and you'll hopefully see continued benefit to that over time. In terms of the guidance and products, Unraveled was in the original guidance. I don't think the expectations around the love for Yarny himself was quite built into our guidance, and we were pleasantly surprised at E3 about how popular he was. But it's still a fairly small product and it's built into our guidance. We haven't added any products to our guidance. That was not the reason that we raised the number. The number was raised primarily due to the positive reception we saw across all of our products and the strength of the industry, as Andrew mentioned, the excitement we've seen around console gaming and the continued popularity of both Xbox and PlayStation and the strength of that going forward. So that was really the driver to our raised guidance. Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then one quick follow-up, if I could, on digital and mobile. There was a pretty sharp fall-off, but it looks like the smartphone portion of that mobile is doing well. Can you help us with the phasing of mobile throughout the year or any products that we should be aware of that are coming out on mobile in the near term? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We've talked about a couple of key products that are coming out in the back half of the year. I can't give you exact dates. We test our mobile products extensively, and so it's often hard to be able to guess exactly when the launch date is going to be. Clearly, we have the Minions as a key product. We have a Star Wars product coming out. We have updates to some of our sports titles which you'll see; and a lot of exciting expansions or additions to products like The Simpsons or SimCity BuildIt, which have continued to build off of the strength of our platform there. In terms of the actual phasing, hard to say, and I don't think it changes our overall phasing that we've put in our new guidance, but we'll update you as that comes along. Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks and nice quarter, guys. I have a couple of questions. First off, a lot of anticipation around Star Wars obviously and it looked really great at E3. Just considering the release date is fairly fixed, I wonder how comfortable or confident you are, Andrew, around the studio's ability to launch a fully finished product by the time November rolls around. And then are you sticking with the original 9 million to 10 million unit guidance for the game? Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Colin, and thanks for the congrats. We're feeling very good about the game right now. Again, as a reminder, this is a tried and true development team building on the Frostbite engine that's now launched a number of products on this platform generation, and we're coming on the third phase of development on this generation of products. So we feel like we have put all of the things in place that we need to, to deliver a great product. We had thousands of people play it at E3 in one of the more robust setups we've had for a shooter in our E3 booth in recent years, and we're looking at having literally tens or hundreds of thousands of people play it on over 200 units at gamescom next week. So the code is all very playable. The quality is high, and the feedback so far from the player base has been very positive. On the 9 million to 10 million, I'll let Blake take that one. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Just to clarify, there's no change obviously in ship date on that whatsoever. We're very confident that we should be able to hit that date based on what Andrew just told you. On the guidance, look, we normally do not raise guidance coming out of the first quarter. I think all of you know we have a fairly conservative mindset around guidance. This is the first time we've raised guidance in probably 10 or 15 years coming out of the first quarter because only 16% of our business is really booked in the first quarter. We're really excited about Battlefront but we're also really excited about all of our products, and that excitement drove us to increase our guidance in the quarter. We haven't yet started to think about or talk about publicly what that means in terms of units, partially because it's still early. We want to see how the reaction is at gamescom to all of our products, including Battlefront, as well as how the fall plays out. So I would assume we'll have that discussion in October before we ship those products, and more to come on that. But right now, think about the raise in guidance on revenue as strength across all of our products, including strength in the response around Battlefront. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, Blake, thanks, and just one quick one on the second quarter outlook versus a year ago. You mentioned the FX headwinds and sense for the comp there, but you also have the higher console installed base and digital growth, and I think NBA is incremental. So it would appear that top line growth is still a possibility on the strength of the franchises. But are there any other moving parts I'm missing that might have impacted your initial outlook? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No, and in fact, it looks like a lot of people on the Street got ahead in terms of revenue. And I think that's because maybe people forgot that The Sims was in last year's quarter along with the sports titles; obviously, no Sims this year. We're expecting strong revenue out of FIFA, Madden, NHL, and NBA, but those are obviously \u2013 they were there last year as well. I think the biggest and really only headwind comes out of FX. And based on where we are today and FX rates today, we think that's relatively roughly $100 million relative to last year. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right, thanks. So, Peter or Andrew, are you able to share some of the underlying user data for FIFA Online 3 in China, monthly active users, paying users, et cetera, if not at least a directional indicator on how this is ramping, and separately if you are able to look at your user base for FIFA in the U.S. and compare that versus Western Europe or even versus Korea where you think you are? And, Blake, I think at E3 you talked about the possibility for an annual release of a Star Wars game as you take advantage of your license here. So where are you in terms of deploying development talent to make that possible? Thanks. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : So the first question, Steve, on FIFA Online 3 as regards trends, this is of course published with our partners in Tencent there, so it's a little early. As you recall, we waited for soft launch. We're now in full commercial launch. We can probably share a lot more of that data in the next earnings call. As regards to your question in comparison to the West, obviously they're very different experiences. This is a free-to-play game. It's built on the Ultimate Team format, but is not a twitch-type game which a regular FIFA game obviously is. So from that perspective, I think the overriding similarities of soccer fans around the world, and Blake touched on this, we're riding high on soccer currently right now coming off the Women's World Cup and with the new domestic leagues all about to start within the last two weeks. So obviously, having that FIFA license for us and being able to deploy it across multiple geographies with multiple partners and in particular in the biggest geography in the world with a very strong partner in Tencent gives us a great opportunity. We brought forward the $31 million from the previous quarter into this quarter here. And as Blake had mentioned on the previous call, we're looking at somewhere in the region of about $10 million to $15 million per quarter as net revenue from our Tencent relationship. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And in terms of Star Wars, I don't think we've actually said that there's an annual Star Wars plan in place, but we do have a long-term contract with Disney. And we know Disney has plans for many Star Wars movies, and we're going to try to take advantage of the IP that are coming out of those movies. I do think what we have said is that our intention is to try over the next couple of years to have a first-person shooter as one of the core titles, this year obviously Star Wars Battlefront, next year another Battlefield title. And as Andrew said, we're working on some other Star Wars titles. Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig are working on a core title right now. We don't have the timetable yet to announce those, but trust that you will see multiple Star Wars titles both on console and PC as well as on mobile. We have at least one mobile title that's going to come out this year and we have more in the process as well. So lots to come on Star Wars, and you'll hear about that as we discuss our future guidance. We're very excited about the franchise and about our partnership. Stephen D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mr. Brian Pitz from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the question. Just to follow up on Star Wars, I'm curious what you're seeing out of pre-orders. I know you've had 20 million views on the trailer and a lot of marketing around it, but any comment on this translating into pre-orders on the title and maybe how those pre-orders could compare to the last Battlefield at this point? Then separately, an update on your console growth expectations; I know Sony just raised its expectations today for the year. I believe you were around 48 million to 49 million next-gen boxes by year end, any changes or updates? Thanks. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the pre-orders, we're seeing extremely strong pre-orders coming out of E3, as you might imagine. I will remind everybody on the call that more and more as we see digital start to take a hold with our consumers that pre-orders become less of a key indicator, key linear indicator as how we predict our business here. But as we came out of E3, and more importantly, as Andrew mentioned, as we come out from what I think will be a pivotal moment for Star Wars next week in Cologne, Germany when 265,000 consumers will descend on the Cologne Convention Center on Thursday, all of whom will be trying desperately to get their hands on this title, we expect to see tremendous response from that. I've seen the build, and the game looks very, very solid, and we're excited to be able to share that. As regards the question regarding installed base, yes, 49 million at the end of the calendar year, just some data on that. We're now 20 months in. And if we go like-for-like on the previous generation, we're up 44% installed base hardware versus where we were Xbox 360, PS3, et al. And our attach rate for software is slightly ahead as well. When correcting for full-game downloads, digital full-game downloads and hardware bundles, we're at 6.1% right now versus 5.9% in the same period in the previous generation. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And, Brian, we haven't fully digested the Sony announcement other than to say that it's hugely positive. Every time either Sony or Microsoft brings out information, it's been on the positive surprise upside. I think the NPD data showing the success of the Microsoft one-terabyte console as well as the continued strength in both Sony and Microsoft's product mix have been really strong. And a piece of that puzzle is if you were at E3, you saw the quality of software, not just ours, but the whole industry. And that bodes extremely well for generating interest in \u2013 if you're sitting on the fence today getting out and buying a new console, and we think that's going to do well over the next couple years. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, next question. Operator : The next one is coming from Drew Crum from Stifel. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So you guys had a pretty sizable beat on gross margin in the first quarter, but that does not seem to be flowing to your fiscal year guidance, and I wonder what the rationale behind that was. And then separately, as relates to your sports titles, obviously a lot of moving parts there. Any updated view in terms of directionally how those businesses or how those franchises will perform in aggregate in your fiscal 2016? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Why don't \u2013 let me take the gross margin question and let Andrew hit the sports question. I think the reality is it's a little bit of the law of math, right? We're able to raise our full-year guidance on the bottom line and the top line, but with a slight improvement in gross margin. But remember, third quarter gross margin gets somewhat impacted by the royalty bearing nature of Star Wars Battlefront. So net-net, we're seeing a positive trend in gross margin. But with only 16% of the year gone, math just doesn't drive the gross margin numbers that much even though we've got a $0.10 increase in EPS. I think the good news there is a slight improvement in gross margin, nowhere near what we saw in the first quarter, but just a slight improvement going forward bodes well for the earnings and the cash flow power in the business model. And that's why we're so focused on driving the digital side of our business because it's a huge value creator for us. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we think about our sports portfolio coming into Q2, again, as we have got more and more data on our player base, one of the greatest things that demonstrates the propensity to upgrade to the next version is continued engagement in the current version. We're seeing very, very strong engagement across the portfolio right now. And that, combined with a great feature set across our sports portfolio and the evolution and growing player base as a result of the growing console cycle, and increased follow-ship of sports like soccer around the world, we are very encouraged and excited by what our sports portfolio can do through this quarter; but not just that, as a result of the live services that we now build around our sports games, what it can do through this fiscal year and beyond. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it, okay, and just one last one. Blake, can you remind us what you're assuming in terms of FX detriment to the top line in fiscal 2016? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's a good question. Thanks, Drew, for asking. As a reminder, we said at the start of last quarter and it pretty much holds that our revenue forecast on a like-for-like basis, last year's FX rates was $4.65 billion. We thought FX would impact that by $250 million, and thus that led to the $4.4 billion revenue guide. So obviously, under the new guidance we're assuming $4.7 billion in revenue, the same FX impact, $250 million, thus $4.45 billion in adjusted post-FX revenue. And we present in our investor pack the FX rate. The reality is the euro is right about the same level as it was when we did our original guidance. We saw a little weakening in the dollar during the quarter, up to about $1.13 from $1.09, but that didn't last very long. It's back down around the $1.09 level. And the Great Britain pound, which is obviously a big driver for things like FIFA, we saw \u2013 the original guidance was $1.62. It's currently at $1.56, so a little bit of difference, but last year's full-year average was $1.49. So we're still seeing some movement, but it pencils out to be roughly around that same $250 million headwind. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : The next one is coming from Mr. Ben Schachter from Macquarie. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys. First, congratulations on just continued positive momentum, a few questions. One, how should we be thinking about Titanfall free-to-play in China and throughout Asia? Two, aside from FIFA in China, what are the other key drivers in China? And then you know I have to ask a question about virtual reality. So I know it's very, very early for VR, and it won't impact the financial model anytime soon. But should we expect you to work with some of the VR platform holders in terms of them helping fund and develop some showcase titles? And when should we expect the first VR game from EA? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I thought you were going to ask when should we expect the first VR earnings release. That wouldn't be pretty. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Ben, it's Peter. Just on your Titanfall question, as you saw announced a couple of days ago, yes, we've entered into a relationship with our partners at Nexon as well as of course the developer Respawn. Think of this as a classic free-to-play game there, but do not think of this as being particularly material to revenue. It's an interesting experiment in looking at that type of game and whether it plays in a free-to-play environment. We'll be interested to see the results. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As it relates to VR, as we've talked about, we're thinking about this on a couple of different levels. We certainly believe that VR represents an opportunity for our industry as you think about our players' motivation to immerse themselves in cool new worlds and explore new characters. It's less for us about any one particular device or piece of technology and more about how we abstract beyond that and ensure our core technology layer, our digital platform, and our core engine in Frostbite can facilitate virtual reality experiences irrespective of which device a consumer wants to use. Right now we have a number of different incubation projects across the company where we're looking at best-in-class new and innovative and creative ways for players to experience our games in a virtual reality environment. It's still very early days, but we feel we're investing appropriately to prepare for a time where that could provide a new and different and innovative way for our players to experience our games. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, and just anything other than FIFA, what are the other key drivers in China that we should be watching? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think FIFA is our biggest single driver, and I think there the biggest driver is continued growth in popularity of soccer, and that's a positive trend going on obviously around the world and particularly in places like China. You'll see additional new products come out that have similar approaches, being partner and using known IP that resonates well in the Chinese market, more to come there. But I think our real approach is to try to stay very focused and try to build great relationships with partners there to help drive the business. That's worked for us really well in Korea with our Nexon partnership, and we want to try to do the same thing with Tencent in China to really drive that business. Versus throw a lot of products into the market and hope something works, we're trying to be very, very focused. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, I'm looking forward to the VR game. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, next question. Operator : The next one is coming from Mr. Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company. Sir, you may begin. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys, great quarter. It's nice to see the guidance going higher too, that's awesome. Thanks for taking my question. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Mike. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: I think you touched on this. I'm going to hit it anyway. I'm just curious on your hiring of Jade and the building of her new Motive studio in Montreal. As you said in your prepared remarks, it sounds like her first project is working with Amy at Visceral, and it also sounds like she's overseeing that studio. I'm wondering if this was an original development direction you were planning. Or do you feel you needed additional expertise for this game's completion, Star Wars, that is rumored to be an open-world experience? And I also wanted to confirm. You touched on it, but confirm that this new R&D expense related to Motive was originally part of the $100 million or so that you announced previous quarter. And I have a quick follow-up. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll let Blake cover the expense. As it relates to the hiring of Jade, as an organization, as a creative organization, as an organization always looking for really strong, creative leaders, we are always hoping to be able to bring in the best and greatest creative leaders. Jade and Amy have had a relationship for a really long time. We've been working with Jade for some time about coming into our organization and doing this project and some other projects, quite frankly. And we're very, very excited by what we're going to be able to do on that front, both as it relates to the Star Wars project that you referenced, and I won't make any comments on the rumors in any way whatsoever. But we're excited to have Jade as part of our organization and really looking forward to what she and the team that she's going to be working with both here and at Motive in Montreal are going to be able to do. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And to your comment, Mike, on operating expenses, yes, it is contemplated in our current guidance. Our assumptions \u2013 we already have a team of people operating out of the Bioware Studios based in Montreal. It's been a great location for us, and Canada in general obviously has been a great development location for us across Edmonton, Montreal, and Vancouver. We would like to continue to build more talent in that marketplace. And there are some great people to be hired there, and that's always been in our expectations. The reality is it will take Jade some time to develop the IP ideas and develop the core team. That's not a lot of people up front, so it won't impact this year's guidance at all. And next year we'll start to build that out, but you'll hear more about that in next year's guidance. I don't see it as a major driver of IP expense or R&D expense over the near term because we'll simply redial where our balance is around the world and where we're investing. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Last question, also in your prepared remarks, and you added a little bit to it, but the 16 million matches of FIFA 15 played on average per day in Q1 obviously astonishing, and it shows the ongoing engagement for a game that's been on the market now almost a year. So when you think about evolving business models, it would seem that a subscription service for a game like FIFA could be a successful future model for you and I guess for the players too, given the consistency of their engagement. And so I was just hopeful you could \u2013 it's a little fringe of a question, I apologize, but I'm curious if you could provide any insight on the potential for subscription game models on console in the future. And obviously I'm not talking about EA Access. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Great question. I'll see if I can shed some light on how we think about this. There are really two core vectors as we think about this. The first is how do we build a live service that engages players day in day out, week in week out, and month in month out throughout the year? And how do we build that into a consistent and predictable engagement loop for our players and for our business? And I think what you're seeing with FIFA and our other properties, including Battlefield and Madden and NHL and others, is that we are successfully navigating that shift and really leading from the front in an industry to drive great engagement opportunities for our players. The second vector as we think about that is then what's the appropriate business model for any given player to enjoy that experience? And I think it's insightful that you point out that it does open up subscription opportunity. As it relates to subscription right now, we are very happy with the testing and experimentation and analysis we've got going on with EA Access. And over time we will evaluate based on this ongoing engagement and relationship and conversation we have with our players as to whether the extension of EA Access as a subscription or some alternative subscription would make sense for that player base. But right now our focus is on the continuance and driving of that live service experience. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, best of luck. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Your next question, sir, is coming from Mr. Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question, two things for you guys. First with the news of consoles expanding in China beyond the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, what would it take for consoles, do you think, to actually gain traction in China changing from a massive PC environment to one that's more accepted with consoles? Secondly, big change of thought here, the convert that you have comes due in a year. I know you've got a hedge on that convert. But can you talk a little bit about can you use cash rather than delivering shares? How does the hedge impact the P&L when that convert eventually comes due? Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the China piece and let Blake deal with the convert. China, as you know, is a very interesting, diverse, and dynamic marketplace, particularly for Western companies. In order for consoles to be supremely successful there, I think that we would have to account for the cultural sensibilities of the Chinese game-playing population. We'd have to think about business model, we have to think about appropriate culturalized content, and the ability to fulfill the motivations that they have for social connection and competition, which differs from how we play in the West or even in other Asian markets. I believe that both Sony and Microsoft are committed to driving the business there. I feel that we have content that, should we be able to navigate through those key elements, has appeal in China. But my sense is that it takes some time, as has the overall market in China, to really gain the traction and momentum that it has today. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : On the convert, Eric, so a couple things to note, so original value of the convert roughly $633 million; that has to be settled in cash, and then the upside component of that obviously settled in stock. Right now, at the average stock price for the quarter, which was $61.61, that would equal 6.6 million shares of stock that would be used to obviously settle the convert. We published a chart on our website, our IR website, that shows that at various stock levels, so I would consult that and note there's a difference between the GAAP share count and the non-GAAP share count because GAAP accounting excludes the benefit of the bond hedge, so it shows full dilution versus what comes in through the bond hedge, where the non-GAAP share count is obviously unaffected by it. A couple of notes, as many people see with converts, particularly ones that are well in the money like ours, there often is early conversion requests that come in. And shortly after the last coupon payment, we saw a jump in early conversion requests. I believe people are simply making a calculation as do they take their money now or borrow money to carry it for the rest of the year. And typically the borrowing cost is offset \u2013 not fully offset by the coupon, and so you're seeing some early conversions. And we've had over $165 million of early conversions that will get paid out over the next three months; there's a time lapse. And so our assumption is we'll continue to see some of that over the next year as people get closer to the conversion date next July. Our intention is to look through ways to obviously potentially refinance that in the capital structure. We've talked about a potential permanent layer of debt or another convert and/or just paying it all off, and we're looking through all those options and more to come. But we appreciate the fact that there will be a lot of dilution and we're looking at ways to minimize that dilution going forward. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you very much, very helpful. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Mr. Ryan Gee from Bank of America. Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi again, thanks for taking my question. Blake, real quick, one of the comments you made is that the increase in OpEx year over year was due to, among other things, an extra week in the quarter. Can you just explain that? It seems like it's like for like this year and if that had any impact on revenue, not just on OpEx. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Obviously, it had a little bit of impact on revenue, particularly catalog revenue. It didn't have a big impact just because it wasn't like we were releasing a title in the quarter, but OpEx is obviously very steady where revenue is going to be up and down day to day or week to week. So I don't have the actual revenue impact, but we simply mention it because our internal accounting calendar had an extra week in the quarter versus last week, and that's why we mentioned it because it does drive a week's worth of extra OpEx. That would probably be the smaller portion. The RSU expense was obviously higher than that in terms of magnitude across the OpEx impact. Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next one is coming from Mr. Doug Creutz from Cowen & Co. Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: To follow up on an earlier question, you mentioned that the attach rates for the cycle are slightly up and that obviously the hardware installed base is growing much faster. Can you comment on how the performance of last gen compares to last cycle and on net between the two where you see things? Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Doug, it's Peter, so just let me say again. When we look at this cycle, let's call this current gen Xbox One, PS4, et al, versus last gen, we believe the installed base of hardware at the end of 2015 will be 49 million. On a like-to-like basis of 20 months, 20 months from the launch of the Xbox 360 and PS3 to where we are today, we are up 44% in the West on installed base. As regards the attach rate of software to the current installed base, 6.1% right now versus 5.9% of the previous generation. And that has been like-for-like indexed against the full-game downloads that we now enjoy both in the previous generation at the back end as well as the full generation we have now of full-game downloads as well as hardware bundles where the software has been inserted into the hardware. So 6.1% right now versus 5.9% taking into account digital downloads and bundles. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I guess let me add to that. We saw at the tail end of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 cycle full-game downloads around the 5% level. And that was 5% across new and catalog products. We're seeing today, if you look at our last front-line title that came out, Battlefield Hardline, both in last quarter and this quarter, we're seeing rates north of 20% full-game downloads. And if you look at our catalogs, we're seeing some catalog titles up into the 40% that are older titles in the year versus brand-new titles. All of those trends continue to see positive movements, and we've heard similar things from our other members in our industry. And so we're very, very excited about the potential for continuing to drive that part of the business. Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess maybe I didn't ask the question very well. What I was actually trying to get at is what you're seeing in terms of performance of Xbox 360 and PS3 compared to the original Xbox and PS2 at the end of the last cycle and the net. Obviously, we've had faster growth in the new gen, but my sense is the old gen is falling off faster as well. What does it look like on net compared to last cycle? Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : So it's how the tail is holding up, Doug, yes? Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's fair to say it's hanging in there. I think when you look at EA in particular, we keep our sports titles for as long as we possibly can. I'll remind you that's it's only three years ago we were shipping a PS2 title for FIFA. But I think it's fair to say as well when you look at our most recent big AAA launch, which was Battlefield Hardline, we saw four out of every five units on current gen. and as a result you're seeing most of our new launches now being on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. Whilst we'll still give some support in particular sports to Xbox 360 and PS3 and hope that they continue a trend of hanging in there, our dev teams in particular are moving forward with the next gen. Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Doug. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : With that, I think we'll call the call to a close. We appreciate everybody's time and continued support, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : And that's it for today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. Q2 FY 2016 was a strong quarter for Electronic Arts, as we delivered new EA SPORTS experiences and dynamic live services for our players. Revenue, margin, and earnings were above our guidance, and we are raising our full-year outlook to reflect continuing strength in our business and excitement for our upcoming titles, including Star Wars Battlefront. To understand how Electronic Arts is delivering for our players today, we look at player engagement in our games and services. We see our opportunity along three key vectors : bringing in more players to experience our games and services; enabling them to spend more time with the games they love; and making it possible to connect through more platforms and delivery models. Time is the most valuable commodity we have in today's digital world. With every new game, every update in our live services, and every community interaction, we are focused on delivering more value for our players through deep and personal engagement. Highlights from our second quarter demonstrate how more players are spending more time on more platforms in our games today. Monthly average players increased 30% year over year across our annual EA SPORTS franchises that launched new titles in Q2, Madden NFL 16, NHL 16, and FIFA 16. Our live services for Battlefield Hardline and Battlefield 4 are thriving many months after launch, with more than 6 million monthly average players across the two experiences. Madden NFL Mobile launched a full-game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year. And last but not least, EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last two quarters. We've added five new games to The Vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service. These titles and live services as well as many more in our portfolio are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season. Looking ahead, they will be joined in Q3 by two of our most exciting and groundbreaking new experiences. First, the return of Need for Speed is here, with players able to join a trial via EA Access today, and launching for everyone on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 beginning November 3. Excitement in the community has been growing as fans learn more about the cars, customization, and unique stories in the game. The game looks fantastic. And after a closed beta conducted earlier in October, the Ghost Games team has been working directly with community feedback to deliver the experience our players want. With more than 70 different customization categories and twice the amount of road to race as our previous game, the passion for speed and car culture will be unleashed in the new Need for Speed. Starting in just nineteen days, the galaxy far, far away will once again be at the center of our universe, as Star Wars Battlefront launches around the world. Engagement in and around the record-breaking beta was huge, with more than 9.5 million players logging on to play, 19 million viewers tuning into video streams, and almost three mentions per second on social networks during the beta week. Stability and scalability of our online services continues to be a top focus for us. In addition to our extensive internal testing, the millions of gameplay hours logged during the beta across multiplayer, single-player, and co-op modes further tested our infrastructure to help prepare a stable experience for our players at launch and beyond. Over the next few weeks, innovative new experiences will allow players to connect and learn more about Star Wars Battlefront. Our most avid Star Wars Battlefront fans can sign up for free to receive exclusive content and advance access to new information about the game. Through the largest-ever user-generated content program we've ever launched, awesome and inspiring moments from the game will be shared with millions in the player community. And a fully-immersive web experience will put fans right into the world of Star Wars Battlefront. Through it all, our integration with the upcoming film will ensure we're fully connected to the rising passion for Star Wars that is captivating the world. Come join us in Star Wars Battlefront beginning November 17, or November 12 for EA Access members. As we continue our focus on putting players first at Electronic Arts, we strive for quality and innovation in every experience. In addition to stability, security, and availability, we are taking creative leaps to make each game memorable and fun. We'll always work to take the necessary time to get the combination right for our players, and earlier this afternoon we announced that we are shifting Mirror's Edge Catalyst's release to May 24, 2016. We're going to take a few additional months to make the City of Glass and the unique first-person action in Mirror's Edge Catalyst even more spectacular. With players spending more time in our games and live services and two stunning new experiences launching this quarter, we're looking forward to the holiday season and the remainder of the fiscal year for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million, or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, on a constant currency basis, revenue would have been 3% greater than last year's thanks to strong launches of our EA SPORTS titles, led by FIFA 16 and Madden NFL 16 and from their associated Ultimate Team Live Services. As well as front-line success, we saw ongoing strength from our catalog, particularly The Sims 4 and Battlefield. In addition to our strong performance, this quarter's revenue includes a $30 million benefit from the recognition of some revenue from special editions of sports games sold in the quarter. It relates to Ultimate Team content included in these versions we had originally forecast to recognize in Q3. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 6% year over year to $480 million, 42% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 15% to a record $2.31 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $195 million, up 27% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team across our sports franchises. In addition to the strength of these live services, we benefited from an extra week of FIFA 16 sales in the quarter compared to last year. The new games modes we added to Madden NFL 16 and FIFA 16 are proving effective in deepening engagement. In addition, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title for China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. Mobile generated $113 million in the quarter. The free-to-download component was up 2%, or 9% up at constant currency. During the quarter, we launched Need for Speed No Limits, EA SPORTS FIFA 16 Ultimate Team, and a full-game update of Madden NFL Mobile. Madden has been a top-five grossing game in the U.S. on the iPhone Apple App Store in October. These new titles together with the just-launched Minions Paradise, the upcoming Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and our existing live services will help continue to grow our mobile business. Full-game PC and console downloads generated $89 million of revenue, down 5% over the prior year, due in part to FX. At constant currency, this revenue would have increased, as the growth in console downloads more than offset the absence of The Sims 4 this year. Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full-game downloads with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower due to strong retail sales in Europe. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $83 million, down 9% from last year, due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 premium revenues. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth. And finally with regards to subscriptions, we launched a major expansion for Star Wars : The Old Republic on Tuesday. Subscriptions are up 31% since the expansion was announced, to their highest level since February 2014. We're optimistic about its continued performance in terms of both subscribers and free-to-play in the run-up to the first new Star Wars movie in a decade. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 65.4%, a decrease from last year's 66.1%, but above our guidance of 63%. Last year's Q2 gross margin was exceptionally strong due to The Sims 4. About 100 basis points of the margin outperformance this quarter was driven by the $30 million in high-margin revenue mentioned earlier. A stronger than expected product and service mix also drove margins above our guidance. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $479 million, down $18 million year on year, driven by FX. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up approximately $16 million, chiefly driven by increased investment in R&D. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which is $0.25 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance, continued cost management, and the revenue phasing described earlier. At constant currency, EPS would have grown over last year. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.59 billion, or approximately $8.32 per share. Fifty-seven percent of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 64% held onshore last quarter, the difference being driven by the redemptions of our convertible notes and stock repurchases. During Q2 we settled close to $200 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. And as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $95 million to settle in Q3. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $798 million in our two-year, $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $9 million. Operating cash flow was down $174 million from last year as a result of fewer launches in Q1 of this year compared to last, and also due to the timing of various items. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $818 million. Turning to guidance, due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full-year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017. And remember that the $30 million of the beat in this quarter was already in our annual outlook as part of our anticipated Q3 revenue. Our new full-year guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $4.5 billion, up $50 million on our prior outlook. Our guidance for non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.15 to $3.00 per share. We anticipate an operating margin of approximately 28%. Since the start of the fiscal year, we've raised guidance by $100 million on revenue and by $0.25 on earnings. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.4 billion in revenue and $2.32 of fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.1 billion. Guidance for our third quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.78 billion, 24% higher than last year's. Growth is driven by the launches of Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed plus the growth of live services, particularly Ultimate Team. FX presents a year-on-year headwind of around $110 million to Q3 revenues. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 71.5%. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $540 million, up slightly year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D and phasing from Q2, offset by FX. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 per share as compared to $1.22 last year. Our Q3 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be a loss of $0.17 as compared to earnings of $0.44 last year. Our business exceeded our expectations again this quarter. FIFA 16 in particular had a very successful launch, as measured both by number of unit sales and by engagement levels. This has provided a solid foundation upon which to grow our live services through the product cycle. Reception of the Star Wars Battlefront beta has led us to increase our unit forecast, and early indications for Need for Speed are excellent. The growth of our console installed base and powerful mobile devices continue to fuel the growth of our business. We're looking forward to an excellent holiday season and another year of strong earnings and cash flow growth. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Blake. Around the world, billions of hours a week are spent playing video games. No matter what device you're playing on, what type of experience you seek, or where you are in the world, games are becoming a more meaningful part of our lives. The opportunity to connect more people to amazing experiences and to each other through play has never been more profound. At Electronic Arts, we are focused on delivering more stunning games and groundbreaking services that will inspire the world to play together : epic fantasies like Star Wars Battlefront that span generations of fans; EA SPORTS experiences that unite millions of passionate players; mobile titles like Need for Speed No Limits, SimCity BuildIt, and Madden NFL Mobile that can immerse you no matter where you are or how much time you have; and services like EA Access and Origin that are helping players try more games and share the play experience with friends. It's been a strong first half of FY 2016 for Electronic Arts, and we have amazing opportunities still ahead of us. The games and services we are delivering represent EA's greatest strengths, pioneering, creativity, and passion, channeled into experiences that will inspire play for a long time to come. We're excited for the road ahead. Now Blake, Peter, and I are here for your questions. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Kay, if you could, open up the line for questions now, please. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from Chris Merwin from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: You obviously continue to make a lot of progress on the margin front, and you're at slightly more than 50% digital as of last fiscal year. So as that shift continues, can you just update us on what the long-term margin target for the business looks like just in terms of non-GAAP operating income? And then secondly, extra content sales growth reaccelerated really nicely in 2Q, and I think you mentioned that the new launch of FIFA 16 and FIFA Online 3 were drivers there. So should we expect the momentum to continue there through year end? And what are you implicitly including in your guidance just in terms of extra content for the full year? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, so this is Blake. In terms of the longer-term targets, we haven't really given detailed long-term targets. What we have told people is if we continue on the same pace of digital growth as we've seen over the last couple of years, we should be able to generate at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion each year. Historically, it's exceeded that level, but I think at a minimum we should be able to see that. If you combine that with control around our operating expenses and continued movement towards more digital marketing, we should be able to see earnings growth. And our target is to try to get to earnings growth at least above 10% or greater, closer to 15% on a yearly basis if we can. That's obviously general targets. We'll give you detailed guidance for FY 2017 at the end of the year. And to the extent that we have an update on that, we'll let you know. But we continue to be excited, obviously, about where the business and the potential is. In terms of FIFA, the guidance for extra content and Ultimate Team in general, the guidance for extra content that we originally gave for the full year was around 10% growth of extra content. We've been exceeding that, and we hope that we can continue to hit that target or beat that target over time. We're very excited about the continued engagement levels that people are showing in all of our sports titles around extra content as well as the potential for extra content in other places in our portfolio. As far as FIFA Online 3 goes, in China we had originally given guidance that that should be around $10 million to $15 million a quarter, and we're seeing that level, and we're pretty comfortable as that continues to grow over time. Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. Blake, you just raised your Star Wars unit guidance. I think you gave the overall revenue phasing guidance in the slide deck. But what's embedded in your guidance for how Star Wars will be phasing between your third and the fourth quarters? And also secondarily, I think you mentioned 20% digital download. How far behind is the European consumer in terms of full-game download adoption on the console? And are you seeing that uptake curve I guess follow in a similar path as what you've already seen in the U.S.? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Stephen, good questions. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but you should assume that a fairly large portion of the original sell-in comes in the third quarter. And then depending on how that does through the Christmas season, we'll see the rest in the fourth quarter, so roughly probably 75 :25. In terms of the full-game downloads, a couple things to remember; we still sell Gen-3 products, and Gen-3 products are typically doing full-game downloads at a much lower level. And then second, our business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily towards Europe, and two factors bring down full-game downloads today in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries. And two is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store, and they like a physical copy to help do that. We're seeing very strong full-game downloads continue in North America. And as a reminder, the PC business that we have, we see full-game downloads there roughly 75%. And so there's still a lot of headroom we believe in the full-game download opportunity for us going forward. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : The next one is coming from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird. Benjamin C. Gaither - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, it's actually Ben on for Colin. I just had two questions, more strategically. Could you talk a little bit about your e-sports initiatives and going forward whether you might have the rights from sports leagues to pursue some more formal tournament play? And then secondly, are there any plans for annual sequels or franchise extensions for Star Wars, or do the cadence of those look more like Battlefield or Titanfall? Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Ben, I'll take the first question \u2013 it's Peter \u2013 regarding e-sports. I want to remind everybody on the call that EA has been doing e-sports, and it's been a fundamental part of the way we've engaged with our consumers for over a decade, beginning with the FIFA Interactive World Cup. We've partnered in particular with FIFA, with all of the individual leagues around the world, with tournaments, and have been doing that for a number of years now. So from the perspective of our e-sports strategy, it's well formed at an executional level. When we think about partnering with the sports leagues themselves, we have those conversations. And whilst we've got nothing to announce yet, stay tuned because I think there's a lot of energy around this right now. We're obviously a very important part of that. Our IP has been used by many of the e-sports leagues to be able to drive their business, and we fully intend to be part of this going forward here. No real announcements yet at a higher level, but please rest assured it's very high on our radar. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And this is Andrew. To the second question around Star Wars and annualization, again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship. In terms of annualizing that in any particular way, we've made no announcements on that. And certainly what we're always looking at as we think across our portfolio is where there's an added opportunity for engagement. What we talked about in the prepared remarks is we still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. And it's important as we think about our business not just as a launch business, but as a large service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. So more to come on that in the future, but certainly expect more Star Wars titles from us, but no decision made as to specific timing as yet. Benjamin C. Gaither - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you, that's helpful. Operator : Next is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes, hi. This is Ryan Gee on for Justin. Thanks for taking my questions. The first is about Star Wars. Can you guys talk a little bit about the gross margin structure, what you can, for Star Wars relative to owned IP like Battlefield or even licensed products like FIFA or Madden? And going back to the digital downloads, you're averaging around 20% for this quarter. Is there any reason to expect that Star Wars could be higher or lower than that number? And then second... Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, sorry. Sorry, Ryan, go ahead. Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: No, go ahead. I'll follow up on FIFA in a second. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. So on the gross margin structure, I think we've told people that the license with Disney is a fairly typical royalty license. And most of our royalty licenses are in the high single digits or low double digits, and assume that the Disney license is there. What we try to do is offset some of that cost by lowering our marketing expense, and clearly leveraging the strength of all the activities out there around Star Wars is allowing us to do that. And you'll see a lot of joint marketing between us and Disney as well as us and Sony to try to leverage our partners to be able to offset some of that. It will impact gross margins slightly, as you've seen in our guidance for the quarter, but we don't see it as a big issue for the overall profitability of the company. On the full-game download side, the one caveat I would add there is normally it shouldn't really differ dramatically from any other title, with the one exception is it could be a title that's a heavy gifting title in the quarter, just because Star Wars is at the top of the list of many kids and teens out there what they want for Christmas. And gifting titles tend to be more physical versus a code, and so you might tend to see that. That could be, though, counterbalanced by the fact that we'll see another 10 million to 15 million new consoles sold in the next two months, in the Christmas time. And many of those people may choose to download digitally, particularly if they're the larger storage consoles. What was your second part of your question? Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, great. That was great feedback. The second is on FIFA and really the sports catalog. It is encouraging to see the 30% player growth. Is there any reason to expect Ultimate Team to not also be up 30%? Is there anything you can call out either this year or last year that would make that be up or down? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We were cautious at the tail end of last year because we had some issues with coin farmers. We've adjusted the new FIFA Ultimate Team to try to prevent those issues. It's a constant battle. That would be our only caution going forward. So far, we haven't seen any impact from that. What we are seeing is increased interest in Ultimate Team. We put in both FIFA and Madden this year a draft mode, which was essentially a way to help people understand how Ultimate Team works and how drafting and building a team works. And we're finding that that increases the engagement and increases the interest in entering into Ultimate Team. And so our hope is to continue to try to build that business across all of our sports franchises. And so far, things are going very well. Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next one is coming from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Sir, you may begin. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the questions. The 9.5 million beta players on Star Wars, what is the overlap audience with the 6 million still playing Battlefield 4 and Hardline? Is Star Wars essentially bringing new gamers into the Battlefield type of game? And also, any updates on preorders, including the $50 DLC season pass? I'd love to hear how the DLC attach rates compare to prior Battlefield releases. Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the first part on the 9.5 million. I don't have the data on hand. Anecdotally, what we have seen is that Star Wars is bringing in two groups that are very important groups to us. One are gamers that have lapsed, traditionally who have been big gamers in the past and maybe haven't played for a while, and it's certainly been a catalyst for those people to come back into the gaming universe as it relates to console. And two, onboarding a new younger age demographic. And so as we think about that 9.5 million, while there's absolutely a crossover around our core shooter category that we have very good and strong relationships with, we're very energized by the opportunity to bring in, one, that lapsed gaming group, as well as adding a new younger demographic going forward. And remember that this is a title, a shooter title that will be more appropriate for younger players than maybe some other shooter titles in the market. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : On preorders, I think when you look back, and you've heard from both Blake and Andrew how powerful this beta was for us, and that certainly spurred tremendous preorder growth. Every week subsequent to the beta, we had 9.5 million users who logged in 1.6 billion minutes of gameplay. On top of that, we were very fortunate, obviously, that The Force Awakens movie trailer came right on top of that, and that's allowed us to be able to generate even more publicity for the game as people start to anticipate the movie in mid-December. You combine that with all the engagement that our players have creating content themselves, a lot of user-generated content with millions of hours now of gameplay coming out of the beta on YouTube and Twitch. Now if Han Solo was here, we'd say great but, \"Don't get cocky, kid.\" Our ability to be able to deliver against this is solid and the preorders are excellent, so you've heard from both Blake and Andrew. We feel very good about 13 million units. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Was there another question? Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Battlefront season pass. As we've seen with Battlefield with Battlefield Premium, our ability to extend, and as you've seen, with 6 million people still engaged with both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Premium, is key. The engagement numbers \u2013 and we see a season pass as integral to that. What we've announced is four extra packs over the next 12 to 18 months coming post-launch. And from our ability, to be very clear, that's FY 2017 revenue for most of it. You'll see both new universes. You're going to see new player actions, obviously new weaponry as well. We think that added engagement and we think the ability for us to be able to deliver against what we need to be able to do from a season pass increases the engagement, and a very important part of keeping the content fresh and our players engaged. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : The next one is coming from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee CRT. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to congratulate you guys on another great quarter. I wanted to ask a couple questions. One is, Blake, if you could, maybe talk a little bit more about the $30 million revenue benefit, maybe some clarification there. I think I heard you say it was already part of the guidance. And then, Andrew, just your thoughts on virtual reality, any update there now that we have a little bit more clarity in the marketplace? And then one last one, can you maybe talk about Need for Speed, how the beta, what is the size of the beta and the unit expectations versus the last one? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, Arvind, first on the $30 million, when we planned our guidance, essentially we sell special editions of some of the sports games, FIFA and Madden, for example. And part of those special editions include Ultimate Team currency, and we decide how to defer that over time in conjunction with our internal accounting team and our external auditors. As we got into the quarter, we determined that some of the content we thought we would defer, we actually didn't defer. We were able to book it in this quarter. And we wanted to be transparent on that so people : one, understood one of the sources of our over-delivery; and two, understood that that was just shifting between two quarters. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Arvind. On VR, our position hasn't changed on that at this juncture. Again, what we have said in the past is that \u2013 and I personally am very bullish on VR and believe it will be an integral part of our industry and our business on a go-forward basis. As we think about what players are trying to do, which is immerse themselves inside these wonderful worlds and experiences that we create, and that it overcomes the social disconnect created by sitting 10 feet or three feet or one foot from a screen. With that said, we don't expect it will have a material revenue impact in the near future. We still think there is work to be done to get to a point where this is really a mass market consumer proposition that delivers great VR immersive experiences for a mass community. But at the same time, we are investing heavily in ensuring our Frostbite engine has all of the capability to deliver spectacular VR experiences, so we are well positioned as this market develops. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Arvind, this is Peter. On the Need for Speed beta, very successful for us. As I think most of you on the call know, Need for Speed now is available to play if you're an EA Access member as of today. The team, as it always does with a beta, use the beta results to tweak and do some last-minute polishing to the game. Every indication \u2013 and preorders are very strong around the world, every indication this will be yet another successful launch, having been two years away from consumers, as we see the numbers coming in, in the final few days here for next week. So Need for Speed goes live next Tuesday in the United States and Canada, and at the end of the week in the rest of the world. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Great, thank you and good luck. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Arvind. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : Next one is coming from Drew Crum of Stifel. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you remind us what the incremental FX hit is for fiscal 2016 now, and what the revenue foregone is from the shift of Mirror's Edge? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So roughly, Mirror's Edge, you should think about it as a $70 million-ish title for that quarter, so moving out of the fourth quarter. And our original FX guidance was roughly $250 million \u2013 or $290 million. Originally it was $250 million, and we think it's probably closer to $300 million now. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, good. And then any launch metrics aside from the mobile performance for Madden that you can offer, and any commentary around the full-game download performance of that franchise? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : In terms of the Madden franchise, you mean? Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, Madden NFL 16. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : It's been pretty consistent. Obviously, it's a dominant North America title relative to FIFA, and so we tend to see higher full-game downloads on Madden than we have with FIFA globally, for the fact that I mentioned earlier. And so you're seeing north of 20% on Madden obviously. And as the season goes on, we find that the initial purchasers tend to be the people who line up at the retail stores at midnight with their football jerseys on. Obviously, that skews the early days of Madden. But by mid-season we tend to see levels creeping up closer to 40%, at least based on last year's data. We don't know yet this year, but a strong focus on that. And the strength of Ultimate Team with Madden was very powerful last year. I think that draws more and more people into digital purchases as part of that ongoing gameplay. Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next one is coming from Ben Schachter from Macquarie. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys, a couple housekeeping questions and a couple of broader questions. Blake, just to be clear, the 13 million unit Star Wars forecast, is that for 3Q FY 2016 or lifetime? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : For full year 2016, fiscal 2016. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, and then really quickly maybe... Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Stephen had asked earlier what I thought the split is. I said 75%. It's probably closer to 80% in Q3 versus Q4. I just looked up the numbers. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then if you could, just help us maybe translate that 30% player growth into unit growth for FIFA and Madden. And then I have a couple of broader follow-ups after that. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I wish I could translate it, but we don't think about it that way because we think about it around engagement. Clearly, it will show unit growth, but the 30% really is a measure of not just people buying the initial game but playing the game. So it's hard to put \u2013 those are apples and oranges in that respect. But you should take that as continued unit growth in FIFA, which we are seeing. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then, as you know, given the strength this year, there are already concerns about comping revenue growth next year. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in the guidance. But how should we think about the types of games or the games that are going to come next year that will help comp against Star Wars? And then following up on Arvind's VR question, I have to keep asking these. But is EA going to wait until there's a mass market installed base, or could we see at least limited VR experiences during the launch window for some the 2016 VR hardware launches? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll let Andrew touch on the VR one if he'd like, but I'll touch on the other question. I think we try to resist giving full-year guidance ahead of time. We have mentioned in the past on our past call that you should expect another Battlefield title coming next year. We've shown Mass Effect at E3 this year. You should expect that again. And there's some indication there will be some other titles obviously that are popular along those lines, like Titanfall or others. But we are very confident we can continue to grow the business. And we also are confident that the Star Wars franchise will live well beyond this year and we think, like Battlefield, get a long tail on Star Wars into helping drive our FY 2017 business. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On VR, what we talked about in our prepared remarks is our great strengths, creativity, passion. One of those things is pioneering, and our desire as a company to lead and our belief that we have a responsibility given our position in the industry to lead. Part of why we're investing at an engine level is so that we can drive from a leadership position. While we don't have anything to announce today certainly for next year, we are looking at opportunities to do things sooner and earlier than complete mass market adoption. But again, we will be getting to a point \u2013 it's less about is there mass market adoption and more about is the technology ready for mass market adoption, and that's what we're working through right now. But we absolutely have a desire to lead, as is our responsibility for the position we have in the industry. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Next question. Operator : The next one is coming from Mike Hickey of Benchmark. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, and I also want to extend congrats on another great quarter. I guess as much as you can, I'm curious your view on Vivendi's recent investment in Ubisoft. Do you feel that perhaps there could be other potential acquisitions in the industry? And if you could update us on your current thinking around M&A and strategic partnership strategy, that would be great. And I have a follow-up. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We can't comment on Vivendi because we just don't know. You probably know more than we do. So I'll just resist on any comment there. In terms of our acquisition strategy, nothing has really changed. We look at a lot of opportunities, but we're very excited about the opportunities we have internally. Both our own IP, we've got quite a few things cooking. As you've seen, we've hired Jade Raymond from Ubisoft to help us build some new products, Amy Hennig as well. So there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to build our own IP as well as leverage our great partnerships with people like Disney and Lucas to build off of Star Wars or any of our other licensed IP. And so we see very little need right now, but we keep our eyes open, and we're always interested in seeing how things are evolving out there. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Cool. Fair enough, thank you. And I guess thinking about Nintendo's NX platform, the dev kits have apparently shipped, and it looks like it's working towards a calendar year 2016 launch. I'm just wondering how you plan to manage your resources to that emerging platform. Do you anticipate being more aggressive on the front end or perhaps a little bit more cautious given the Wii U underperformed expectations? Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to address that slightly differently. As we look to the future, we see a world where more people are playing on more platforms in more geographies than ever before. We see the platform cycle now not just as a traditional six-year console cycle, but as a six-month refresh rate on mobile devices, smart TVs, Internet-enabled refrigerators, or whatever it might be. And what we're doing in terms of resource allocation is really investing at a core digital platform level, at an engine level, and at a game architecture level to ensure that we are able to deliver amazing experiences, six inches to 60 inches and beyond, two minutes to two-hour session times and beyond across any and all relevant devices where gamers are playing. And as it relates to Nintendo, we've had a tremendous relationship with them over the years. And we will evaluate any and all opportunities with them in the same way we do all platform opportunities. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: All right, guys. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Mike, next question. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Operator, do we have any more questions? Kay? Operator : Next one is coming from Mr. Neil Doshi from Mizuho. Sir, you may begin. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Can you guys talk a little bit about micro-transactions and how you guys think about micro-transactions for some of your larger games down the road, including Star Wars, Battlefield, and Need for Speed as well? And then, Blake, I think marketing spend was a little bit lighter than we were looking for in the quarter. Any more color in terms of whether you're finding better ROI in terms of marketing channels, or whether you have to just defer some marketing spend? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the first part of that question. As it relates to any and all of our products, what our players are telling us, particularly as they engage online with their friends, is that they want to play our games longer and more frequently and for more hours at a time than ever before. And our objective, anytime we provide additional content in any form, whether free or paid, is to ensure that in all cases we provide value for the investment of any money and the investment of their time, and that in all things we are extending and enhancing the experience so that they can continue to enjoy playing the games we make with their friends for many months and years to come. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : On marketing expense, it's hard to look at any one quarter and see a major trend because of how the titles fall. And we may have marketing expenses in two quarters ahead of a title or getting spread over multiple quarters. But our general view is we've been working very closely with all of the people involved in marketing to really leverage the engagement we have with our consumer base. We're connected to all of our consumers. We have a unique opportunity to better target our marketing activities to those consumers and not needing to use some of the more traditional marketing vehicles that have less effectiveness. And you're going to see a lot more out of us in the future. You'll hear more. You'll see things related to Star Wars, for example, over the next couple of weeks, which really help people better understand the product and help target-market to specific cohorts. And it's just the way we're shifting marketing. The team has done an amazing job really redialing how we approach marketing, led by our new CMO, Chris Bruzzo. And we're going to see more of this, and we hope that it will help us continue to manage our marketing expense over time. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great, thank you. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Next question, please, operator. Operator : Next one is coming from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. So I'll ask another Star Wars question. When you look at the film, international revenues could potentially double what we're seeing here in North America. I wonder if there's any correlation in how you're thinking about sales for the game on a North American basis versus international basis. And then secondly, just one housekeeping issue with, you gave a couple reasons why guidance didn't move higher, including FX, Mirror's Edge. With the dilution from the convert because of the warrants that are there, is that another thing we need to consider for reasons why guidance didn't move higher? Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'll let Peter address the Star Wars question and then I'll talk on the dilution question. Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I think from the perspective, Eric, we look at the anticipation of what is arguably the biggest piece of intellectual property in the world that has not seen a movie in many, many years. As I think you know, the anticipation, whether it's North America, whether it's Europe, whether it's Asia, is off the charts. I don't think it correlates necessarily to how we think about it, but this is a global title. I've been traveling the world recently and checking in on all of our retail and digital channels on a global basis, and we're fired up and ready to go. The movie feels like one of the true global launches. When you start to speak with consumers around the world, the anticipation levels are high. I don't think there's a direct correlation to how we would phase our revenue from region to region. It's going to be big and bigger. Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : In terms of the dilution issue, I'd just remind everyone that the current shares that are being redeemed were issuing shares that are counterbalanced by shares in the hedge transaction that we set up. And so until the actual bond is redeemed fully next summer, the clock then starts to tick on the potential future dilution around those shares. And so the dilution will be approximately 90 days after the bond is fully redeemed, and so thus no dilution this year. We have updated our table on the website, on our IR website, to reflect that. The future dilution could occur late next year, and we'll be back to you with some of our ideas around how we're going to manage that. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Great, thank you very much. Operator : The next one is coming from Doug Creutz from Cowen & Company. Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company : Thanks. You guys were I think close to flat year over year on your physical console revenue. According to NPD and I think some of the data in the UK, you were down double digits in sell-through. Obviously, you had FX headwinds elsewhere. Can you help to square that circle? Is this a case of your retailers taking more inventory? Hello? Operator : Excuse me, sir? Hello?

[Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to your host Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir please go ahead. Chris Evenden : Thank you, Doris. Welcome to the EA's fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, and a transcript. A couple of quick notes on upcoming events; we\u2019re holding our Investor Day on Tuesday, May 17th, at our Redwood City at headquarters. This will be a great opportunity for members of the financial community to hear from our senior management team and meet with them in an informal environment. In addition, Blake will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley conference on Tuesday, March 1, and our Q4 and year-end earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, May 10th. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, January 28, 2016, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thank you, Chris. Q3 FY'16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and live services that enabled them to play more of the games they love. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter, and we are raising our full-year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum into the final quarter of the year. Our highlights from the holiday quarter capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team at DICE delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for fans of all ages. It became the largest launch ever for a Star Wars game, and exceeded our guidance for the full year. The journey is just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the four expansion packs to come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community. Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in our experiences on mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching the top 5 most-downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. On PC, our Star Wars, The Old Republic community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly three years, driven by the latest digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. More great content is on the way for players in each of these experiences, as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company. Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving, with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving two and a half times more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we\u2019ve demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans\u2019 unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deep engagement over time. Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices. As the top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world\u2019s biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the number one sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the number one title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire EA SPORTS portfolio, with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing car and car culture enthusiasts, with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous game. Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged in their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continued to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like FUT Draft in FIFA 16 and Draft Champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continue to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. In Q3, our players logged more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay. Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow in subscribers, and more than 60 % of those players have used EA Access to try a game they haven\u2019t previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we\u2019ve just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it\u2019s clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games. EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA is working to help players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition than ever for our players\u2019 time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect to vibrant communities, access more games and content, and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. EA\u2019s non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion, which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter\u2019s revenue was 26% higher than the prior year\u2019s, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our portfolio, including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full fiscal year guidance of 13 million units, which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year on year. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter\u2019s revenue. It was also a record for the trailing twelve month period which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, FIFA Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year-on-year, or 18% year-on-year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. Finally, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. Mobile generated 162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top three grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS app store through the important Christmas period and peaked at number one on Christmas Day. The two join our broad portfolio of strong revenue-generating titles, which also includes SimCity BuildIt, The Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits, and Real Racing 3 Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront, offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift-giving became the dominant driver of purchases. Note that revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes, and this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year, due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we launched a similar PC subscription service, Origin Access, in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars, The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep story-telling. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year\u2019s 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix, with Dragon Age : Inquisition last year compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We had factored into guidance our expectation that Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong gift-giving title, but it skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive, the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games, which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down 10 million year-on-year, driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up $22 million, driven chiefly by increased investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share, which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance and continued cost management. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.23 billion, or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes. During Q3, we settled 95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed 293 million of the 633 million total and as of yesterday we\u2019ve received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow ever generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing twelve month basis, operating cash flow was a $1.025 billion. Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, 21 million lower than last year\u2019s. The decline is driven by the absence of last year\u2019s Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants versus Zombies Garden Warfare 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in game sales for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecast to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year\u2019s. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year, driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share, as compared to $0.39 last year. Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion, as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46, as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last two years, in the fourth quarter we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share, but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings or cash flow. Our Q4 outlook would result in a full-year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $3 per share respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full-year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion, and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion, as capital expenditure is tracking below our 100 million estimate for the year. Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world\u2019s economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow. Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high-water mark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and licensed IP. This builds a deep catalog that sells for years and provides the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. FY'16 has been a groundbreaking year so far for Electronic Arts on so many fronts. Stunning new games, dynamic services, and new opportunities to connect and celebrate the passion for play we share with our players. Amazing game experiences begin with creativity and innovation, and we are focused on delivering that to players wherever they want to play. Leveraging the powerful Star Wars IP, we\u2019re now connected with players in live services across three games, on three platforms, and three business models. In Star Wars Battlefront, an HD console experience, we are building a major franchise with passionate fans. In Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a free-to-download game on mobile, we have a successful new live service. And in Star Wars : The Old Republic, we\u2019ve demonstrated the longevity of an experience that has great IP and content that continues to deliver enjoyment for our players. In Q4, we will go live with three new titles that further reflect the creativity, innovation and variety in our experiences today. Unravel launches on February 9, bringing Yarny\u2019s journey to life in the charming and beautiful world crafted by our partners at Coldwood Interactive. On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 goes live, with all of its over-the-top action and hilarious characters ready for new and existing fans of this beloved franchise. Then on March 15, we return to the Octagon, with EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut featuring new fighters, new physics and new modes for fight fans around the world. Looking ahead to FY17, we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises. In Q1, we\u2019ll begin with the creative and innovative Mirror\u2019s Edge Catalyst from DICE launching in May. A great line-up of EA SPORTS titles are in development for next year, and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. An all-new Battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays, we\u2019re excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming from our friends at Respawn and of course, Mass Effect Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and updates, and we\u2019ll have more new mobile titles as well. Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts, and we\u2019re thrilled to share that passion with our players through our new Competitive Gaming Division, led by Peter Moore. For years we have experienced the energy of competitive gaming through events and tournaments for our EA SPORTS and Battlefield communities. As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competitions that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway, with players competing in the Madden NFL Live Challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. We\u2019re excited to have Peter and the team unveil more of our plans as we get into FY17. From our new titles to our live services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do. Games deliver on a fundamental human need for entertainment, and for each of us that means something unique and personal. A need to connect, to compete, to explore, to improve, to challenge, to share. We are focused on understanding these needs for every player, building stronger relationships so we can fulfill them at the right place and time, and unlocking the full potential of play through amazing new experiences. The commitment we have to our players continues to transform Electronic Arts, and galvanizes our efforts to deliver disruptive and innovative new ways to play. Now Blake, Peter and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator instruction]. Our first question is from the line of Chris Merwin. Chris Merwin : I just had one on digital downloads, this past holiday season, with season industry data points to share the AAA launches really inflected higher in terms of digital. But digital downloads were just a bit lighter than we have expected for you. Blake I know you obviously comment of that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season, which I think makes a lot of sense, giving the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5 are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads, and is one point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward? And just a second quick question, just wondering if you would mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4 and when we think about the DLCs you\u2019ll be selling for that title is its fair to assume that the attached rate would be comparable to that Battlefield 4? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Sure let me start with full-game download and Andrew might want to talk a little about this Battlefield, the Battlefront engagement. First, I\u2019ll remind you that full-game downloads generated 195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that\u2019s still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full-game downloads. Since you couldn't have got a number of that side in a quarter without that. We were surprised that more gift giving was done with Star Wars which obviously impacted the digital downloads and my guess is that that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards gift giving and more towards PC, there is a very hardcore PC audience as the Battlefield audience and they tends to obviously to more physical -- digital downloads than physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin, guidance that we have talked about in the past. We will obviously give you detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title and gift giving we would be very surprised that we didn\u2019t shift back to the improvement in gross margin that we saw. Andrew Wilson : And on engagement, engagement has been strong, it's been a great game to play across most of generation, so the audience is much wider than a traditional Battlefield audience which is great for us. We\u2019re introducing new people to Electronic Arts and to games and to the first person shooter genre, we have just announced our first batch of free content and our four maps that will form part of the premium service and we expect strong engagement with that going forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju. Unidentified Analyst : This is Chris [ph] on for Steven, congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions from our end, you said you sold in 13 million units of Battlefront and the 1 million of them were bundled, wondering if you guys are seeing any excess inventory in the channel. And then can you touch a bit on what you've seen so far with Origin Access's, subscribers have the same propensity to try new games, maybe new genres that they've not played before just like EA Access? Blake Jorgensen : So, on Origin Access feeds that we just rolled it out, so it's very early days and it's hard to get any data yet. So, more to come on that. But we -- obviously we're very excited about what we've been seeing in EA Access and that was part of the reason we decided to rollout Origin Access. It's a different group of titles because not all of our titles are PC titles. So, we'll probably see some different dynamics between players but we hope to see similar dynamics that we've seen in EA Access because it's exciting to see obviously people broaden their interest in more games than simply one franchise. On your first question, the -- can you'll be back and just repeat again your -- what's you're looking for there? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, so you guys, you've sold in 13 million unit Battlefront and 1 million of that was consistent in the bundles. Do you guys have any excess inventories in that channel? Blake Jorgensen : No, we're very comfortable with where the channel is. We actually had a very strong sell-through during the quarter as well as sell-in and there are some accounts obviously that are replenishing in there -- as they get through their January timeframe and we're very comfortable with where the channel inventory is now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Colin Sebastian. Colin Sebastian : Was wondering if you can comment on the progress of the next Titanfall and with that the overall relationship was reached on for instance, the opportunities to expand that relationship to cover other titles. And then I was hoping Peter if you could expand on the e-sports opportunity, how large you guys think this could be, how impactful could it be to the overall business over the near term and then the longer term as well, that will be helpful. Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : So, I'll take the Titanfall question. Again it's really early start talking about the details of Titanfall at this juncture and that wasn't purpose of raising it, what I would say having seen the game is it's looking fantastic, our relationship with Respawn is extremely strong, we had great fight in that entire team to build a spectacular game and are really looking forward to sharing more details in the month ahead. Peter Moore : With regards to competitive gaming, I mean obviously we see a great opportunity going forward here, I'll remind you and I know you know this that we've been doing this for a number of years whether it\u2019s been our involvement with FIFA with the FIFA Interactive World Cup. As was mentioned in the prepared remarks we're looking forward to the finals of the Madden Challenge series at the Madden ball on Thursday night here in the Bay area, but we also see this maybe a little bit differently than maybe some of our publishing brethren, they're in the marketplace right now and we see this as a tool and a platform to increase engagement. More and more session days with games is good for Electronic Arts, it's good for our players, we've taken a very player-first view on this and which we're building community. It's clearly an entertainment medium, I think there's a lot of excitement around it and I can't think of anybody that's better served with the diversity of our portfolio when you think about sports titles in particular, FIFA and Madden as well as our Battlefield franchise have been able to build a meaningful business over the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Fitz. Unidentified Analyst : Jay [ph] in for Brian. Just another question on Star Wars, so just wondering how much of the mix shift towards physical discs, do you attribute to heavy promotional activity like GameStop\u2019s $40 sale. So, I'm just curious about how those kinds of retail promotions, how effective are they in terms of attracting new users, and just on the same subject I know you take a 20% reserve on gross revenue for each in the shipped. I'm just curious if you could quantify the impact to your P&L and GameStop who offers discounts like we saw, how's the impact -- how does this impact gross margin? Thanks. Peter Moore : So, I'll comment firstly to this discounting in general, this is a business that in the holiday timeframe between Black Friday and Christmas is traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume particularly when people are now buying -- who're buying for the first time the new console offerings often they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we found the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We obviously shared that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that, each year with specific programs and I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that. We're also doing discounting on the digital side as we try to keep the two aligned. We don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. And so you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year-in, year-out. I would say this year our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had, there wasn't a lot of different between years. On the sales reserve we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter and anticipation of what our selling is going to be and we use those sales reserve during the quarter on a very formalize planned method . So all this sales get planned well in advance. We need to make sure that we have the appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those overtime. And so we will be setting up sales reserves each quarter as we go in those cannot impact margins or margins that we forecast because they\u2019re already build into the numbers. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks and then if I could I believe that Andrew mentioned that you are attracting a new type of demographic to Star Wars, I am just wondering for any sort of color on that. What the -- who are the new players, what is the demographic breakdown look like of that game? And what types of new -- what's the new demographic your attracting to the EA trend? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes, I can take that. So what we have seen is really there is two groups that have either come for the first on or have come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly of my generation or my vintage, who have been gamers in the past, have for whatever reason moved away from it and particularly moved away from cool FPS shooters because they\u2019ve became very hard and complicated and quite rightly brutal to play online. They\u2019ve come back in a lot of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and the passion they have around that from their youth. At the same time they now have kids, we are of game playing age who may not have got into the first person shooter universe yet because of the nature of the content sort of some of those games. And so we\u2019re seeing fathers and sons play, we are seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal and so the big groups that we\u2019ve added is kind of a huge demographic, it\u2019s typically younger than we have seen before as well as an older demographic that we may have had interaction with some years ago, but had lapsed out in recent years particularly from the first person shooter universe. And we\u2019re looking now at how we continue to provide content and experience that engage those two new groups so that we maintain relationship with them overtime. Operator : Our next question is from line of Justin Post. Ryan Gee : This is Ryan on for Justin. First of on Star Wars congratulations on this shipments, wondering if you could talk about how demand is looking in early 4Q? And then maybe how much you expect that title to contribute either digitally or physically or combined during the quarter? And then you highlighted some of the titles that you guys are working on especially for next year, wondering how you are thinking about spacing for all those titles, Battlefield, Mass Effect, Titanfall and maybe Mirror\u2019s Edge is in there as well?  And then lastly, just going to the digital in the mix shift, is it fair to say that really this digital mix shift away from full-game download is one time in nature and just really the specific Star Wars titled, or is there any reason for us you think that EA won\u2019t continue to see the benefit on the margin side from the industry going digitally and in into 4Q and then in this fiscal '17? Blake Jorgensen : I don\u2019t think there is any indications of that, this mix shift isn\u2019t anything about a Star Wars, Battlefront opportunity remember the movie was out. All things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect gift giving opportunity. And typically with gift someone wants to have a package under a tree or and a gift pile somewhere versus that digital code and that was the driver of the shift. We could see when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing for ourselves for the industry and exactly how the buzz around Star Wars will be when that comes again the next time around. So right now I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact if we look all of our non-Star Wars products every one of them we\u2019re up, digitally and full-game download and the digital engagement associated with. If you look at Ultimate Teams specific we gave you, that\u2019s a clear sign that people are planning and engaging longer and longer around the titles. In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we not going to breakdown individual guidance, obviously we will end up selling more than the 13 million units since we\u2019ve already got there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell in the fourth quarter than we originally part. But we\u2019ll clearly sell more overall and that\u2019s build into our guidance for the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll remind people about fourth quarter though, don\u2019t forget that there was a continued FX headwinds, headwind that we called out that\u2019s $40 million of headwinds, I\u2019m not sure everyone\u2019s modeling that into their models. And we\u2019re not ignoring the fact that there is an economic headwind out there around the world that hasn't really impacted us, but we\u2019re being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely. In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along within traditional sport titles. The one thing to note is Q1 the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror\u2019s Edge, plus all of our catalog business and live services business. But our core console title will be Mirror\u2019s Edge and if you are doing -- we\u2019ll give you real full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call, but as you starting to think about guidance for Q1 in next year don't forget about the continued FX headwinds which are impacting us as well as in Q1 one specific item, remember that last year in Q1 we had a $30 million benefit, one-time benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue all into Q1. So, that was high profit revenue that came into Q1. Couple of basic things for your model but things to remember. But we're excited about the rest of the slate, you should assume that a Battlefield would come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it, we're not yet announcing when Titanfall or Mass Effect Andromeda will come, but you should assume that\u2019s in the back half of the year as well because of second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles. Ryan Gee : And then if I can add one last follow-up, it's a nice pickup in mobile revenue, do you guys happen to have an updated MAU figure that you could share? Blake Jorgensen : We don't, but we probably will in the next quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arvind Bhatia. Arvind Bhatia : A couple of questions, one I know you guys touched on Madden NFL Mobile, did really well this quarter, wondering what are some of the learning's Andrew, in particular that maybe you could apply to FIFA Mobile and other titles specifically. And then wondering if you guys are willing to share the mix of full game, digital downloads on some of the key titles during the quarter. And for any of you I guess just reluctant thoughts on virtual reality and your efforts there currently? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : I'll take the Madden Mobile one, as we think about all of our mobile games, you really think about them on four vectors; discovery, how someone will find the title whether that's through an App Store or through social representation, on boarding, how someone will get into the title, the games like mechanic itself, so actually what do you do while you're playing the game and then how that how do we run the servers that actually surrounds that game to make it new and interesting, fun and dynamic, and engaging on a moment-to-moment day-to-day basis. As we look at what we've done with Madden NFL Mobile over the last couple of years you will have seen we\u2019ve fundamentally overhauled all four of those vectors since we first launched Madden on mobile devices. We now believe we have landed in a place that has a game that is very social in nature, has a game that onboard the new players and a broad demographic of players, we have a game mechanic that feels right for mobile devices and our change of delivering live events that's tied to the passion of players have for the real world of the NFL and a very engaging forum on an ongoing basis. But during the weekend games and the week leading up to those games, all of those opportunities present learning for us as we take these types of things to our other sports games on mobile and we expect to be able to do well in those areas. Blake Jorgensen : Arvind your second question was about trends in full game downloads, we clearly continue to see them trending upwards, we see titles running anywhere between 20% and 30% plus, we've always seen FIFA skew lower because in Europe many retailers use that as a loft leader to drive traffic into their stores and that tends to be a physical copy, but in the rest of our sports portfolio we tend to see strong digital full game, really Star Wars was the only Gen4 title than indexed lower than average because of the gift-giving issues. So, we're very comfortable with continuation of where that trend is going industry wide. Arvind Bhatia : And then on VR? Andrew Wilson : Sorry, virtual reality, sorry, the context of VR? Arvind Bhatia : Just wondering if your -- what's your investments are currently and how you're viewing sort of the opportunity this year and perhaps for the next couple of years, if you have any titles currently in development and any early thoughts there? Andrew Wilson : Sure, and I\u2019ll echo what we've talked about on some previous calls which is we believe that VR is going to be an important part of that industry. We do believe it's a number of years out before it's a meaningful part of our industry but right now we're investing at a core engine level, we've talked about Frostbite as we move to a single engine for the company and that team is working to ensure that they can output virtual reality experiences regardless of device. And then we have a few key game teams around the company who are doing targeted experiments as it relates to very engaging virtual reality experiences in the context of particular genres. I would expect that we would start to surface some of those over the coming years. And that we would start to build that into a more fully fledged experience over time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Olson. Mike Olson : You had an obviously big launch with Star Wars in the quarter, and no doubt that had some marketing and other expenses. And yet the overall OpEx was basically down year over year, so the cost containment efforts continue to remain strong. How do you think about OpEx going forward with a lot of these incremental titles coming in fiscal 2017? Is there a reason to think that OpEx will start to creep higher? Is that kind of a reasonable multi-year run rate going forward where we are at this year? Andrew Wilson : I think peer dollar OpEx is got -- we\u2019ve got an benefit this year of FX on our OpEx line because many of our studios are outside the U.S. so we have a large base obviously in Sweden, in Canada, in Romania, in Australia, many in China, many of those have obviously coming at lower dollar cost. We try to report each quarter with the actual dollar costs are and you\u2019ve seen some continued investments. Our goal to try to keep R&D expenses around to 22% to 23% of revenue line, which means even if our revenues is growing, we\u2019re clearly continuing to invest in R&D we think that\u2019s very important for our future. You will see marketing expenses bounced around depending on the title and the quarter. So this quarter our marketing expenses were up in -- if you\u2019ve -- FX adjust them and that was driven by the factor that we had a fairly large title this year that we didn\u2019t have in year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars is obviously last year our large title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter. Until you get some of that timing differences but you\u2019ll continue to see general increases in our OpEx with goal to try to target, R&D around the 22% to 23%, we\u2019re trying to push marketing expenses down into the 13% range and hold G&A in that 8% to 7% range if possible. So that\u2019s you\u2019re going to see as a percentage revenue and hopefully will continue to be reflected in our business going forward. Mike Olson : Okay. And then just one quick one. Is there any detail you can give on the timing of the first monetized Star Wars expansion pack? Is that in the month of March, and if so, can you say that early or late in the month? Andrew Wilson : I can\u2019t tell you much more than March, but I would assume that much of that revenue will probably fall in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter but it\u2019s hard to see right now. Mike Olson : Okay. That answers the question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum. Drew Crum : So Ultimate Team up 13% in the quarter, it seems like an impressive number, given the comp. And I think you guys had some pull-forward recognized in the second quarter. So what is Ultimate Team up year to date and can you comment on the expectations on Ultimate Team going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I don\u2019t have the year-to-date number with me here. But it's fairly consistent with what it was in the quarter, just off the top of my head and we\u2019re continuing to see that. Remember we had a slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team in the fourth quarter last year as we put the price banding and to address the inflation in the market place issue that we saw. We are currently forecasting that we will have a stronger fourth quarter that we did last year. Because obviously we corrected some those price and coin farming issues. So we should continue to see strong growth of Ultimate Team through the year and probably for the full year clearly exceed because it's a lean last quarter last year. But clearly the business continues to grow and we done a good job of bringing new users in. So we\u2019re not taxing the existing users, but it gets harder and harder to grow the business at the size that it\u2019s at. So we\u2019ll see what it looks like for next year. The other thing to really remember as you\u2019re looking at it is realize that a huge portion of the ultimate team audience for FIFA is outside the U.S. large markets like France, Germany, UK and so all of those markets have a headwind from FX in them that we\u2019re clearly seeing in the growth numbers. So as I mentioned today 18% on a constant currency basis for ultimate team or for FIFA and that\u2019s a pretty impressive growth rate on a business of that size. Drew Crum : Got it. Okay, thanks. And aspirational number on R&D as a percentage of revenue, how important is culling less profitable or non-profitable titles in the portfolio? Do you have an opportunity to do that going forward? How you think about limiting the number of SKUs going forward? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : We are down to less than 15 majors SKUs, and that feels like a good size of the business and we are obviously announcing that we\u2019re investing in some action base SKUs by bringing people like Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig into our organization to help build those and those are obviously a few years out in our SKU plan, but clearly we want to try grow genre and grow our revenue based with more titles both digital live services titles as well as traditional console titles. Part of -- to do that part of it we have to be restless that we don\u2019t spend a lot of money on smaller titles, we size them correctly, but we also want to continue to look for ways to bring new interesting titles to the market. Look at Unravel as a perfect case of that. We are trying to address the market place for broader titles addressing wider audience in terms of the types they are and the types of games people want to play. We are also trying to build enough product to be able to effectively run subscription based businesses and the requires a great portfolio which we have and we'll continue to add to. So, we'll always cull but there's not a certain things that cut back on today because we've brought the total number of titles down to a very perfect level for us now. Operator : Our next is from the line of Ben Schachter. Ben Schachter : So there's been a lot of pretty positive commentary, including Star Wars beating and getting reorders in 4Q, but then you don't see that really flow through for the fiscal year guidance. I was wondering if you could just talk more about why, and is it all weakness in prior gen, is it all FX, is there anything else going on there that we should know about. Secondly, FIFA in China, can you just talk about how meaningfully we should be thinking about that business for FY2017? And then finally, of course, I have to ask another VR question. And understanding that is not going to be meaningful for a number of years, is it possible that we will get any of those what you've defined the VR experiments or small experiences, any chance we will get those in calendar 2016? Blake Jorgensen : Ben, I guess I would remind people that we did raise full year guidance, that's the third time this year we've raised full year guidance, we've got a track record I think of 10 quarters in a row of beating our guidance. I think we've exhibited some conservative in how we operate the business which we think is the prudent thing to do and we're sitting with FX headwinds and a lot of uncertainty in the economy. You put all that together, I don't think that signals anything negative about the fourth quarter, it signals the way we've been approaching the business and operating the business and that's what we're going to continue to do. In terms of FIFA Online 3 in China, the key there is we're continuing to see very positive reactions, but we also have a very long-term view there. So, that continued level that we've talked about 10 million to 15 million a quarter is still consistent with where we are and when we do give you guys guidance in the May timeframe, we'll update that number if it looks like it should be updated, but all is very positive in that and our partner TenCent continues to be extremely happy. With that maybe I'll let Andrew hit the VR question, to say more to say of that we already said but. Andrew Wilson : Not a lot more to say at this point, no announcement as to launch times or servicing the experiments at this stage, but as we go into calendar '16 as we start to come closer to our EA play events in LA and in London we'll be talking more about our full title slide and some of the new in development products that we have running it across our studios right now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Neil Doshi. Neil Doshi : Two questions. Blake, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment and kind of what you guys are seeing as we move into calendar 2016? And then secondly, we've noticed -- I think Amazon announced that they are putting out a promotion for Prime members. So every time a large AAA game it goes up for sale on preorder, a couple weeks after, they're going to give a pretty hefty 20% discount. Can you talk about whether you guys are helping to fund that or if that's something that Amazon is just kind of taking on their own? And how you think that could potentially impact digital sales, since those are primarily for physical discs. Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : On a macro environment we've mentioned a couple of times our cautioned because of the macro environment, we have not seen anything in our business or heard anything from other players in the business that would imply any economic slowdown in entertainment software. I then say we have a level of conservatism about the, just the global economy which at some point in time there is trouble in the global economy that would impact everybody probably. I think our business seems to be operating pretty consistent as it has been over the last couple of years. The console purchases are up through the end of calendar year '15, our estimate is 55 million units out there which has exceeded virtually everyone's forecast for the year and now almost 50% higher than previous console cycle so, all of that is very-very positive, all the game play we're seeing and the engagement and things like Ultimate Team we're seeing is positive. We\u2019re just conscious of the fact that there's a lot of storm clouds out there, we want to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves or the economy in our forecast for the business and that's what you're hearing. The second part of the question was the Amazon issue, we do not fund the Amazon discount, that comes out of Amazon\u2019s own pocket and I think that's fairly consistent how Amazon operates and we don't have much say or view on pricing of anyone in the marketplace, that's their job not our job. For us if it brings new game players into the business then we're excited, but we don't really have much more to say or control over their pricing strategy. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz. Doug Creutz : You guys announced your EA Play event a few days ago and obviously you made the interesting decision to not have a booth on the floor of E3 this year. Just curious as to your thinking about why do that? If I recall, one of your major competitors made a similar decision several years ago, ultimately decided it was not the way to go. Is there anything that's changed that's led you to that decision? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : So, what we're seeing is more and more we need to be close to our player. And what you have seen from last couple of years in almost all of our actions whether it relates to development or marketing or sales is attempts by us and endeavors by us to get as close as possible to our players and get direct feedback from them. We believe that\u2019s the single best way to ensure that we are making games that they want to play. And then we\u2019re making some of the best games in the industry. And we see this as an opportunity to do just that get close to our players, invite them in an environment where they feel comfortable to play games, give us feedback. And interact socially as they do whether through social networks or with their friend or what have you. We continue to be member of the ESA and we will have meeting rooms at E3 this year. So what we see we\u2019re doing is augmenting the overall E3 experience. And we are excited by what we\u2019re going to be able to do as it relates to EA Play and we are excited for what the industry is going to be able to do as it relates to E3 more broadly. Blake Jorgensen : And to add to that we are also doing a simultaneous events in London and so in some ways we are trying to do a more geographically spread way to introduce people to our new product. Operator : Our next last question is from the line of Eric Handler. Eric Handler : Thanks for taking my question just under the wire there. Two things for you, first, with Star Wars, obviously you are not making a Star Wars movie game, but you got nice leverage off of The Force Awakens this December. How are you thinking about what you can do with Star Wars Battlefront next December, when the first spinoff movie comes out, Rogue One. Is there much you can do around that to keep monetization levels high? And then secondly, looking at your mobile business, after the first two quarters of the year, mobile is really stagnant. You got strong growth in the third quarter with Madden and Star Wars. I'm just seeing as we think about the mobile business going forward, is this sort of the inflection point where we start seeing some reacceleration of revenue or [Audio Gap] sustainable is the improvements there? Or maybe talk about some of your plans with mobile. Blake Jorgensen : So I\u2019ll start with Star Wars, I don\u2019t know Andrew might want to chime in mobile piece. On Star Wars, the one thing that we are adhering to, and I think this is part of our arrangement with Lucas and Disney, is you can't make a game in Star Wars that violates the canon of Star Wars mainly you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in to the extent that it's in the future around our current Battlefront game is also a paced based on the historical Star Wars canon, which is 30 years before the most recent movie than will limit our ability to bring some new content into that. But more to come there obviously, we\u2019re trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies and we we\u2019ll obviously in future Star Wars games be able to tap to new characters and vehicles and so far. But in our current game and for that manner the DLC associated with that current game obviously we\u2019ll have to be careful that we don\u2019t violate the cannon. On mobile, obviously mobile the one thing remember is like our console business, mobile will always be a little choppy based on when new title come at. But like most live services they should be smoother than the historical beats around console business. So overtime it helps to smooth that out, but there is still maybe some jumps up and then do the quarters. Andrew Wilson : Yes on the Star Wars play, I\u2019ll just to add a little. I mean what we have seen is that the movie or the content of the movie itself hasn't impeded the engagement in various Star War games. We have seen that across console PC and the mobiles. And we would expect that as more great Star Wars films come out, we would see more great engagement in Star Wars content more broadly again not just in Battlefront but in Star Wars The Old Republic and our mobile game Galaxy of Heroes. As we think about mobile, just to add to Blake\u2019s point I think he\u2019s absolutely right. The one other thing that we would point to is as we look at our mobile portfolios our titles typically have very long life spans. The Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Real Racing 3 have continued to grow over a number of years. And as we think about launching new titles, we\u2019re taking a little more time and being a little bit more calculated about how we launch, but we\u2019re doing so with a view that we are putting experiences into the market place that will live for many years and drive engagement and profitability for a number of years to come. And so as we look at the year to come, as we look at what we\u2019ve done with Star Wars and Madden and some other titles that are coming again to shoot. Our expectation is that we\u2019re able to grow the overall business with them. Andrew Wilson : Alright thank you everyone. We will see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you gentlemen this does conclude today's conference call you may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. FY 2016 was a phenomenal year for Electronic Arts. Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record levels and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones, demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies, and platforms to the games they love and to each other. To highlight a few examples, we kicked off a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts with extraordinarily successful games on console, PC, and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year. Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our Sims 4 player base grew by almost two-thirds throughout the year, and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone. In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile. Engagement in Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional, with players spending nearly two hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance, with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year, and The Sims FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs life to date. With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth, and value. Engagement is critical in today's world, where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP, and sophisticated services, we continue to build networked global communities for our games, where players can connect to more great content and to their friends, maximizing the fun every time they play. As we move into FY 2017, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players. Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat rendered in stunning beauty by our Frostbite engine. The first of our EA SPORTS titles for this year, Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17, arrive in Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion, and competition. We are also working on a new and engaging way to bring players into our NBA LIVE franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead. In a global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense, visceral combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from DICE, and the response was immediate and extraordinary. The trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first four days, a new record for EA, and it's now our most-liked trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety in the gameplay powered by our Frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21. In partnership with the talented team at Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The excitement from fans since our official announcement of the game has been outstanding, and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA Play on June 12. Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect : Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically-acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands. Building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring new EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA LIVE and FIFA franchises to players in FY 2017. Fans of our PopCap franchises will have new experiences as well, with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year. Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow, and in each dimension EA is at the leading edge. In addition to being the number one publisher in the western world on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY 2016 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to pioneer new growth opportunities. Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels, with competitions like the Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR. In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends. Across our studio teams, partners like Respawn Entertainment, and labs groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies, and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA Play will bring players closer than ever to our games and help them share those experiences with the world. FY 2016 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts, and we are just getting started. Looking to FY 2017 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year. Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin, at just 9.5% four years ago, was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver these results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million. Digital revenue is now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX, and up 26% at constant currency. Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue. During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again, a record. Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive, as do our mobile titles, led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $712 million. This resulted in a full-year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion. Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of these businesses. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year. Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services adds to the broad portfolio of EA Mobile games which deliver a consistent and profitable revenue stream. Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year. And finally, subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year. Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year, and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above the prior year. One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses relative to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit of $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal 2016 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50, but it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million, compared to $198 million in the prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion, and above our raised guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation. Fiscal 2016 capital expenditures were $93 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion. During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of five-year and 10-year investment-grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program, over and above the two-year, $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter, and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchase this quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the two-year program available for repurchases. For the fiscal year, we've returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimate that our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares. During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we've redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilution from these redemptions, the warrants, and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S. Now, on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current-generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console growth, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android, and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming. We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect : Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, and the expansion of our mobile business. The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website. The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise 110 basis points, to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect : Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal 2016. The increase is driven by R&D investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre; an extension of our partnership with Respawn; our digital player platform; competitive gaming; and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX. This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million shares. The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And, with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs, but not to factor in any potential reduction from our on-going buyback program. The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year. Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full-year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%. Breaking down our digital revenue into its four primary categories we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles. Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital downloads in fiscal 2016. For example, downloads of Madden for all consoles are up 50% year-on-year, and we expect this trend to continue. Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4, and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%. Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access, and partially offset by the falloff of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71%, and operating expenses of around $2.31 billion, and EPS of $2.53. Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities. Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13 weeks this year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products, offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar. For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share, as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion, as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. And GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30, as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year. As we look forward to Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched two weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, rather than the usual one week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue, and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern, with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4. In conclusion, it was a great year for EA, with financial and engagement records set across the board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises under development to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS, and cash flow growth into the future. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Blake. Our industry continues to grow. Across the world, more players are engaging in more games on more platforms across more geographies and business models. Yet as our audience expands, it is evolving as well. The competition for time means there is no room for transient experiences. Players today expect more from the games they play, and in return they will spend more time with the games they love. In a world where discovery is increasingly difficult and engagement decisions are made every second, connecting players with the right experience when and where they want to play is critical. In this transforming world, our focus continues to be on meeting and exceeding our players' needs through direct relationships that add value at every turn. Today, Electronic Arts engages hundreds of millions of players, and in the future potentially billons, through great games and live services in our powerful brands like Battlefield, FIFA, Star Wars, The Sims, Plants vs. Zombies, Mass Effect, and more. This portfolio of IP combined with great talent and robust technology in our underlying platform differentiates EA in our ability to connect players to more games, to more friends, and more ways to engage in a global network of play. It always begins with great games, and in FY 2017 we will deliver some of the most creative, engaging, and biggest experiences to date from Electronic Arts. We also continue to foster and grow thriving communities across our portfolio of live services. Our teams are leveraging technologies like Frostbite to deliver new experiences across more devices. As we evolve our core platform, we are learning more about our players and adding capabilities to unlock greater value for them. New programs, including competitive gaming, will help us reach and connect more players around the world. These are the dimensions of connected play that today's players seek and that Electronic Arts is positioned to lead. These are foundational times for the future of games and how we play them. We're excited for FY 2017 and beyond and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead. With that, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you for taking my question, two questions. Can you talk about your investment this year and your guidance for the action adventure titles, and could we see something as soon as fiscal 2018 on that front? And then a large competitor, maybe this is for Andrew, has talked a lot about eSports. And how do you see that opportunity for your first-person shooters and also your big sports titles? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Justin, thanks for the question. Why don't I start with the investment piece? We're making broad investments that fuel the growth of the company well beyond fiscal 2018 and 2019. Really today we're building an action genre product that's probably in our fiscal 2020 or 2021, as well as action-oriented games around the Star Wars genre. Most of what we're investing in that's incremental now probably comes in fiscal 2019 and 2020. But clearly, some of our investment is to grow out our product base for what we're going on as well. We do have a new IP coming next year. We haven't yet announced it, but it's something that you'll see probably coming up soon. And clearly that's part of our investment for the franchise, as well as continuing building out the Battlefront franchise with Star Wars for fiscal 2018 as well. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As it relates to competitive gaming, Peter Moore, our Head of our Competitive Gaming Group, is going to deliver a lot more in terms of understanding at our upcoming Investor Day. The group overall is focused on enabling global communities through great games. So this absolutely includes the elite division, but we also believe there is an opportunity to celebrate the talent and skill at every level of game play. So for some, that will mean elite play. For others, that will just mean the joy of competition with friends, and we believe there is going to be a robust community and resulting engagement that we can build as a result of that. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, great. Thank you. I just had a couple questions. So first of all, on extra content, that reaccelerated really nicely in the fiscal fourth quarter. So I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color about what drove the improvement there. I think you called out mid-20% in constant currency growth for Ultimate Team, but I was also curious what lift you got from the Star Wars DLC as well. And then just a second question on non-GAAP gross margins. I think you got about 100 basis points of margin expansion year on year, which is consistent with the long-term guidance, but I just was curious what that assumed for digital downloads as a percentage of total for the year and how the download patterns for Battlefield One might differ from Star Wars Battlefront. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So extra content obviously was dominated by Ultimate Team, but also FIFA Online 3 in Asia continues to grow, which falls in that. We saw continued growth of our original Star Wars product, Star Wars : The Old Republic, as well as extra content associated with The Sims, with Battlefield 4, and obviously the start of the Battlefront extra content. The bulk of that, though, is on components I just mentioned that really drove outsized performance in the quarter for extra content. In terms of guidance going forward, assumptions around full game downloads, we assume that we're continually going to see growth that we saw like in the past year. Industry now is above 30%, I think it's reaching 32%. And we're fairly consistent with that, with some titles as we mentioned in the script that are well north of that. Gen 4 Madden, for example, was well north of 50% when you look at a full-year number. So you're starting to see dramatic movements there. We should see greater improvement next year because we won't have the skewing towards physical that we saw in the Battlefront gift giving that we saw around the holiday and we mentioned in our last quarter. And that forecast has driven what we're seeing in our uptick, about 110% in gross margin growth year over year. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. So, Andrew, I'm looking at the proposed release slate for 2017. I think you have Titanfall launching alongside Battlefield and NBA launching during the basketball season? So obviously this brings up concerns around cannibalization and mistiming, so I'm wondering if you can offer some additional perspective there. And also what do you think the underlying factors were that drove success for Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, and how much of this can be replicated in your other mobile sports or action releases? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in terms of the Titanfall, Battlefield One question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There is a very broad and diverse set of players who play games in that category who are looking for \u2013 to fulfill different game play motivations. Some people play very quick play, some people more strategic play, and some people want both in different context. The result of those, we feel like we actually have a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of game play mechanics as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the two titles, and feel very confident that we are well-positioned to do very well in that category in a year. Certainly as you see, the reception around Battlefield 1 we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nicely, and we look forward to showing more of both of those titles at EA Play in June. As it relates to Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there is really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP like Star Wars in the mobile space, and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI, and just general game play mechanics, but perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we are capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not far and forget games. The teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day, and we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well-known and well-recognized IP in the industry. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Stephen, I think a good analogy is the successful formula that drives Ultimate Team is continual events and activities. Team of the Week example would be a great example. We're using that same approach in many of our mobile games to drive that same type of engagement where people are continually coming back because we're making the game exciting, fresh, new, and competitive. And that's exactly what people want to get out of an experience that they've invested time in. And it's a great formula. And we certainly, as we mentioned on the call, hope to be able to leverage that in our other sports games as well as non-sports games. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks and congratulations on another good quarter. I have a couple of questions. First one to ask, follow-up on Battlefield 1 and the selection of World War I as the background setting. On one hand, this sounds quite intriguing and we know that the World War II genres in the past did quite well. So notwithstanding that, the initial reception sounds very positive here. I wonder what your consumer testing says about the appeal of this historical event in a genre that's been dominated by futuristic backdrops, and then I have one follow-up. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think it's a great question and certainly one that we've been asked a number of times. When the teams set out to deliver the next version of Battlefield, they wanted to do a lot of things with the game. They wanted to be the biggest Battlefield game. They wanted to be the most diverse Battlefield game. They wanted fundamentally new game play mechanics with evolution of story, interwoven characters, storylines, evolution of machinery, evolution of weaponry, a real opportunity to build and grow inside of a Battlefield universe. When I took a step back and asked themselves what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their history classes, I guess, is that people rode into World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scaled experience and I think what we've shown so far is a small taste of that and we look forward to spending time and giving people even more information and a deeper look at that as we come into EA Play in June. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Andrew. And looking ahead in terms of the Star Wars franchise, I wonder if you could update on the progress and the potential timing of the titles from Motive and Respawn and how they fit into the release cadence for that license over the next few years. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll most likely have at least one Star Wars title a year over the next three years to four years. Next year we will see Star Wars Battlefront back with bigger and better worlds, because we now have the new movies to work off of, not just the historical movies that we used before. We also are working on a Star Wars action game that part of the Motive team is working on as well as the Visceral team. And that's most likely the following year. And as we've announced, we're working with our partners, Respawn, to work on another Star Wars game. They're very excited about that. They were asking us to include them in the franchise, and we felt that they could add a huge amount to a new title there. So the cadence should be at least every year along with the cadence of the large and small movies that Disney is doing, or side movies that Disney is doing, relative to Star Wars. And then obviously we'll continue to layer in mobile titles where possible as well to try to have a diverse Star Wars activity from shooters all the way through action and strategy, but at the same time taking advantage of all the new great IP that's being developed by our partners at Disney. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks, Blake. Operator : And your next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks so much. One more on Battlefield. It's getting very positive reception on YouTube and other online forums so far to date. We don't actually recall such strong early interest in the franchise. Are there other internal metrics that you would provide to give us confidence that this game is truly tracking ahead of the previous versions? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, again, we have been delighted with the reception. It's our most liked trailer to date. And depending on what metrics you look at from YouTube, it may be the most liked trailer ever on YouTube. We see that as a real positive sign for the franchise. The community has been asking for innovation, the community has been asking for something different. And our DICE team did step out and build something truly epic and respond to the community's demands. And their feedback has been resoundingly positive. As it relates to how the game is tracking, the game is doing really, really well. We recently had key franchise reviews where more of the game is playable at this stage than has ever been in the case in Battlefield before. The Frostbite engine is robust in its foundation and this is a very tried and true team who build unbelievable experiences. And so we have deep confidence in them to execute against their ambition. And we look forward to demonstrating more of that at EA Play in June. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And like most of our large titles, you'll tend to see more and more during this summer, at Gamescom late in the summertime. Most likely some further game play either in the form of a beta or something to that extent. So you'll have plenty of ways to better understand the depth of the product and excitement around the product as the next few months come by. And we'll try to keep you informed in our next earnings call on how we see the demand developing for the product. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Thank you. Great quarter, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about Titanfall 2 a little bit and how we should think about the title relative to its predecessor in terms of units perhaps. Obviously the previous one was very successful, but it had some unique circumstances. It wasn't on all-platforms, but I know it had a high attach rate as being one of the key early titles. So if you could just put that in perspective. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Clearly, we're very excited about it. We've seen it a couple of times over the last few months, and it's well along the way. And it has evolved substantially from the first Titanfall. First Titanfall was fantastic. This has added a whole new level to the game and the experience. It will be on both platforms, which obviously means, a bigger audience for Titanfall, particularly with the Sony platform is the one that hasn't experienced it. So they'll get a chance to experience the game. But at the same time, obviously the attach won't be anywhere near as high as it was, because it was one of the first AAA titles for the new Xbox One. And so obviously a lower attach. We think you're going to see numbers clearly larger than our Titanfall 1 franchise. And we've got good expectations for it, but we've tried to be prudent in how we forecast that in our guidance. Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hey, good afternoon. I had a couple questions if I could. First you might dive into this at the Analyst Day but in addition to continued mix shift towards full game downloads and digital add-on content, how do you think about the evolution of revenue mix over the next few years related to subscription, free-to-play, et cetera? I guess should we anticipate much of a change or will it be kind of primarily a continuation of growth in full game downloads and add-on content that we're seeing today? And then second, regarding past comments that you've made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits? In other words, if it appears that it could be tracking towards double digits part way through the year, would you push titles into fiscal 2018 in order to manage the growth rate? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And obviously based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business, and you'll see that continue to grow. In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was a series of DLCs over time, and that's what's made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to probably see some of that as we have different accounting methods. But I think the combination of extra content and subscriptions should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix. I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of growth, and the combination of mobile plus extra content and subscriptions is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads, we mentioned worth $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time. On the revenue growth, let me be clear. It's not our aspirations to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to over-invest and not deliver the revenue. That was the problem we had historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth simply because that's how we think about our investments, but we're trying to drive higher revenue growth if possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis and decide if we can push the revenue harder or not. And sometimes products get moved based on when those products re ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth, and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double digits, that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth, and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So the guidance for OpEx this year is $2.1 billion. You ran through the details behind that. Is that a new normal or the run rate we should expect beyond fiscal 2017? Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's probably in that zone. It could be plus or minus $25 million or $30 million. I remind people there are a couple components to that. One is our marketing and sales. We've tried to target that number between 12% and 13% of revenue. So obviously in a bigger revenue year like this year, we're going to spend more on marketing and sales to support things like Battlefield and Titanfall. So that's going to see a flux up and down based on the revenue component. Our R&D expenses we've tried to target around 21% to 22% of revenue, and we're tracking around that level now. And we feel like there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to invest in new areas of the business like the action genre where we haven't competed historically. It's a very ripe opportunity for us. And we've been able to bring great talent in to try to build out that part of the business. Our mobile areas with new studios coming on has also been important for us, and we'll continue to invest there. And then last but not least, continuing to build out the platform in which we operate all our games on and we're trying to leverage through that network will continue to be a key part of our investment. So you'll probably see that rough level as a percentage of sales be the focus going forward, which is a combination of the R&D level around 21% to 22%, marketing in the 12% to 13%, and G&A in the 7% to 8% range. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay, and then one question for Andrew perhaps. Some of your competitors have talked about plans or initiatives around advertising in their mobile titles. Is that something that's contemplated in your 2017 guidance? And then can you talk about any targeted advertising you're doing or would like to do in some of your sports titles going forward? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's again a great question. Advertising is certainly an important part of our business, both now and going forward. We have had ads in both our console games and our mobile games for some years, and that business has continued to grow. We often walk the fine line between maintaining the integrity of the entertainment experience with the provision of advertising inside those experiences. Right now, we have ad technology that we are implementing in some of our key mobile titles that is very targeted in nature and we believe is additive to the overall experience in the long term, and players have been responding positively to that. So there is some advertising in our FY 2017 number. I would expect that as our network continues to grow beyond the hundreds of millions that we have today that it will become a more meaningful part of our business in the future. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : One thing to remember there, particularly for us, is that there's both the ability to sell advertising but maybe equally or more important is the ability to cross-promote to players to keep them in your network. And as we have a broader and broader portfolio of games, particularly in mobile, that cross-promotion advertising is very valuable to us. Holding on to a player in your network is very powerful, and so you'll see that type of advertising, which may be less obvious to the average user than a traditional advert that you might see in a game. Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Research. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys, congratulations on a great year. On the full-game downloads, is there anything you guys are going to do to try to increase it via discounts or other promotions, or are you pretty happy to see it grow organically? And then also, if you're already over 30%, where do you think that number will be in FY 2017 in the next two years? And then separately, on Battlefield 1, any notable increases in in-game monetization, or will it be continued more maps and those kind of things? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So let me take the first one and then I'll have Andrew talk a little bit about Battlefield. It's a difficult prediction. We know that PCs took about eight years to go from zero to 75% in full-game downloads, but there are a lot of differences between the PC business and the console business. We do know that the consumer is very interested in convenience, and we want to have product wherever the consumer wants to shop, be it a retail store or a console. We obviously have great partners in retail and we want to continue to have great partners over time, and so we will support them with great in-store merchandise and training and support. And at the same time try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over the last couple of years since Gen 4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from say the high-20%s to the mid-30%s? We do think that's possible. I think the big issues remain bandwidth. They remain cashless transactions. Many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally as well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support the growth of full game downloads. But we want to allow the consumer to decide. We'll give them opportunities to buy certain things digitally that they may not be able to buy physically \u2013 special digital-only offers. But at the end of the day, we really want to make sure we're allowing the consumer to buy the product wherever the consumer wishes to do that. And we want to make sure we're there. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As it relates to Battlefield 1 and the extra monetization opportunity, taking a step back, anytime we think about extra monetization inside an experience, we really think about it on two vectors. One, are we able to provide value to the gamer in terms of extending and enhancing their experience? And two, are we able to do that in a world where we give them choice? We never want to be in a place where there is a belief that we are providing a pay to win mechanic inside of one of our games. I think what you've seen from us over the last couple of years is our ability to balance this and deliver tremendous value through choice to our player, which is why our extra content line of business has continued to grow healthily. As we look at FY 2017, we are forecasting again continued growth in that category. Given that in Battlefield 1 you will see a both macro monetization opportunities from us like maps and large-scale content as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of game play. And then over time what you will see from us is elements of game play that allow gamers to engage and drive and extend and enhance their experience much the way people will do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today. And we feel very confident in our ability to deliver that in a way that is deemed valuable by our player and drives increasing engagement over time with them Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And then if I could just get one more in, I don't want to front run the Analyst Day too much, but what are the key areas that you really want to spend more time on with investors? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, again, we have been undergoing a fairly fundamental transformation of our business over the last few years. We feel like we're in a very, very strong place. We feel like we have a strong and predictable revenue source and that the company is operating very well right now, and the management team are doing great things in a world where our industry continues to grow. And we want to take the opportunity to share our vision for the future, how we see the industry growing, where we think the vectors for growth exist inside that industry and how we believe Electronic Arts is uniquely well positioned to benefit from those vectors of growth in the years ahead. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Ben, I think part of that, the goal is to make sure we're giving both the sell-side and the buy-side exposure to the broader management team. And the chance to see the depth of what we've developed here as we feel very confident of it, and we're excited to make sure we showcase that next week. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Great quarter. Blake, you gave 25 million units growth for, I think, calendar year 2016. I'm curious if your assumptions, if you were expecting ease of new consoles this year, any price cuts of existing hardware? Or maybe any other sort of key considerations to that estimate? And then, I realize obviously you can't announce any new hardware plans from your partners, but there has been sort of wide speculation that you have a mid-cycle upgrade coming. And I was curious if you could sort of shape for us why a mid-cycle upgrade could be positive for the industry. And also if there is any potential development expense to developing games in 4K. Thanks guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony or other console makers plans are. I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry both through the holidays and post holidays. And there is continued aggressive bundling across the industry. And I think all of that acts to continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is there are very few Gen 3 titles being still made. Most of the new titles that we're talking about as well as the industry is talking about are Gen 4-only, and that is a \u2013 will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they've resisted, because they've had a choice to play a game on either Gen 4 or Gen 4. In terms of any mid-cycle upgrades, once again I can't predict. But what I can tell you is that what was heard I think publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft has shown, they've tried to do with some backward compatibility on to older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a mid-cycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated with what we've seen historically with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it, because we feel like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that's been minimized because we've moved towards one single engine, Frostbite. And we're able to port that to whatever platform or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded. In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been historically, that the notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something at E3 or sometime in the year to come, but we're excited about the continued growth in the business and not afraid of a cycle change if that was to occur. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: All right, thanks, Blake. Best of luck, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : And your next question is from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First, on mobile, we've seen a couple of quarters of very strong mid-teens year-over-year growth. Is the plan there really to focus around the core AAA titles and develop the mobile ecosystem around those games, or can we see some original IP on the mobile front? And then, secondly, with the fairly healthy cash balance, Blake, how do you think about M&A as another way of putting that cash to use? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As it relates to mobile, again, when you have the benefit of the depth and breadth of our portfolio of great brands and IP, in a world where discovery is becoming challenged and the mobile market is increasingly fought with competition, utilization of those brands is certainly a great strength for us. And as you heard us in our prepared comments, we had the most installs of any publisher in calendar year 2015, and a lot of that is driven around the recognition of our brand and our IP and the quality experiences that come as part of those brands. As we look forward, certainly you will see more great experience from us that are based around the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio, but at the same time, like in our console business and our PC business, we also look at opportunities to develop new IP in the space, and so you would expect from us in the future a balanced approach to the marketplace, but certainly, we're not turning our back on our existing portfolio. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of M&A, I think over the last three years, we've gone through quite a transformation as a company, and three years ago we could not have talked about M&A without having most of you throw something at us. And we feel like we've now at least earned the right to talk about it. The reality is there is not a lot of things out there to buy. This is an industry that's fairly consolidated already. We look at everything that's being considered to be sold out there, or shopped. Most of them either we're not interested in or are at a price that doesn't make sense to us to create value for shareholders, but we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to look for ways to bring in new talent and new properties over time if those are an opportunity. But we're certainly listening probably more than we did three years ago and we're well aware of the opportunities out there and we'll continue to look at them. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : With that, I think we're wrapped up. So I want to thank everyone. And we'll see people here next week for earnings \u2013 or for Analyst Day. And if not, we hope to see you at EA Play in June. Thanks for your time. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines been placed on the to prevent background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call over to Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Chris Evenden - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome to EA's fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; Blake Jorgensen, our CFO; and Ken Barker, our Chief Accounting Officer. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at, ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings sides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of the call and a transcript. One quick note on upcoming events. Our Q2 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, November 1. This presentation does contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, August 2, 2016, and disclaims any duty to update them. We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics during this call. However, as discussed on our July 19 conference call, in light of the new interpretations issued by the SEC on May 17, this will be the last call in which we disclose any non-GAAP measures that adjust for deferred revenue. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitution for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. Our first quarter was an excellent start for fiscal year 2017, demonstrating that our digital transformation continues to strengthen and drive growth for Electronic Arts. Revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance as players engaged deeply with their favorite games and connected with each other across a global network of live services. On HD platforms, we have thriving communities in our major franchises, and these will continue to grow as we introduce great new experiences this year. More than 11.5 million people played our Battlefield titles during Q1 and more than 6.6 million played Star Wars Battlefront, two examples that illustrate how great games continue to engage players over time. Looking ahead, there is tremendous excitement for both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, a combination that we believe will bring vitality and innovation to the huge first-person shooter audience. The community has been electrified by Battlefield 1's modern take on World War I, delivering strategy, team play and epic scale in a completely new setting. Titanfall 2 is bringing the game's signature Pilot and Titan combat to a new single-player campaign, and its fast and fluid multiplayer led it to win the Best Online Multiplayer award from the E3 Game Critics. These two titles are driving the variety, progression and fresh new experiences that players want, and we believe they will be an unstoppable pairing during the holiday quarter. Our EA SPORTS titles on console are also seeing massive engagement and players will be thrilled with new ways to play in this year's games. Unique players in Madden NFL grew 20% in Q1 over last year's game. And current and new fans alike will love Madden NFL 17's redesigned Franchise Mode and new competitive tournament, the Madden NFL 17 Championship Series. In our FIFA franchise, millions of soccer fans continue to engage daily with FIFA Ultimate Team, and this year we'll deliver our first-ever Story Mode in FIFA 17. Powered by our Frostbite engine, Story Mode adds an entirely new dimension to the FIFA experience that has fans incredibly excited. And perennial fan-favorite NHL 17 will let hockey fans show their national pride through the all-new World Cup of Hockey Mode. In our mobile business, we are seeing growth across multiple genres. Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes players spent nearly 2.5 hours per day on average in the game, reflecting how much players continue to enjoy the RPG-style combat and in-game community events. In the sports genre, our EA SPORTS mobile titles continue to gain momentum and connect with even more passionate fans. Madden NFL Mobile had 25% more monthly active players in Q1 year-over- year and 37% more game sessions in the same period. We are continuing to invest in great experiences for sports fans across the globe. A new Madden NFL Mobile season is coming soon, NBA LIVE Mobile just launched on iOS and Android and hit number one on the U.S. App Store free download chart and we have a new FIFA mobile game coming later this year. With our focus on groundbreaking new games, dynamic digital experiences and deeper player relationships, EA is innovating to lead our industry. Our new EA PLAY event in June was built on these same principles, inviting our players in and going beyond the typical format to drive a global conversation. Nearly 9,000 fans joined us in Los Angeles and London and millions more connected online to dive deeper into our upcoming games. We livestreamed more than 20 hours of gameplay and competitive gaming events. And more importantly, hundreds of community influencers captured more than 1,400 hours of content from our games to share with the community. Feedback from players that got hands-on at EA PLAY was very positive. And more than ever, we are fulfilling the needs of our players and content creators that connect by sharing great experiences in the games they love to play. We're off to a strong start through Q1 and the year ahead is going to be an exciting one for our players, for Electronic Arts and for our industry. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Andrew. As we discussed on our July 19 call, the SEC has issued new interpretations that no longer permit the use of non-GAAP measures that adjust for revenue deferrals into and out of the quarter. As well as revenue, we've historically adjusted many non-GAAP financial measures for the effect of revenue deferrals, including gross margin and EPS. This is the last call in which we'll report these non-GAAP measures. However, since our board and management team will continue to use these measures internally to manage the business, we will continue to provide the financial data that will allow you to compare our results to our historically reported non-GAAP financials. For more information on this, please see the documents we posted on our Investor Relations website following our July 19 call. Now on to the quarter. Q1 beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Ultimate Team and our mobile game, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.271 billion. This benefited from a change in deferred net revenue of $589 million, resulting in a non-GAAP net revenue of $682 million, well above our guidance of $640 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP net revenue is always the sum of GAAP net revenue and the change in deferred net revenue. The change this quarter is negative; thus non-GAAP net revenue is smaller than GAAP net revenue this quarter. See our earnings documents in July 19 information \u2013 or for more information. GAAP revenue is up year on year, driven by deferrals of Star Wars Battlefront revenue from Q3 fiscal 2016. The underlying business is down slightly year-on-year, but remember, the year-ago quarter benefited from strong catalog sales of Battlefield Hardline, which launched two weeks before the beginning of the quarter. Last year's quarter also included an extra week and a one-off revenue recognition of $31 million for FIFA Online 3 in China. A note here on quarterly comparisons in a GAAP-only reporting environment. Because GAAP revenue is built from a portion of the sales from the quarter plus some of the sales from each of the previous three quarters, a simple year-on-year comparison doesn't reveal much about the dynamics of the underlying business. Because of this, we will restrict ourselves to qualitative comparisons. We will continue to report all the financial data we use internally to adjust our GAAP financials so you may derive comparable measures for yourself. We're also considering adding other metrics that might be used to quantify business trends. We will continue to focus on our most important financial metric, operating cash flow. Our trailing twelve months operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, a record for the period. Capital expenditures for the 12 months were $109 million, delivering a trailing twelve-month free cash flow of $937 million. Our GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter was $689 million, benefiting from a change in deferred revenues of $121 million, resulting in $568 million on a non-GAAP basis. Digital continues to grow as a percentage of the business, and this quarter marked a new high. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free-to-play contributed $300 million to GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $42 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $258 million. As mentioned earlier, the year-ago quarter had a one-off benefit of $31 million from FIFA Online 3 in China. Underlying growth was strong, as FIFA Ultimate Team benefited from the heightened interest in soccer driven by the Euros and Copa America. FIFA Online 3 continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations. Mobile was up strongly year on year, driven by the strength of Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. Mobile generated $165 million in GAAP net revenue in the quarter, benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of $24 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $141 million. Note that under GAAP rules, online-enabled content for mobile games, including in-game currencies, is also recognized ratably over a service period. Full-game PC and console downloads generated $137 million of GAAP net revenue, benefiting from a change in deferred revenue of $53 million. Thus, non-GAAP net revenue was $84 million. Digital downloads were high in the quarter, as expected for a period dominated by catalog sales. Sales growth year on year was flat due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline in Q1 last year. We continue to anticipate that the proportion of games bought digitally will increase by about 5 percentage points this year. Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $87 million to GAAP net revenue. Non-GAAP was $85 million. The underlying business was up, supported by the growth in subscriptions for EA Access and Origin Access. Moving on to gross profit; our GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a gross margin of 85.9%. Remember that GAAP revenue, particularly in Q1, is driven by revenue deferred from prior quarters, whereas cost of goods sold is driven by the volume of sales actually in Q1. You can therefore expect to see some volatility in the quarterly GAAP gross margin as we move through the year. GAAP cost of goods sold was $179 million, which included $13 million of amortization of intangibles and $1 million of stock-based compensation. Therefore, non-GAAP COGS was $165 million and non-GAAP gross profit was $517 million, resulting in a non-GAAP gross margin of 75.8%. This was down 1 percentage point year on year because of the extra FIFA Online 3 revenue recognized in Q1 fiscal 2016. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $532 million, including $47 million of stock-based compensation and $2 million of amortization of intangibles. Thus, non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $483 million. Currency movements actually added to expenses this quarter, as rates were higher for most of the quarter than when we gave guidance, although the British pound in particular fell at the end of the period. Despite the unexpected currency headwinds, underlying expenses were down year on year. The resulting GAAP diluted EPS was $1.40 per share. Adjustments required to derive the non-GAAP EPS include the $589 million change in deferred net revenue, $15 million of amortization of intangibles, $48 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and cost of goods sold, debt-related expenses of $2 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% and a reduction of 2 million shares for the convertible bond hedge which is not included in the GAAP share count. See the example we posted for Q4 fiscal 2016 following our July 19 call for details on how to apply these to derive the non-GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.07 and $0.12 better than our guidance. Outperformance in our digital business drove both top line and profitability higher than we had anticipated this quarter. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.427 billion. 48% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. During Q1 we settled $27 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. We completed repayment of the remaining notes in July. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway is that our diluted share count, whether expressed as GAAP or non-GAAP, already includes the potential dilution at the current share price. We also repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $129 million, leaving $410 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. This is typical for a first quarter. The year-ago quarter was atypical in that it had substantial collections from Battlefield Hardline sales. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $1.05 billion. I wanted to take a moment away from our quarterly results to discuss our FX hedging program in a broader context. We run a global business, with roughly half our revenue coming from outside the U.S. Volatility in exchange rates is still very high by historical standards and macroeconomic events, like the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, are injecting even more uncertainty into the system. A comprehensive hedging program is important in ordinary times, but the extraordinary events of the last year or so made it critical. Our hedging program has two components; one, to reduce volatility in the P&L and a second that does the same for the balance sheet. The first is designed to hedge anticipated revenue and expenses across seven of EA's largest foreign currency exposures. Combined, these seven currencies represent approximately 70% of our non-U.S. dollar operating income. We hedge with forward contracts up to 18 months out. The second covers FX exposure to net monetary assets and liabilities, including third-party accounts receivable and payables as well as intercompany balances. This program aims for 100% coverage of 17 currencies, which account for about 90% of EA's non-U.S. dollar net monetary exposure. We hedge with swaps and forward contracts that generally have a maturity of three months or less. Together, these programs are designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on our business. Turning to guidance, we're excited about the expanded Franchise Mode in Madden NFL 17 and by the FIFA story mode powered by Frostbite. We expect our second quarter GAAP net revenue to be $915 million. This includes a headwind from the anticipated change in deferred net revenue of $160 million. Note that this is an increase in deferred net revenue, thus we expect the non-GAAP measures we would have reported under our previous approach to be higher than the GAAP net revenue in Q2. In other words, you need to add GAAP revenue of $915 million to deferred net revenue of $160 million to arrive at the comparable non-GAAP numbers in your model. With regards to year-on-year comparison, remember FIFA 17 will launch four days before the end of the quarter as opposed to the 11 days FIFA 16 had in the quarter last year. This means very little of the digital revenue associated with FIFA 17 for full-game downloads and FIFA Ultimate Team can be recognized in the quarter. We estimate that absent changes in deferred revenue, about $75 million of high-margin mostly digital sales are pushed into Q3. We anticipate a currency headwind to add to the year-on-year comparisons, and this is factored into our outlook for revenue and change in deferred revenue. Our expectations of currency impact on the whole year have not changed. Cost of goods sold during the quarter is expected to be $405 million, including $13 million of amortization of intangibles. Rather than guide GAAP gross margins, which can be highly volatile from quarter to quarter due to revenue deferrals, we believe that guiding COGS will give you a better insight into our business. With GAAP net revenue, the change in deferred net revenue in COGS, you can calculate both GAAP gross margins and a gross margin comparable to the non-GAAP measures we have given in the past. We expect our Q2 GAAP operating expenses to be $566 million, including about $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in amortization of intangibles. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D. This results in a GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.17. As mentioned earlier, this is driven by costs associated with the major sports launches being recognized within the quarter, but much of the revenue being deferred out of the quarter. Adjustments required to derive the non-GAAP EPS include $160 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and COGS, $14 million in amortization of intangibles and a reduction of 2 million shares from the convertible bond hedge. Debt-related expenses are expected to be below $1 million this quarter. With regard to the underlying business, we would expect it to be down slightly year on year, driven by the roughly $75 million of FIFA sales that has moved to Q3. We are not changing our annual outlook for revenue and net income at this time. EA Play and the response at E3 was very positive, but it's too early to attempt to extrapolate from that to full-year results, particularly in a fiscal year that is expected to be so back-end loaded. We are updating our GAAP diluted share count for the year to $316 million, primarily based on the repurchase activity in the first quarter. This increases the GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to $2.56 for the year. It remains our practice to not factor in potential repurchases into our forecasted share count for the full year. Regarding cash flow for the full year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.2 billion. The ongoing strength of our live services and the reception to our upcoming launches bodes well for the rest of the year. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Blake. Our industry has never been more vibrant and full of opportunity. Games are a global phenomenon. Digital is unlocking more growth and reducing barriers for the next billion players who experience games through new platforms, new ways to play and new business models. In this world, discovery and connection are critical. We are building our EA Player Network to connect more players through games and deliver fresh, engaging experiences every time they play. From single cross-platform identity profiles to more intuitive user interfaces and recommendation engines that help you find friends and get into the action faster, the Player Network will enable new ways to engage in-game and beyond. In our crowd, competitive and multiplatform world, EA is working to connect more players with each other through the games they want to play. Games should be extraordinary. With each game we make, we work to push the boundaries with creativity, technology and new ways to play. Our Frostbite engine is powering more of our biggest games and becoming a true differentiator, scaling across FIFA, Battlefield, Mass Effect and more to deliver stunning gameplay, incredible depth and entirely new modes. And mobile games from EA SPORTS to The Sims to Star Wars are tapping into the passion of our players and offering captivating ways to engage no matter where you are. Across our studios and labs teams, we're developing new types of games and breakthrough capabilities. From immersive and authentic VR experiences to new technologies that transform how we connect, we are constantly in pursuit of the next amazing thing for our players. Games also bring us together. Each day, millions of players connect through our live services, and this year, we'll bring even more ways to engage, including competitions accessible to all our players. In two weeks, tens of thousands of players will join us again to come to play our upcoming titles like Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, and FIFA 17. Many more will watch the content streamed online from Cologne, joining the excitement and conversation about the games they love that are launching in the weeks and months ahead. With every game session, every social conversation and every connection between our players, we are building a powerful global community. We have outstanding new titles to launch in Q2 and much more to come through the rest of the year. Now Blake, Ken and I are here for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks. Just wondering if you can share anything about NBA this year and what will change versus years past and whether you think launching off-calendar will meaningfully impact its prospects? And secondarily, is the Q4 launch of NBA, is that going to be the rule of thumb on a go-forward basis, or will you look to get this back on the calendar? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So first off, as we think about NBA and we think about captivating a global fan base with NBA, we're very, very excited about what we just launched with NBA Live on mobile. As we said in the prepared remarks, it quickly went to number one in the free downloads and it's been performing extremely well. Engagement is high and better in terms of metrics across the board than we could've expected and better in terms of metrics than many of our other sports games so far. So that leads us to believe that we have an exciting opportunity with NBA and an exciting opportunity with sports on mobile all together. The broader NBA plans, we don't have anything more to announce right now other than the team continues to work diligently on ensuring that we are delivering great NBA experiences on any and all devices that fans want to play on. And we believe that, as we are able to announce more around our plans, that it will be very exciting for fans across all devices. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Next question? Operator : And our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. Can you help us at all with your Battlefield expectations in your guidance and whether you've changed those at all post E3? And then you are buying back quite a bit of stock, but you have a lot of SBC. Now that you're going to GAAP, do you think you can lower SBC? And as you do buybacks, do you think you can really lower that share count over time? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, let me hit both of those, Justin. First, we were very pleased at the reaction of players at our EA Play. I think you got a chance to play it yourself. It's been very, very popular, and the feedback has been extremely strong. We tend not to try to raise guidance too early in the year. We would like to see a little more demand metrics on all of our products, particularly Battlefield and Titanfall, before we make that decision. Gamescom is a very important beat that's coming up in a couple of weeks in Europe, and then obviously the potential for betas around those products will help us derive better demand metrics. Last year, if you remember, we did raise guidance coming out of the first quarter because our initial forecast on Battlefront, the Star Wars title, was relatively low, and we moved that up. We've got a fairly normal forecast for Battlefield and Titanfall, so we're not moving those yet, but we're still super optimistic about the titles. I'm very excited. So, more to come in the future. But we felt it was just too early in the year to try to move guidance on any of the titles going forward. On the share count piece, we have been over time bringing down stock-based compensation. With an important part of the overall compensation, we feel it's important as part of our employees and executives to bear some of the risks of the stockholders. And having your compensation as part of that is critical. But we also recognize that we need to bring all compensation down over time to continue to be profitable as a company. We balance that with the requirements of attracting the greatest people that we can in the industry, and we feel like that mix is a pretty good mix today. But we will obviously be trying to drive down the share count between a combination of managing aggressive buybacks as well as prudent management of our overall compensation pool. Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could describe overall trends with (28:29-28:37)... Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, Colin? Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah? Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Colin, we're having a hard time hearing you. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Can you hear me now? Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): The first question was describing trends you're seeing in attach rates for catalog titles, and that's just as a measure of the progress of comps in the cycle. And then secondly, I was hoping for just a clarification or update on the multi-year framework for revenue growth that you laid out at the Analyst Day. I believe you initially indicated an incremental $1 billion in revenue over two to three years. I wonder if you look through the pipeline and the progress you're making, how much of that potential there could be to that framework. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So on attach rates, we're continuing to be excited about the growth of the overall console business. And I think the plans that were announced at E3 around both Xbox and PlayStation were viewed in the industry as very positive. I think moving beyond the notion of \u2013 or jumping into the compatibility issue head-on and trying to stop the notion of having consoles that are not compatible will help the software side of the equation dramatically over time, and I think that's a big plus. We continue to believe that we'll see upside in the number of consoles sold this year. And the software attach rates stayed pretty consistent with what we've seen up through the cycle so far. And so all of that I think bodes well for the overall cycle and should continue to help us drive upside. Now on the revenue growth, the numbers I laid out at the Analyst Day were basically, if you take our year-end fiscal 2016 results and you look out over the 2020 to 2022 timeframe, we believe that we could add another $1.5 billion of revenue from areas such as genre growth, moving into the action genre, continuing to grow our mobile business, continuing to grow our business in Asia and other parts of the emerging markets around the world. And we believe that could then continue to drive free cash flow growth and earnings growth. And $1.5 billion of additional revenue should be able to drive $1 billion in operating income and just under $1 billion in free cash flow growth during that time. Obviously those are all non-GAAP numbers, so. And we feel confident about the progress that we're making there. Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wonder if you guys could comment on the timing of FIFA Mobile, what your expectations are. And I believe your guidance for mobile for the year was 15%. I know that's on a non-GAAP basis, but it looks like you're off to a very good start for fiscal 2017. Any update on expectations for mobile as a whole? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll take that. Thanks, Drew. So a couple of things. One is, mobile is going strong for us. We're seeing growth in the mobile market that is outpacing some of our early expectations for the broader industry. Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes continues to perform well. Madden NFL continues to perform well, even in the off-season. And with the football season just around the corner, we expect that that will once again ramp. Our broader catalog of SimCity and The Sims and Need for Speed and Real Racing also continue to perform very well. As I said earlier, we just launched NBA Live Mobile. We launched that well in advance of the season to ensure a good and strong ramp both of the game design, the architecture and the infrastructure. And with a lot of basketball happening still with the summer season and a certain competitive sports event going on in Rio over the next couple of weeks, we believe it's a great opportunity to start to ramp our NBA business on mobile, and it's performing extremely well. And follows a similar design and modality of play to what we have learned \u2013 engages fans to the highest degree around Madden. As we've talked about before, we're also looking to do that with FIFA. And as with all of our sports games, we typically launch them at the outset or early in the season. And right now we're on track to launch our FIFA mobile property early in the European football season, which would align perfectly with the ramp of the fan base at that time. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the questions. On Madden, with unique players up 20% and mobile players up 25%, can you discuss what is driving this user growth and what role Ultimate Team is actually playing here? And then on mobile, with Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes at the top of the charts, just wondering if you could comment on monetization on a per-user basis relative to other EA mobile titles. And looking at that averaged 2.5 hours per day of playtime, what's the durability of a game like that? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll grab the first half and I'll let Blake take the second half. As it relates to our broader Madden community, again, the fan base of the NFL continues to grow. It's a great league. It's a sport that's very, very important to the population of North America and even growing internationally right now in Europe and Mexico and other parts of the world. Our Madden development teams have been very, very focused on a couple of vectors over the last couple of years. And you've seen this kind of manifest in both console and mobile as we've come forward. The first is about how do we bring on new players and then how do we keep players engaged over time. And, of course, quality is at the very core of that, but on-boarding, user interface, tutorials, training, things that really ignite the passion for new players and get them into the Madden community and playing and competing for the love of the sport as well as providing ongoing innovation and live services and ongoing community-based events that keeps our long-term fans and our long-time fans more deeply engaged. You're going to continue to see this across both Madden and our sports games and our broader portfolio. The global player community continues to grow. Mobile brings players in. Many of those players choose other modalities of play, like console. We see it as our objective to continue to deliver great experiences to new fans as well as meaningful and long-term engagement in live services to our long-time fans. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think on Galaxy of Heroes, what makes a great game is a deep engagement model, some reason for people to come back to enjoy something each day or each week. And we've cracked that code, we believe, inside of the console base. Ultimate Team, as you are all well aware of, it's a deeply engaging way to enjoy the sports you love as well as the video game you love. That same mechanic can work well inside of a mobile game, not just in sports, but also in games that we're proving with Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. It's event driven; activities, new things, new characters, new ways to play that are constantly brought into the game that keeps people coming back and keeps the level of that engagement at the height that you're seeing. We think that's very sustainable because you're able to continue to add activities. In the sports world, it works well because you're dealing with the real world sport all the time. But in the fantasy world, it's even better because you don't have the limits that you have in the real world. And so our goal is to continue to add new exciting context, ways to play, characters, enjoyment in the games that will keep them alive for many years to come and I think obviously keeps them monetizing over time. Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you. I just had a couple, and apologies if this was covered. Just in terms of the Player Network, I was just trying to get a sense of where you are in rolling that out, and to what extent we actually saw the benefit of that in the Ultimate Team result that you delivered this quarter? And then should we see maybe even more of an impact later in the year as it relates to your marketing costs as you roll out the big first-person shooters? And then just a second question on the mobile business; just wondering if there's any impact that you saw from Pok\u00e9mon GO in the quarter. Augmented reality turned out to be this huge mass market feature that people really like. So do you have any plans to integrate augmented reality into your mobile games? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So on the Player Network, you're going to hear a lot more about this from us. As we look to the future, as we think about where games are going, we see some fundamental problems arising if you are a gamer. So in a world where gamers are playing more games across more devices through more business models in more geographies than ever before, the concept as a player of always being able to stay connected to your friends and always being able to stay connected to the games you love, irrespective of what device you play on, is going to be an important problem to solve. We believe that the investment that we've been making, our core digital platform, with an ID that travels with you across devices with a single data infrastructure that allows us to always understand the full 360-degree view of you as a player and all of the services that are built on top of that, that allow you to connect with your friends across devices, is going to be an imperative part of our future. What you're starting to see now is this lineup inside of \u2013 across our console games, across our mobile games. We're making tremendous headway. That means no matter where you play, you can remain connected to your friends. If you move from iOS to Android and you are using our ID system, you do not lose your game progress. As you start to think about the communities that we build and connecting with those communities, particularly in things like Ultimate Team, we're seeing tremendous engagement where we are able to deliver you, by virtue of this Player Network, experiences that are personal, contextual and meaningful to you and your friends. We're seeing that the engagement improve dramatically and we're that seeing that players are opting into more and more of our games because we are finding a way to present them with opportunities that are meaningful and personal for them. You're going to see more and more of this in the future. We expect that it will continue to become a powerful tool in how we engage with players, but as importantly, how players engage with each other. And in the broader network world that we now live in, the power of our network will be directly proportional to the number of players inside the network and the strength of connections between the players inside that network. And a lot of what we are doing as it relates our core digital platform development, our single engine development and our broader portfolio of game development is all in service of manifesting the strength in that network. As it relates to Pok\u00e9mon GO, great question. First, as a comment, I think that what that team has done is very, very strong. It's a great blend of an IP that we have known and loved for the best part of 20 years and a new technology that introduces that to a new audience through mobile devices. What you've heard from us is that we have been working on both VR and AR for some time. We have made some announcements around VR in mobile and on console with PlayStation VR, and we're going to continue to invest there. As you can imagine, we are energized by the success of Pok\u00e9mon GO. We have tremendously strong brands that are unbelievably social in nature, where we believe that the participation at a community level through AR will just heighten that experience. And we have been working on some things for some time and we'll continue to work on those, and we'll be ready to launch them at a time where we think we can better engage communities through AR. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Chris, Pok\u00e9mon really came out after our quarter ended and, in a broader sense, in global rollout. But if we look at the daily revenue trends even after it's come out, we haven't seen much impact. I think it's brought in a lot of new game players and a lot of people have been involved with it, but it hasn't really detracted from any revenue that we're seeing in our regular mobile games. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one big picture and one on the Star Wars franchise. Big picture question, Andrew. Would love your thoughts on how we should be thinking about the publisher community and how it's going to approach the console upgrade or mid-cycle console upgrade cycle, however you'd like to frame it, that we're going to see from Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo over the next 12 months, plus or minus, how you're preparing for that, what that might mean in terms of going to market, making consumers aware of your titles and managing through that transition. And then on Star Wars, we saw the announcement at Star Wars Celebration. It looked as if the expansion pack this year is going to be more tightly intertwined with the actual movie content that comes out in December. What might that mean for the breadth of the platform going forward as well as maybe even marketing efficiencies, since the content could be so tied closely with the movie? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So on the first question, at a macro level, we're excited about what Sony and Microsoft have announced. The reality for us is, again, in a networked world, liquidity of players is really, really important. And what we've seen over the last decade or more with respect to PC gamers is that community has continued to grow and it has grown a world where the hardware refresh cycle has been disconnected from the software refresh cycle. And what that's meant is that irrespective of what kind of device you have within kind of a seven to 10-year timeframe, you're able to play with a much, much bigger global community. What we see now with the things that have been talked about with the mid-cycle refresh is that only going to enhance the size and engagement levels inside the communities. For us as a publisher, we're in a very strong place. We've been building across platform and across console and for scalable architectures like PC for some time. So the notion that we would build once an experience that can scale up and down across an entire spectrum of consoles, whether the first phase, the second phase or the third phase over time is not something that's foreign to us and something that we're very energized about because, again, I think we have strength in a networked world and we have strength where there is a requirement to build these scaled experiences that keep players connected. So on balance, we think this is great for the industry. It will almost certainly extend the console cycle almost to an infinite level if we get to a point where there's just constant hardware upgrades and constant software upgrades but we are able through the scaling of our games to keep the community always together. More broadly thinking about the Star Wars franchise, again, this is a long-term play for us. We're very excited. We were overjoyed with the performance of Star Wars Battlefront. We're overjoyed with the 6.6 million players that played the game through Q1. We're continuing to support that. As each movie comes out over the time of our relationship, we expect that the Star Wars community will continue to grow and we will be doing our best to align, in some cases, the content and experiences and, in some cases, just the passion for Star Wars. But certainly aligning what we're doing around the Star Wars universe with what's more broadly happening with Star Wars pop culture. And we think that's a win as we continue to live up to the fans long term. Chris Evenden - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hey, everybody. I had two question. You mentioned earlier that you haven't changed your assumptions that are built into guidance for Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. I don't recall if you provided what kind of unit expectations you have for those titles. Is that something that you would be willing to share or share again if you have already talked about it? And then secondly, do you anticipate any Olympics-related distraction that could impact player engagement over the next month or so? Have you ever seen anything from Olympics in the past? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the guidance, we've talked rough numbers with people. We've told people that typically a Battlefield title does about 15 million in a year. Our guidance is slightly under that. And we hope that that excitement builds and it will clearly go through that number. But for right now, it's slightly under that number. And Titanfall did a little more than 7 million units last time. It was early in the cycle and one of the few titles out there. We think it'll do more than that, but it's probably closer to 10 million than it is to 15 million as built into our guidance. So closer to 9 million to 10 million on Titanfall and just under 15 million on Battlefield 1. In terms of the Olympics, Andrew can probably jump in here. But I think oftentimes, if there are sports going on that we have games associated with, there's a lot of positive. As you see with the FIFA Ultimate Team, numbers relative to the Euro and the Copa America. We didn't have programs directly linked to those, but people engage in those because their favorite players are playing on new teams or in new tournaments and that drives them in. So I think in general, athletics bring people back to athletics. If they're watching on TV, they're oftentimes going to try to imitate that somewhere else and that may benefit some of our games. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks a lot for taking my question. Just looking at your extra content free-to-play line in digital, obviously your biggest segment within digital, growth in 1Q was just a little more than 1%. That's your slowest growth quarter I think ever since you started putting out those metrics. Was there anything specific that \u2013 was it timing of just the releases that drove that number so below average? Or was there something unique there? And how do you see that playing out over the rest of the year? Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so you're referring to growth in extra content? Is that what you're saying? Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Yes, Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so growth in extra content is really masked by the fact that we last year in the quarter had a $30 million deferral of... Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Oh, that's right. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : FIFA Online 3 revenue that popped all in Q3. So if you take that out, you saw strong growth in extra content. Clearly, if you look at the underlying growth of Ultimate Team, you're continuing to see extremely strong growth in Ultimate Team led by FIFA across the full Ultimate Team spectrum. And so we are pretty confident that our guidance for the full year of 10% growth of extra content will be on track and we should easily be able to see that over time. Similar dynamic and full game downloads, it was flat year-over-year. But almost all of that flat was driven by the fact that in Q1 last year, we had a huge amount of sales on Battlefield Hardline, a very large title. We didn't have a similar large title. Obviously we had one title in the quarter, Mirror's Edge, but a much smaller title than the comparison as Battlefield Hardline last year. So we're very confident that the digital growth is continuing and just cautioning people to always make sure they look at drivers of the underlying \u2013 understand the underlying component. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Much appreciated, Blake. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys. A few questions. First, just broadly on retail. As you move to more digital full game downloads, can you just broadly discuss how it's impacting relationships with the key retailers, how that will evolve over time? And then secondly, PlayStation VR likely to first (49:47) more mass market VR product to come to market? What is that going mean for the industry overall? Obviously, it's going to be pretty small numbers this year, likely (49:57). But does the interest in that mean anything for the industry broadly? And then finally, on the U.K., historically first-person shooters have actually been geared very much to the U.K. and U.S. With all the issues that are going on in the U.K., do you think that's going impact anything at all for Titanfall and Battlefield and potentially FIFA? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So why don't I just hit the piece on the U.K. real quick. So we're hedged through \u2013 out 18 months. Those hedges are not 100% each quarter, as they decline over time, but we're well hedged for the rest of this year, so we don't see more FX headwind that would impact the sales of FIFA or Battlefield or Titanfall. We also don't see any changes in the Brexit driving changing in people's desire to play video games. So we don't see an impact there. Do you want to touch on the VR piece? Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so on PlayStation VR, again, we're very excited about this. I think to your point, given its price point and modality of play, it's one of the more accessible forms of virtual reality play right now. We've got a great experience coming later in the year that I've played and it's super fun and super exciting. I think that part of the reason people play games is to kind of immerse themselves in a fantasy and escape and fulfill these fantasies with their friends. Particularly when we design games, we design them on a big screen TV and we have to overcome, as designers, this spatial disconnect between us and the television. Of course virtual reality, we don't have to overcome that spatial disconnect. So the more that we can introduce people to low barrier to entry virtual reality, I think the faster it's going to take off as an industry. And so us as a company, we're looking at how we can invest across all elements of the spectrum from the mobile elements right up to the high-end elements. And PlayStation VR I think is going to be a great step in the evolution of our industry and the evolution of how people play games and we're going to continue to invest there. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then on the retail question, we have, we believe, strong relationships with a whole set of global retailers around the world, some large, some small. We try to maintain those and we try to build a dual strategy where we're pushing digital but we're also using the retailers for what the retailers are really good about, which is marketing and really pushing out the information about the games and the excitement around the games. We're always going to have that as a dual strategy. We believe the retailers will be around for a long period of time and are important in our system and we try to have a fine balance there. We try to help the retailers be involved in some of the digital business where they can, and just maintain a strong business for them as well as continuing to grow our business, both digitally and physically. Next question? Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, Andrew and Blake. Great quarter, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in the question-and-answer here. I'm curious \u2013 two questions, one on FIFA 17 on the Story Mode, who the incremental player is there that you think will show up and if you fear at all there could be any sort of pressure on Ultimate Team and I guess Story Mode cannibalizing Ultimate Team to some level? And second question, any visibility on fiscal 2018? At least on the surface \u2013 obviously we're Q1 2017, so it's quite a ways away, but on the surface it looks like the environment could be a bit challenging at least in driving sales growth and how you think about maybe M&A as a potential driver for fiscal 2018 growth? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me touch on the FIFA piece, and then I'll let Blake take on FY 2018. As we think about our global community of gamers, again, FIFA is one of the biggest games on the planet. It attracts a very diverse playing population : old, young, male, female, east, west. And we are always looking at delivering new and innovative experiences for our FIFA players. We still expect that FIFA Ultimate Team will be the most engaging mode in the game. Year-on-year our players tell us that it's the most exciting way to play FIFA and the most interesting way and fulfills their fantasy of really building the ultimate team and taking that team and competing with their friends. But with that said, we also understand that as a new player coming into FIFA that may be a little daunting. And so we see Story Mode as not just a new way for existing fans to play, but actually a great on-boarding mode. Again, every kid in every country around the world that follows soccer or football dreams of that opportunity to get called up to the first division in their country. And we believe that fantasy is something that's very compelling, and we believe the mode overall will be a great on-boarder for new players and ultimately help them understand the beauty of football, the beauty of FIFA as an interactive game experience and help move them into the broader FIFA community where they will likely engage with the tens of millions of people every year in FIFA Ultimate Team. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, remember still just a little bit more than 50% of all people who buy FIFA actually engage in Ultimate Team. We see that as a huge opportunity to bring more people into Ultimate Team. And there are many people that don't understand how the soccer system might work or works around players and development of players, which is critical to the foundation of Ultimate Team. And so we believe this is a way to continue to bring people into that. On the fiscal 2018, we're obviously not prepared to give guidance yet on 2018 anything more than we've already said in the past. We're excited and hard at work at the next Star Wars Battlefront title. We've got a couple of great new opportunities coming that we haven't yet announced that we'll give you more insight on. We've got some great things going on in mobile. We're excited about the continued growth of the FIFA franchise and Madden franchise, NHL, NBA franchise, and leveraging mobile in all of those cases. And I think the one thing to remind people of that oftentimes gets forgotten, is to the extent that we have a very successful Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 launch, those will be a big benefit to next year's plan. Just as you're seeing now, we still have 11 million people engaging in Battlefield 4. And so that Battlefield world is incredibly important; the Star Wars world, the same way. We'll continue to leverage that as we drive through 2017 and into 2018 and 2019. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Given the increasing engagement on the mobile side as well as on the console side, have you guys thought about getting more aggressive in terms of advertising as a way to get players to pay more as well as to play more? And then on the international side, it looks like international as a percent of revenue jumped to about 59%. It's been higher than it has been in the past couple of quarters. Any color in terms of titles and/or regions that drove that growth? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on mobile advertising, we do a little under $100 million in mobile advertising. We try to steer \u2013 we try to do a couple things. We try to keep people in our networks, so steer them to other games in our network, which is powerful. That doesn't make us money, it just keeps people in the network. And, two, the next piece is we might tend to show people advertising if they're not monetizing in other ways. What I will tell you is because most of mobile game use is anonymous, it's hard to collect data on your mobile users. That means the value of that advertising or the CPMs are fairly low and thus the reason it's less than $100 million for us even though we have a large mobile network. We'll continue to experiment with that and we'll continue to look at it, but we don't see that as a giant revenue growth opportunity for us at this point in time. On the international piece, I think some of it's simply driven by the strength of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team. Much of FIFA's marketplace is international, particularly Europe. And as that business continues to get stronger, you're going to see that skewing, particularly in a quarter where FIFA Team is so important where there's not as many new releases that'll skew the revenue to the international. One last question? Operator : And our final question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks. I'm going to get way down in the weeds here. There was a story towards the end of the quarter that your in-form players weren't interacting correctly with the chemistry mechanic in FIFA Ultimate Team. It's one of those things you see on Reddit. Has that had any impact on Ultimate Team monetization as you got into the September quarter? And do you feel like you have your arms around getting the mechanics fixed and making sure the player base is happy with the outcome? Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, so that is getting in the weeds a little bit, but I'm happy to have a conversation about it. So as with any live service, there are times where we find bugs in the software. We stayed very, very close to the community, again, engagement of our community. Ensuring our community has the utmost and highest experience when playing our games is very, very important to us. And so what I'm happy to say is the team was very close, they heard that feedback from the community. They rallied very quickly, the found the bug. They fixed the bug and deployed a fix very, very quickly and were very transparent and open with the community throughout every step of the way. As a result of that, we didn't see any impact to the engagement or the broader interaction with the mode, and quite the opposite. I think what we found was the community deeply appreciated that we were connected with them, that we were listening to them, that we acted quickly, transparently and openly and we solved the problem going forward. As we think about our live services future, this is really how we need to operate as a business. We won't always get the code exactly right, but it's as much about how we operate when we don't quite get it right as it is about when we do. And the commitment we make to gamers is to be very open and transparent with them, to listen to them and always working diligently to deliver the best experience possible. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Andrew. Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : With that, I think we'll end the call. I do appreciate everyone's patience around the GAAP to non-GAAP transition that we're making. I encourage everyone to dig in to make sure that you and the rest of your investors understand what the real numbers are because we have already started to see some disconnects between people who don't understand it. So appreciate everyone here on the call communicating the right numbers to people and helping us make this transition. So we'll talk to everyone next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Electronic Arts delivered excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, powered by a slate of the most advanced and innovative new EA SPORTS titles that we have ever delivered. We're thrilled with the quality and player excitement for the new games we launched in Q2 and even more excited for the exceptional titles we launched in Q3. As a result, we're raising our full-year guidance for FY 2017. More than 43 million players engaged in our breakthrough EA SPORTS games across consoles and mobile devices during Q2. On console, FIFA 17 has given soccer fans around the world a revolutionary new experience, powered by our Frostbite engine. We introduced The Journey, FIFA's first-ever story mode, which helped bring 20% more players into FIFA 17 in the first week over last year's game. To date, nearly 2/3 of all FIFA 17 players, spanning 183 countries, have engaged in this critically acclaimed new addition to the game. The FIFA Ultimate Team [FUT] experience is more robust than ever in FIFA 17, and engagement continues to grow through new modes and global competition. Players in the FUT Champions mode are now competing to advance to our live tournament events, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series. Madden NFL 17 players spent more time in the game in Q2 than any previous Madden title in the last five years, logging 44 million gameplay hours during the quarter. Ultimate Team [MUT] also continues to grow in Madden NFL, with engaged players in MUT up nearly 20% year over year in Q2. Our Madden NFL competitive gaming season also kicked off in Q2 with the Madden Classic, the first of four EA Major live events in the Madden NFL Championship Series. 1.5 million fans played 5.8 million ranked games in the online qualifying rounds, and the top 16 players will compete for the Madden Classic championship in Los Angeles in early December. The holidays are always a great season for football, and we're looking forward to more passion and engagement from our Madden NFL community in the months ahead. EA SPORTS has been a leader in high-quality and immersive sports games across multiple platforms, and now we're delivering on that promise for mobile players as well. We now have top-performing mobile titles across three of our major sports franchises. Madden NFL Mobile continues to grow year over year in both unique players and sessions per day. NBA LIVE Mobile has brought in more players than Madden NFL Mobile did during its launch period. And FIFA Mobile hit number one in the App Store Free Games chart in 138 countries just after its early Q3 launch. Each of these experiences are long-term live services that will continue to grow and be tuned with the expanding player base in this high-growth genre. Strength in our mobile portfolio reaches across other key genres. Our action RPG, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, continues to drive strong levels of engagement, with average gameplay per player holding at 2.5 hours per day in Q2, one of the highest totals we've seen in a mobile game. Our deep roster of live services on mobile, including The Sims FreePlay, SimCity BuildIt, and Real Racing 3 continue to deliver long-lasting entertainment. Mobile players today expect increasing levels of creativity, depth, and polish in the games they play, and as a result only a few titles will break out. With decades of rich experience building high-quality and immersive games, a portfolio of leading titles, and a strong pipeline of new projects, we are well positioned for this evolution in mobile. Throughout Q2, the energy around our two groundbreaking first-person shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, continued to build in anticipation of their Q3 launches. Battlefield 1 has impressed at every turn. From the debut trailer to subsequent looks at gameplay, features, and single-player stories, our Battlefield 1 content has over 100 million video views on YouTube, a record level for any EA game. Community influencers shared hundreds of hours of gameplay captured from play sessions around the world, bringing the world of Battlefield 1 to life in unprecedented depth. DICE has redefined the shooter genre with Battlefield 1, which now stands as the most highly rated Battlefield game of this generation. Player engagement since launch on October 21 has been phenomenal. Battlefield 1's total player base for the first week was nearly double that of Battlefield 4. Respawn has cemented Titanfall's position as one of the most exciting new IPs in the industry, with the bold vision and exhilarating action of Titanfall 2. This is a game that feels incredibly fluid and fulfilling to play. Critics agree that Titanfall 2 is a fantastic game, with more than 40 top outlets from around the world rating it 90 and above in reviews. The thrill of multiplayer in Titanfall 2 has the community buzzing, and rave reviews are also coming for the campaign that adds purpose and depth to the experience. Titanfall 2 is being called one of the year's must-play titles, and we're excited to see more fans across the world getting their hands on this extraordinary game. Heading into the holiday season that will include updated consoles and more mobile devices, Electronic Arts is in an outstanding position. With Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we now have two of the top-rated shooter games of this console generation engaging a broad audience of players. Our EA SPORTS titles are delivering excitement for fans with thrilling new gameplay, challenges in Ultimate Team, and dozens of new competitive gaming tournaments from the community level to the global stage. Our mobile portfolio has a game for every player, with Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, and more. And we will also deliver our first virtual reality experiences this holiday with the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One : X-wing VR Mission for PlayStation VR and Need for Speed No Limits on Daydream, Google's VR platform. We're looking forward to another strong quarter ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to describe the steps we are taking to improve transparency in our new GAAP-only reporting environment. As we mentioned on our Q1 earnings call, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP metrics, but will provide you with all the GAAP data you need to derive metrics comparable to our historical reported non-GAAP financials. In addition, to give more visibility into the performance of our business, we have decided to add a new operating performance metric, net sales. We define net sales as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Historical net sales have been added to our downloadable model posted on our website. In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with our historical non-GAAP results. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure to discuss the dynamics of our business. We are very pleased with the strong second quarter, in particular the great reception for FIFA 17 and the strength of our mobile portfolio. EA's GAAP net revenue was $898 million, compared to $815 million last year. Net revenue was below our guidance by $17 million. However, the change in deferred net revenue was $40 million above our guidance at $200 million. If you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add GAAP revenue of $898 million to the change in deferred net revenue of $200 million. Thus, although underlying sales were above our expectations, because GAAP revenue is subject to the sales timing within the quarter, a larger portion of the total sales were deferred into future quarters. The increase over last year's net revenue was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 fiscal 2016 compared to smaller launches in Q3 fiscal 2015. See the document we posted on our Investor Relations website on July 19 for details on how to compare these results to historically reported non-GAAP results. Our cost of revenue was $401 million, including acquisition-related expenses of $12 million and $1 million worth of stock-based compensation. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.3%, up 5.5 percentage points over last year. This reflects the strength of Star Wars Battlefront three quarters ago, in Q3 fiscal 2016. As I just mentioned, revenue deferred from Star Wars Battlefront drove higher GAAP revenues in Q2 fiscal 2017 compared to the revenue deferrals from smaller titles launched in Q3 fiscal 2015. However, the cost of revenues this Q2 and last year's Q2 were approximately the same, given that the respective launch slates were similar. Thus, GAAP gross margin was up year on year. Operating expenses were $546 million, up $21 million or 4% year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D, particularly in new franchises and in our new Player Network infrastructure. The $20 million improvement on guidance was driven by timing of marketing activity. The $546 million includes $47 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses. The resulting loss per share was $0.13, which is $0.04 better than our guidance due to lower costs. It is $0.32 better than last year. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include : the $200 million change in deferred net revenue; $13 million acquisition-related expenses; $48 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and the cost of revenue; and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that given our GAAP result was a loss, our share count was 301 million shares, as GAAP requires us to exclude the estimated 13 million shares that might be issued in the future, such as the shares expected to be issued this quarter for the settlement of the warrants. Those shares would be included in the diluted share count had we reported a profit. Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $109 million, up $100 million on last year. For the trailing twelve months it was $1.1 billion. With capital expenditures of $120 million, free cash flow was $1 billion in the same period. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During Q2, we settled the remaining $136 million of our convertible notes. As a reminder, the warrants issued with our convertible notes are still outstanding, and starting on October 17 began to exercise automatically over 60 trading days. We have posted a document on our website that explains the impact on our share count. The most important takeaway remains that our diluted share count already includes the potential dilution at the current share price. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $282 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.27 billion. Forty-three percent of this balance is held onshore. This is down from 48% last quarter, the difference driven primarily by the share repurchase and convertible notes settlement. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion better than our expectations. Sales were driven by successful sports launches and growth in mobile. As discussed on our last call, FIFA 17 launched only four days from the end of the quarter. So almost no digital sales, whether downloads or Ultimate Team, were captured in the quarter. FIFA 16 launched 11 days before the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, allowing a whole week of digital sales to be captured. Using the first four weeks of sales to make a true like-for-like comparison shows that FIFA sell-through is up 13% year on year, and this speaks to how The Journey story mode has grown the market for our biggest franchise. Digital net sales were $486 million, up $6 million on the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in mobile and in digital downloads, offset by the FIFA timing I just mentioned. The long-term trend towards digital is clear in net sales for the last twelve months, which were $2.6 billion or 57% of the total. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net sales in turn, extra content and freemium net sales were down nearly 12% year on year to $172 million, driven by the fact almost all of the first week of FIFA digital sales will be captured in Q3 of this year. Using the first four weeks of Ultimate Team sales for FIFA 17 and FIFA 16 reveals year-on-year growth of 23%, even in the face of ongoing currency headwinds. Mobile net sales were $138 million in the quarter, up 22% year on year, with growth led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. We launched NBA LIVE Mobile in July and FIFA Mobile after the quarter end, and early indications from both titles are promising. Net sales for full-game PC and console downloads were $93 million, up 4.5% over last year, and in line with our expectations. Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital purchases contributed $83 million to net sales, flat year on year. Strong growth in EA Access and Origin Access were offset by declining revenue from some older titles. Now turning to guidance, we are raising our full-year guidance to $4.775 billion in net revenue and a $150 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.387 billion, including $31 million of acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation. Operating expenses are expected to be $2.304 billion, including $198 million in stock-based compensation and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. This results in earnings per share of $2.69 for the year, also an increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include : the $150 million change in deferred net revenue; $200 million of stock-based compensation attributable to operating expenses and cost of revenue; $37 million in acquisition-related costs; $2 million in debt-related expenses; and a reduction of 1 million shares from the convertible bond hedge. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.3 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of $1.2 billion. We expect Q3 fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow quarter ever. We anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. This reflects a modest increase in our expectations for the underlying business, primarily based on the early success of FIFA 17. We're delighted with the way players are reacting to Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Both are reviewing very well, and we expect them to sell strongly for a long time. However, we're only a week into Battlefield and just a handful of days into Titanfall, so it's still too early to update sales forecasts for either. Guidance for the third quarter is for net revenue of $1.125 billion, including $910 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $532 million, including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses are expected to be $652 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses. Excluding the effect of stock-based compensation, expenses are up year on year, chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises and our Player Network. This results in a diluted loss per share of $0.17 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derive measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include : the $910 million change in deferred net revenue; $50 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses; and $5 million in acquisition-related expenses. We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $2.035 billion. This is up 13% year on year, driven by the combination of Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. As you build models and make year-on-year comparisons, remember that the same timing issue that pushed FIFA digital sales into fiscal Q3 will also push some holiday sales into our fiscal Q4. In conclusion, with the new innovations in FIFA. we've increased the market size. In Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, we have two extremely high-quality games in place for the holiday season, and we're continuing to grow our portfolio of successful mobile titles. Together, we expect them to deliver a record holiday quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. EA is leading across multiple growth vectors that are shaping our industry. The audience for high-quality games on HD consoles and PC continues to expand. We believe the new console options will add depth to the hardware cycle, grow the install base, and add to the player value proposition. The power of our Frostbite engine enables us to scale with platform capabilities to deliver the experiences our players want. From the groundbreaking gameplay in Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, to Mass Effect : Andromeda in stunning 4K, to extraordinary new VR experiences from our labs teams across the spectrum of high-end and lower-end devices, we are pushing the boundaries in a multi-platform world. The evolution of mobile games is another growth vector, where the tenets of great mobile experiences and great HD games continue to converge and open new high-growth opportunities. In this increasingly competitive world, where the number of players and the number of games grows on a daily basis, players are looking to major brands as markers for quality. Their expectations for creativity, innovation, polish, and depth play directly to our strengths. Our EA SPORTS titles are strong demonstrations of social play blended with strategy and action that have proven to deeply engage mobile players over time. We will continue to infuse this same approach throughout our pipeline of new mobile experiences in development for the quarters ahead. Players today also have more ways to connect and engage with the games they love. Millions of fans are competing in our global Madden NFL 17 and FIFA 17 competitions, beginning with in-game qualifications and leaderboards that will ultimately feed championship events on a world stage. In-game competitions have kicked off for Madden Bowl, our second EA Major event for Madden. And season one of the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series is underway, which will culminate with the FIFA Interactive World Cup in August 2017. Beyond competitive gaming, we're introducing new tools for our community to create content and share more of the amazing experiences they have in games like Battlefield 1. And building on the continued success of EA Access and Origin Access, we're exploring ways to provide subscription choices for more of our players. In an ever-changing world defined by more content, more devices, and an increasingly global player base, finding great games and connecting with friends becomes increasingly challenging. We are continuing to invest in our EA Player Network to reduce friction and improve discovery, purchase, and enjoyment across all of our games and player touchpoints. The player experience as you enter Battlefield 1 is a good example of how this is beginning to roll out, with a new consistent interface that brings players into their personal Battlefield universe with the games they own, content recommendations, and faster ways to squad up with their friends. The Player Network will grow and attract more players with these personalized services, in-game and out-of-game, that add value and improve the experience with every minute of play. We're energized to introduce our players to new experiences, new connections, and new ways to play. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Christopher Merwin with Barclays. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Hi, Chris. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Hey, how's it going? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Good. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It looks like last quarter I think you talked about 9 million or 10 million units for Titanfall 2 and I think under 15 million for Battlefield 1. And just based on your disclosure that the player base for Battlefield nearly doubled from Battlefield 4, can you just talk about how, if at all, those expectations have changed in the context of your raised guidance? And then just a second question, I know it's still very early days here, but I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe how the digital download mix of Battlefield 1 is trending relative to Star Wars. I think you gave the long-term guidance of a 5-point mix shift annually in terms of the digital download mix, just curious how that's looking in the early stages so far. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We're not planning on updating our unit guidance for any products, including those, but we're very optimistic about obviously both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. We're just early in the holiday sales cycle. And while there's incredible excitement around both, we just don't want everyone to get ahead of themselves in the case of focusing on units forecast. But don't take that as a negative on either product. We're very excited about both of them and think there's a long opportunity, not just in the quarter, but for a good one to two years to come. I remind people we had quite a few players still playing Battlefield 4 three years after the game shipped right up until the time we shipped Battlefield 1, so deep engagement in that product. In terms of full-game downloads, in the script we talked about growth of 4.5% in Q2, and I remind everyone that none of the digital business for FIFA was in that number. And so you should assume that we're seeing healthy growth in full-game downloads at or above our expectations. And you should assume that the early data on both Battlefield and Titanfall also is strong, mainly because of the skew towards PC of those games versus say Battlefront was a year ago. So in general, we're very comfortable with the trend that we've put in place. And we continue to see consumers defaulting to what is the easiest way to buy products. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks, Blake. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Appreciating some of the color on FIFA on a like-for-like basis, I would just be curious if you can talk about Ultimate Team paying and playing penetration now versus a year ago. And what do you see as the main drivers to take Ultimate Team penetration higher over the next couple years? And then secondly, can you just talk about early learnings on FIFA Mobile relative to what you saw on Madden Mobile when you made the changes a couple years ago? Thanks so much. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Why don't I start on the Ultimate Team piece, and then I'll have Andrew talk about the mobile piece? The Ultimate Team data is, as I mentioned, strong growth when you just look at the first four weeks. Because of the calendar differences this year versus last, we used that first four-week stack because I think it gives a good sense that Ultimate Team is growing along with the growth of the FIFA portfolio of users. The Ultimate Team growth is greater than the underlying FIFA unit growth, so that's a good sign. It's too early for us to be able to say does that mean more people are in the funnel or more people spending more? It's just early in the season to be able to say that. But we're very confident that people continue to enjoy the game mode and have found that to be a very highly engaging way to continue to come back and play FIFA every day or every week. And so we're optimistic about where that's going, but yet unable to know exactly what the stats are driving the underlying business. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On the mobile question, we're very happy with both NBA LIVE and FIFA on Mobile. As we think about the future of that and we think about a benchmark in terms of Ultimate Team on console, what we've seen with Ultimate Team on console across FIFA, Madden, and hockey, for example, is the underlying mechanic is fairly consistent. There are some nuances based on the gameplay of each particular sport and the markets where those sports are strongest and on the consumer spending habits in those markets. We're seeing similar nuances between Madden Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile, and FIFA Mobile. We're very comfortable and confident with the underlying mechanic and very excited that both NBA and FIFA are ahead of where Madden was at this point in its life cycle. And we would expect to continue to grow and tune those experiences for the core gamer and their core markets over the coming months and years. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Blake, maybe you can help us a little bit and frame the FIFA Mobile opportunity as you see it relative to Madden. I think it's important. And then it looks like Mass Effect is still scheduled for the year. Maybe talk a little bit about the flexibility around that title and how you see the timing there. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on the FIFA Mobile opportunity, obviously soccer is a much larger sport globally than American football. That's a huge positive for FIFA. And I think you could do lots of stats as to the size of the audience base for those two sports. I don't know those numbers off the top of my head, but clearly global football is a lot larger than American football. The counter to that is that mobile games tend to monetize very well in the West and, in particular, monetize well in the U.S., and that's driven by economics in the country. That means that there are places around the world where we do not expect FIFA to monetize anywhere near at the level that it does \u2013 Madden does here in the U.S. I think for us, the long-term play is how do we build an engaging mechanic in mobile that provides access to the number one sport in the world to allow people to engage like they do in Ultimate Team on console in places all around the world where they may not have access to a console or they may not be a console player. So that means large potential in all of Europe, both Western and Eastern, large potential in Latin America where soccer is very strong, and obviously large potential in China. Our goal is to go after all of those markets with a very compelling service. The beauty of mobile as well, as Andrew just mentioned, is it can be tuned and change the engagement models over time without having to build a whole new product. You don't have, like in the console business, the need to build a product every year. You're constantly updating mobile, and that provides us the ability to tailor the offering as we find what plays well in each local market. On the Mass Effect question, really our focus \u2013 the way to think about it is our focus is on building great games. Right now, Mass Effect is tracking extremely well. The game looks beautiful, and we're really pleased with its progress. However, as you've seen, we are willing to make moves in launch date if we feel it's necessary to deliver the right player experience. And our guidance assumes that Mass Effect continues to be in this year, but it gives us some flexibility that we might choose to move it either a week or three or four or five months if we have to based on what we want to make sure in terms of delivering the right experience for the player. So no news on Mass Effect other than we continue to have it in our guidance. And the moment that changes, we'll certainly let everyone know. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Andrew, any perspective you can give us on how much of a headwind you might be seeing outside the U.S. for full-game downloads as well as for downloadable content due to payments friction? And also, one more question on FIFA Mobile, if I may, now that you've shipped the game, can you talk about the extent of the resources that you have prepared for live ops and I guess follow-up content to keep up user engagement? And is there any sort of seasonality data you can share with us in terms of the global user base, especially as it regards to the EPL, Champions League, or World Cup qualifying activity? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Wow, that was a lot. I will endeavor to get all three there. On digital download data, again, what we have talked about many times is we see that growing by about 5 percentage points a year. That accounts for some more aggressive growth in certain markets over others. We do typically see markets in Europe where this is progressing more slowly. But again, I think by the time we get back to you next quarter, we will have more data on both Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 that we'll be able to share. And that will be a good measuring stick for us as we think about where digital downloads are going, but they're absolutely moving in the growth trajectory direction in all markets. But bigger markets like North America, the UK, and markets that typically have more access to digital payment methods are growing at a faster rate, as you might imagine. FIFA Mobile, as we think about that, we have built what we believe is a very, very strong EA SPORTS mobile organization. As many of you know, I had the great fortune of leading that organization, the EA SPORTS organization for a number of years, and we take great pride in really driving great broad sport experiences on every platform that people want to access interactive sports on. We see it as a real opportunity for us to grow sports in the mobile space as we have done on almost every other platform up to this point. We also believe that the live service orientation of sports is growing rapidly, as we have seen with Ultimate Team on our console business, and have built a very strong and robust organization around our SPORTS Mobile business that we believe is very well resourced to deal with the live service opportunity that we think those games will bring on mobile. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think to add to that, one of the keys to remember is it's not just running a live service. It's driving events, and you mentioned events associated with the Premier League or with actions that are going on in the sporting world like World Cup or, in the case of American football, the Super Bowl or playoffs. Our strength is to drive those live ops, and we believe that that works in both the success we've had. That's proven in the success we've had in Ultimate Team. It's proven early on in the success we've had with Madden, and we think we can do that. And I think it will prove ultimately that it will help us in the competitive sports world in how we design the tournaments that we're doing and how we partner with people during those tournaments. We're very excited about that potential to drive our skills around live ops across all of the platforms in which we're doing business today. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And just to add a little context on that, to your last point, which was seasonality in the global user base, particularly around European football, one of the great things about our FIFA property is the many licenses and relationships we have across domestic leagues and international teams and tournaments. And the beauty of soccer on a global basis is the season when combining domestic leagues with international tournaments is very, very long. And part of the reason why we're seeing such deep engagement in FIFA Ultimate Team month in, month out from launch through to the launch of the next version of the title is driven by this ongoing global soccer season. We would expect that to also deliver benefit to us in the mobile space. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys, a couple questions. One, any sense Titanfall is being cannibalized by other games like Battlefield 1, and anything notable to call out in terms of player overlaps or player dynamics maybe between the two titles? And we know it's still early, but any thoughts on launch windows being so close? Do you like it this close, you don't mind it, or would you rather spread them out a little bit in the future? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great question. Again, as we talked about coming into this, the first-person shooter category is a very large category, one of the largest. I think this year it's forecast to be the largest in the absence of some action adventure titles. It actually breaks down into a number of key categories. We believe that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2, while they have some overlap, fulfill very different motivations in what a player is looking for. And so we think there are really three types of players : people that really love Battlefield and that type of big strategic game play that will orient in that direction; the player that loves the fast, fluid, kinetic gameplay of Titanfall 2 and really orients in that direction; and the player that just has to play the two greatest shooters this year and will buy both. And again, we're very, very excited about the quality in both titles. We believe they both will have a long sales cycle both this quarter, through the festive season, and deep into the years come. And so as we think about the long game on this, we couldn't be in a better position for what we think is delivering great games to a very, very big player base. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, Andrew. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you and congratulations on another strong quarter and the launch of Battlefield. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Colin. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): First off, I was hoping for an update on Peter's e-sports initiatives, in particular with Battlefield. And then secondly, I was wondering if you saw any noticeable impact on sell-through of software from launch of new hardware SKUs. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So do you... Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Let me jump on \u2013 Peter and the competitive gaming group inside Electronic Arts have been doing amazing work. Again, we've been doing competitive gaming for a number of years, but the energy that Peter and his team have brought to it has really taken it to the next level. What you heard in the prepared remarks is how strong we are going into both FIFA and Madden seasons, focused on all aspects of the player journey, from the grass roots level in qualifying tournaments through to elite leagues and elite championships on a global stage. And we're very, very excited about what that is doing for engagement and how that is bringing new people into play, both in our Madden and FIFA franchises. With the launch of Battlefield 1, as you can imagine, we are also looking deep into Battlefield 1 tournaments. We have run a lot of great tournaments with partners in Europe and in North America with Battlefield in the past. And with the launch now in place and the quality of the game so high, the team is working on some very specific game modes and features that will further enhance the competitive play in Battlefield 1 over the coming months and years. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On the console question, it's a little early for us to know what the big impact will be of new PlayStation and Xbox models. We're extremely excited about them. The gameplay quality is obviously fantastic. We think the consumer experience is going be great on both of those consoles. But it's early because the selling season is really as we go between now and the end of the calendar year. Our internal estimate is still roughly 80 million units by the end of calendar year and 100 million units by the end of next year, calendar year. And as a note, the install base right now is 33% higher than the previous generation consoles for the first 35 months in the West. All of that bodes extremely well for the overall business. And that combined with the fact that I think you'll continue to see fantastic deals around bundling associated with the new consoles, the consumer is really going to get a great opportunity to increase or enter the best level of the gaming business that we've seen in a long time. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much for taking the questions, maybe two more on the cost side of the equation. One, as you see the competitive environment playing out through the holiday period, how's that competitive intensity comparing with what you were thinking in terms of spending on marketing or combating the competitive intensity during the holiday period? That's number one. Number two, Blake, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about R&D. Obviously, you have some titles you haven't unveiled yet as we look out towards fiscal 2018. Any way you can size for us what the R&D scope against numbers might be as we look out, either this quarter or in future periods, versus things that haven't yet been announced on the revenue side but could be impacting us on margins and free cash flow? Thanks guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on the competitive nature, we've built into our guidance appropriate marketing spending. We do tend to see, as you saw this quarter, there tends to be phasing from Q2 into Q3 in certain programs. We decide on timing at the last minute. But in general, I think the core marketing focus, including traditional holiday promotions and all the activities around everything from Black Friday through the end of the calendar year, I think are pretty well baked in and are reflected in our guidance. So I don't think you should see something different than that relative to our overall marketing spend. In terms of R&D, we've talked I think publicly about roughly 25% of our R&D is for new products. Those new products could be brand new IP such as we're building obviously a new studio in Montreal around Jade Raymond and the team she's building there, so we're hiring people for that studio. They'll be building a new action title for us. That's not next year or the following year. That will be three or four years out, but obviously we're spending money on that. We're spending money on building out around key sports properties that we have, adding things like The Journey into FIFA, for example. You'll see more of that type of work on existing products over time. And we're obviously building out on the Star Wars franchise that has proven to be very successful for us. You'll see new Star Wars product coming out in the future as well. So much of our core increases in R&D expenses have been all around those new opportunities as well as some new technology, so obviously investing in VR, investing in streaming technologies, investing in mobile. We're trying to make sure we are very focused on where the future is going and be able to be there when any new platforms develop or any shifts in platforms happen. And we think it's the prudent way to run the business. We try to make our biggest franchises as cost efficient as possible. But at the same time, we're constantly investing in innovation around those to add new and exciting ways to play the games. Operator : Your next question... Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : ...comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. So for fiscal 2017, obviously a big year for incremental titles. I was wondering if you could talk about what would be reasonable to expect as we looked into fiscal 2018. I guess does it makes sense to assume a Star Wars Battlefront title next year that could offset Battlefield 1 this year? And I think you just mentioned that the new action title in the works probably won't hit next year to offset Titanfall 2. So how should we think about comping Titanfall 2? Maybe it's strong digital growth or something that helps to offset. But basically how does this good year in fiscal 2017 impact growth rates in fiscal 2018? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So we have talked obviously about the next Battlefront coming a year from now, and we're working very hard on making sure that is an extremely deep and engaging offering. We've talked about an action title that's not yet announced, but we're very excited and that's a good chance that that will fall into fiscal 2018. I'm not yet giving guidance for 2018, so I want to be careful that we don't get overboard. But we're confident that we should be able to comp a strong year this year. One thing that people tend not to remember is when you have a title like a Battlefield or a Titanfall, those tend to sell extremely well in the catalog for at least another 12 to 24 months. And in the case of Battlefield in particular you'll have all the premium services kicking in next year. We won't see any of that in this year's revenue. So it's exciting times for our big franchises like that and huge opportunities for us to continue to monetize. We also believe our mobile business will continue to grow, which will obviously help in the comps year over year. And our live services businesses continue to get stronger and things like our FIFA online business in Asia. Our goal is to try to grow all of those to help offset what could be a great year this year. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, guys, a few things. First, congratulations on the strong ratings for Titanfall and Battlefield. Following up on your point about money into next year from those titles, how does it impact your long-term thinking about the marketing investment that you'd put against those games over the longer term? And then secondly, Blake, you mentioned that you earned the right to look at potential acquisitions, but we haven't seen a lot. What type of deals are you focused on now, and is it mostly price that's holding those up? And finally, just a quick clarity point, did I hear you correctly say that digital downloads are growing about five points a year, perhaps more in North America and the UK? If yes, what was the base we're growing off of last year? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So I'll take the marketing piece, and then I'll hand over to Blake. Yes, we certainly are adjusting and evolving how we market our titles, and we think about this on a few different vectors. First is we see core purchase of the title continuing for much, much longer, particularly of high-quality experiences with great social play dynamics, like properties like Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. And you should expect that we have planned for a longer marketing cycle around that. The second is we are using our network and investing more deeply in our network to drive cross-play of franchises within our network. And you should expect to see us continue do that using the games that we already have in the marketplace to help introduce new players to new games that we know they'll love based on their play patterns. And then the third is the live services that are wrapped around games, active marketing in and of themselves, is every time we drive a new event around a particular property as part of a live service, that acts as a beat that drives conversation in social channels about the games that we play. So as we think about an elongated initial marketing cycle, as we think about the power of our network and the amount of players that we have in it playing every day and we think about the live services that we have wrapped, we are really transforming how we market our games and believe we're getting much, much stronger ROI on every dollar spent. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And Ben, on your other two questions, on full-game downloads, we finished our fiscal 2016 around 24% of all of our games. And as we've talked about publicly, we lag the industry by one or two points primarily because FIFA is such a large global product. It has huge share in some marketplaces where full-game downloads, due to bandwidth or credit card capabilities, are not \u2013 it impacts that business there. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Blake, are those console games, or PC also? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: They're PC... Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Was it 24% of all? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Excuse me. This is Gen 4-only consoles, sorry. Obviously, PC skews it. 75% to 80% of all PC games are full-game downloads. That pulls the numbers up. We think the industry is going be probably by calendar year end around 30%. And our internal estimates are around 29% for ourselves, once again, slight lag with the industry. But as I said, I think we're seeing positive trends on all of that, so that's good. And then on the last piece, M&A, we look at everything as one of the large players in the industry. We have the benefit of everything gets shopped to us. And we have good relationships with virtually everyone in the business, so we tend to have ongoing dialogue with everyone. Price has been an issue on some of the big deals that have been recently completed. For us, the bigger issue is the correct fit and the right product mix. And unfortunately, just there are not lots of AAA studios out there in today's world, and it's very different than it was 10 years ago in the business. We continue to look at things. We're always trying to find ways to create value for shareholders. But in the same vein, we're very careful that we don't simply try to fuel growth through acquisitions. We need to fuel value creation, not just the top line. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi, this is San in for Neil. Offering free DLC for Titanfall is pretty unique. I was wondering if you can share the feedback you're getting on that decision, and if you're expecting that to have a different sales curve on the game versus others with a season pass. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Can you repeat the first part of the question again? Sorry, we didn't hear. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Sure. So offering a free DLC for Titanfall is pretty unique. I was just wondering if you can share the feedback you're getting thus far on that decision, and if you're expecting that to impact the game with a different sales curve versus other titles that traditionally would have a season pass. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Okay, I'll let Andrew take it. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great question, the feedback has been really, really positive. If you go and look at the player conversation in the marketplace right now around Titanfall 2, it's very, very strong. Respawn, who are an amazing studio who have built some of the greatest games over the last decade, have a real commitment to players, as do we as a company, and are looking to support and drive and grow and nurture that community over a number of years. And the whole construct of how they have put that plan together is receiving really positive feedback from that community. As we think more broadly about how that impacts other games, again, we have a big and diverse portfolio with a growing and diverse player base, and we are always looking for the best way to offer amazing gameplay experiences with tremendous value to our player base. And we'll always take feedback from our player base as to how we should think about things on a go-forward basis. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think one thing to remember, it gets lost I think on a big AAA title like Titanfall. We are working with Respawn to build a franchise. This is something that we plan to be working with them on for many, many years to come, and there's huge opportunity inside of that franchise to continue to expand it. And so part of the strategy of building a franchise is you have a long view. You think about the business differently than you might an existing franchise like a FIFA or a Madden. And what that means is we're looking for ways to not fragment the player base early, but to include as everybody as possible and as we can to continue to build that franchise. We think that's the right strategy for a product like Titanfall. And more to come as we learn more, but that's the reason that we chose to go the route we went. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. And just a second question related to that, we were actually surprised to see some retailers out of stock with physical copies of the game both at retail and online. Anything notable to call out with the sales channel there? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: That people bought the game I guess, and retailers didn't have enough stock in place. I don't know. I hope that someone, if they couldn't find it on the retail shelves, went home and digitally downloaded it. But I think with the new franchise, there's only been \u2013 remember, there was only one Titanfall before and it was single-platform. And so retailers oftentimes, they have their own sales models. They try to build their own demand models, and they listen to the consumer and they listen to our salespeople. But at the same time, they're trying to balance how much they put on shelves. And they've got to spend money to build inventory, and so you might have found retailers out of stock, and we hope that we've gone back and got those shelves filled up for the future. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks a lot. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question. On Madden and Madden for Mobile, I'm just curious. How much overlap is there between mobile players and the console players, and are you seeing any shifts in time spent? And when you think about money that's being spent, is there any cannibalization from Madden for Mobile, or is it additive? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So at a macro level, when you look at it, it's clearly additive because both businesses are growing. What we have seen is that mobile is adding younger players at a higher rate than console is, but we're also seeing some mobile players come across. And I believe the number \u2013 I believe about 70% or 75% of console players also play Madden Mobile. And so what we're seeing is, when you're a football fan and you're a Madden fan, you love the experience that is high-definition on your 80-inch television coupled with a live service like Madden Ultimate Team that connects you with your friends in that high-def experience. But you also love Madden and Madden games while you're on the go, and you're using mobile as an opportunity to do that. As we look to the future, we think there is a world where we drive even greater connection at a design level between the console experience and the mobile experience, and we believe that is going be a strategic opportunity for us as we think about the growing player base in any one of our franchises. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Great. And just... Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: One last question? I'm sorry. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: One more question, operator. Operator : I'm sorry. Our final question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys, great quarter. Thanks for squeezing me in, Blake, I appreciate it, just two for me. I'm curious on how Respawn moves forward here. Normally, we would think of maybe a Titanfall 3 in a couple years, but I think they're also excited to work on a Star Wars game, so I'm wondering if you're growing the studio there or how we should think about pacing of those two games in the future. Then a last one, just thinking about the comp issue for 2018, remastered games have obviously been very popular. I think you've done less there than maybe some of your peers. How are you thinking about remastered games as an opportunity in the future? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On the Respawn element, again, we have announced we have a long-term relationship planned with them. We are looking at a number of different things with them. As is related to Titanfall 2, there is still a lot of things that they'll be putting into the game for the foreseeable future. One of the lessons that we have learned is that when you have a great game like Titanfall 2 or Battlefield 1, giving it enough breathing room in the marketplace for fans to play for many years is really important to delivering the true value of that experience to fans, as we did with Battlefield 4. Again, I think just a quarter ago we announced that we still had 11 million people playing Battlefield 4. And so the expectation is that Respawn will continue to support and grow the Titanfall community through Titanfall 2. And over time we'll work out what the right cadence for next version of Titanfall is and/or any other titles they're working on. And then the second part? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: A remaster. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And the second part in terms of remasters, again, it's something that we look at. In all cases, we're trying figure out what is right for the player. If there's a world where there are games that we have in our catalog that players really want to play in a remastered variety and we believe that we can add the kind of enhancements that make that worthwhile for a player, then we will do that. Nothing to announce today, but certainly you can imagine with a portfolio as rich and deep as ours and with a player base as engaged as ours that we're getting lots of requests right now. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: With that, I thank everyone. We look forward to seeing or talking to everybody over the next quarter, and we'll see everyone back for earnings at the end of January. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Electronic Arts was the leading console games publisher and most downloaded mobile games publisher in the world for Q3 FY 2017, driven by high-performing titles and tremendous engagement from our players. Our net sales and digital sales reached record levels for the quarter, and we exceeded our Q3 guidance for revenue and earnings. The excellent holiday quarter for EA was a demonstration of the strength of our portfolio, with new titles, new content and new competitive gaming tournaments delivering great entertainment to players worldwide. To touch on a few highlights, FIFA 17 was the top-selling console title in the world for 2016. We grew our FIFA player base significantly year-over-year through the addition of a new story mode, The Journey, Frostbite-powered gameplay and new experiences in FIFA Ultimate Team. More than 10 million fans have played The Journey, and FUT players are up nearly 10% year-over-year. It was also an excellent year for FIFA competitive gaming. Our eSports competitions for players at all levels have led to dramatic increases in engagement among competitive players. Through Q3, FIFA 17 competitors were playing nearly three times more than the rest of the FIFA community, and we expect the excitement will continue as we add more competitions, more broadcasts and more content in the year ahead. Battlefield 1 was our biggest Battlefield launch ever, delivering innovation, creativity and all-out warfare that players were looking for. The team at DICE created a truly groundbreaking experience that is driving massive engagement and growing our global Battlefield community. The unique player base of Battlefield 1 is more than 50% larger than that of Battlefield 4 in its comparable launch quarter, with more than a third of the players being new to the franchise or new to EA. We also have a lot of excitement ahead for our Battlefield 1 community. Battlefield 1 premium players will have early access to our first expansion pack coming in March, and we'll continue to bring more maps, more armies and more amazing content to the game in the months to come. Titanfall 2 delivered the next important step in this new franchise we are building with our partners at Respawn, a highly-rated, action-packed experience that has thrilled players in the year's biggest category. Player satisfaction scores for Titanfall 2 are among the highest in our portfolio, showing just how much fun players are having with the game. Titanfall 2 will be played for a long time to come, with new maps, modes and content updates continuing to expand the experience and engage our players. We're excited about our long-term plans for the Titanfall franchise. We are building our mobile games today to have a long life with players through outstanding live services and dynamic content updates. For example, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes added ship battles and Rogue One content in Q3, driving average gameplay time per player to an unprecedented total of 155 minutes per day. Our EA Sports titles in mobile are also great demonstrations of this strategy. Madden NFL Mobile continues to perform near the top of the iOS App Store chart in its third season. NBA Live Mobile and FIFA Mobile are also growing thriving communities with strong engagement. The combination of authenticity, great gameplay, and live services in these games is igniting the passion of sports fans worldwide. And we'll continue growing these communities with more sports-specific and geo-specific experiences. These examples show our unwavering focus on connecting players to more amazing experiences across more devices and in more geographies. With fans playing the games they love for longer, we are building and supporting deep communities that thrive for many years after launch. Players in Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and our EA mobile titles are just beginning to engage in these long-term experiences. Moving to Q4, we're excited to deliver the highly-anticipated Mass Effect : Andromeda beginning on March 21. This all new story of exploration in the Mass Effect universe will be brought to life in stunning detail using our Frostbite engine, with new characters, new environments, and a whole new set of possibilities to excite players around the world. Looking further ahead, we would like to provide you with a view of our top titles and plans for FY 2018. We're thrilled to bring a new Star Wars Battlefront game to fans worldwide in 2017 holiday season. In the past two years, Rogue One and The Force Awakens have opened new storylines and captured the imagination of hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans. We've listened closely to our passionate Star Wars Battlefront community and have expanded our existing game with more great content and experiences since its launch. As that game continues to thrive, we have also heard our players' desire for even more depth and progression. Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new single-player campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. To build a game of this magnitude, we've brought together three great studios, DICE, Motive and Criterion, and allowing their areas of expertise to deliver an amazing experience in the next Star Wars Battlefront. We will continue to drive innovation and competition in our EA Sports franchises. FIFA 18 will build on the foundation we created with story mode this year, bringing players back to The Journey with Season 2, featuring new characters and new storylines. Our development team in Vancouver is delivering deeply innovative new experiences across this year's game, including an Ultimate Team, and creating the most emotionally immersive and connected FIFA we have ever produced. Our Madden NFL franchise will transition to the Frostbite engine with Madden NFL 18, unlocking major visual advancements and new gameplay experiences that will excite dedicated Madden players, football fans and sports fans overall. Our complete roster of EA Sports titles in FY 2018 will include NHL 18, a new chapter of our UFC franchise, and an all new NBA LIVE game launching in the fall. Our focus for EA's Competitive Gaming Division is to grow engagement in some of our biggest global franchises. With strong results to date, we will now expand EA Competitive Gaming even further in FY 2018, fueled by more competitions, new sponsors and broadcast partners and original programming. Players will be able to compete in dozens of competitions from online leagues to massive regional championships, like our FIFA Online 3 championship in Korea, to our biggest event yet on a global stage, including the Fight Championship Finals and the Madden Championship. We're also very excited to kick off competitive gaming events for Battlefield later in the year. We're also excited to have a new Need for Speed title launch in FY 2018. We've given the game an extended development cycle to focus on innovation, and the Need for Speed team is pushing the boundaries of action driving with what we believe is the most exciting and best looking Need for Speed game we've ever produced. We will continue to build our mobile portfolio, expanding on our success to deliver more engaging and fun mobile games in mass-market franchises with global audience appeal. Thriving player bases in our existing live services for Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, EA Sports and more will receive major new content update throughout the year, and more in-game events will keep the games fresh, engaging and fun. We're deeply committed to players in our Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 communities. Throughout the year ahead, we will continue to launch new content and new experiences to expand these vast and dynamic games. At the end of the fiscal year, our BioWare studio will be delivering an all new IP. A clean-sheet design with new concepts, new game play mechanics and new stories, set in a unique new universe. This game has the potential to fundamentally disrupt the way people think about an action title, bringing friends together to play in an exhilarating new way. We're very excited about the future of this new franchise and its ability to attract a large global audience. Our industry is poised for continued growth. The console market continues to strengthen. Mobile continues its expansion, and more companies are entering the space and investing in new platforms. These moves bring more choices to players, and EA is in a unique position of strength. With our Frostbite engine powering more of our portfolio, EA's games are some of the most highly rated in the industry. Engagement in our titles continues to deepen, and our global reach is expanding through competition and new ways to play. We're also making games more personal, leveraging deep learning to build intelligence into our EA player network that will help players find their friends and connect with more of the games they want to play. We look forward to continuing our momentum through Q4 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with historical non-GAAP results. These can be used in conjunction with the financial model we have posted on our Investor Relations website to calculate measures comparable with our historical results. We are delighted with our third quarter, which was driven by the blockbuster launch of Battlefield 1 and continued strong performance from FIFA 17 and FIFA 17 Ultimate Team. In mobile, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectations. This resulted in record-setting performance for the Company, including our first-ever billion-dollar cash flow quarter. I will highlight other records as we go through the details. EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, compared to $1.07 billion last year. Net revenue was above our guidance by $24 million. Year-on-year growth was driven by Battlefield 1. If you had \u2013 if you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add the change in deferred net revenue of $921 million to the $1.15 billion of GAAP revenue. Our cost of revenue was $516 million, including historic acquisition-related expenses of $18 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, up 6.1 percentage points over last year. The gross margin for our underlying business continues to grow, driven by product mix and the shift to digital. Operating expenses were $637 million, up $82 million or 15% year-on-year, driven by increased marketing activities around the launches this Q3. The $637 million includes $48 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses. Moving on to EPS. Because the GAAP revenue recognition standards require us to defer most of the revenue out of the quarter, but recognize the expense of launching games in the quarter, Q3 is only a breakeven quarter on a GAAP basis. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $921 million change in deferred net revenue, $20 million in acquisition-related expenses, $48 million of stock-based compensation, and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that had we reported a GAAP profit, our share count would have been $313 million. Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $1.11 billion, a new record for the company, and $226 million higher than the record set in the same quarter last year. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was also a record at $1.37 billion. With capital expenditures of $124 million over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $1.25 billion in the same period. Please see our earning slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $156 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter was $4.22 billion, with 42% of this balance held on shore. This is down slightly from 43% last quarter, the change driven primarily by the share repurchase and the greater cash generation offshore. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $2.07 billion, a new record for the company. The outperformance versus our expectation was driven by Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, offset by Titanfall 2. Battlefield 1 is on course to be our best Battlefield ever. Sell-through of FIFA 17 during Q2 and Q3 was 8% higher than FIFA 16 in the same period last year. And FIFA Ultimate Team sales continue to grow strongly. Like Battlefield 1, FIFA 17 is on course to be our best-selling FIFA of all time. Digital net sales were a record $1.1 billion, up $288 million on the year ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in digital downloads and about $50 million of digital net sales from FIFA launch captured this quarter rather than in Q2 as it was the case in fiscal 2016. Digital sales now represent about 60% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. Looking at each of the components of this digital \u2013 quarter digital sales in turn. First, extra content and premium net sales were up 28% year-on-year to $462 million. As mentioned last quarter, this includes launch sales of FIFA Ultimate Team that were not captured in the same quarter a year ago. Using Q2 plus Q3 as the measurement period, FIFA 17 Ultimate Team grew 22% over FIFA 16 Ultimate Team despite ongoing currency headwinds. At constant currency, year-on-year growth would have been 30%. This extraordinary growth in a major business is driven by innovations such as the story mode we had at the FIFA and by enthusiasm for the competitive gaming mode FUT Champions. In China, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play game, continues to benefit from the growing interest in investment and soccer there. In mobile, we had a record quarter. Net sales were $174 million, up 7% year-on-year with growth again led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. Madden NFL Mobile, SimCity BuildIt and the Sims FreePlay also made strong contributions to the quarter. NBA Live Mobile and FIFA Mobile are delivering strong installs and engagement, which we believe can translate into greater monetization over time. Net sales of full game PC and console downloads were $355 million, another record, and 82% higher than last year. As anticipated, digital downloads for Battlefield 1 were much stronger than for Star Wars Battlefront in the year ago quarter. 32% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on current generation consoles over the last 12 months. This is ahead of our fiscal year target of 29% and is likely to be driven slightly higher again by the fourth quarter, which is dominated by catalog sales. Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $104 million to net sales, up 16% year-on-year. EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow. Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year guidance to $4.8 billion in net revenue and $125 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.338 billion, including $43 million of historical acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation. Operating expenses are expected to be $2.306 billion, including $192 million in stock-based comp and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. Our investment in future revenue continues through development of a new IP, including building out our Motive Studios in Montr\u00e9al, building our player network infrastructure, and expanding our eSports footprint. This results in earnings per share of $2.91 for the year, a $0.22 increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derived measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $125 million change in deferred net revenue, $194 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and cost of revenue, $49 million in acquisition-related costs, $2 million in debt-related expenses, and the reduction of 1 million shares for the convertible bond hedge. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we're raising our operating cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.35 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.25 billion. We expect fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow year ever. We continue to anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. However, the underlying profitability is up significantly due particularly to the success of Battlefield 1 and FIFA Ultimate Team. Guidance for the fourth quarter is for net revenue of $1.48 billion, including the recognition of $407 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $242 million. Operating expenses are expected to be $591 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related costs. Expenses are up year-on-year chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises and our player network. This results in an earnings per share of $1.64 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derived measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $470 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million in stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses. We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $1.07 billion. This is up 16% year-on-year by Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect : Andromeda. FX continues to be a drag on year-on-year comparisons. Although our hedging program mitigates the effects of short-term movements in exchange rate, no hedging program can wholly protect a company for long-term structural changes in exchange rates. So, that builds a headwind for fiscal 2017 versus 2016 in comparison, and it looks like we'll face an even greater headwind in fiscal 2018. In conclusion, we had our best ever holiday quarter driven by record performances from our two largest franchises, Battlefield and FIFA. This was supported by a record quarter in mobile, led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. All three of these titles have strong live service components, and these position us well going into fiscal 2018. Andrew introduced our fiscal 2018 slate today, and we'll be providing you with detailed financial guidance in May. Our results demonstrate the cash and earnings power of our business model, and we look forward to an exciting 2018 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. FY 2017 has been an extraordinary year to date. EA delivered some of the top games in the industry with growing engagement and continue to exceed our guidance. Now, we have more exciting plans ahead. Creating amazing games and pioneering new ways to play will always be at our call. As games continue to touch the lives of more and more people around the world through more devices and more platforms, the deep engagement that games uniquely deliver becomes increasingly valuable. Maintaining that engagement in a crowded world where players are continually challenged for time requires solving fundamental challenges to remove friction in a digital networked world. Our EA player network is designed for those challenges, to help players stay connected to their friends and their favorite games whenever and wherever they are ready to play. It redefines the player value proposition from one that depends on each player building a network inside every new game to one that moves seamlessly from experience to experience across devices with their friends and with their achievements. The EA player network is coming to life today. Our Battlefield games now have a central user interface that dynamically solves for the needs of our players. It will recommend experiences relevant to them based on the modes they're playing, new community challenges, new events or content to help them improve their skills. More powerfully, the interface helps players find their friends faster and jump into games together, an essential service for multi-player games. This is the true power of the player network, keeping players connected with their friends and the games they love, and applying deep learning to bring personalization that will make every experience meaningful, enables us to help our players move fluently across different games, genres and platforms, all inside our network. With great games like Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, and our EA Sports experiences on console and mobile, we are connecting with more players around the world. Through our live services like Ultimate Team and global competitive gaming tournaments and events, we are giving them deep and dynamic ways to engage. Through subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access, we are giving players more choice and great value. The player network becomes the consistent thread through all of these experiences and more, helping our players navigate a crowded world, and helping us to deliver a truly connected future of play. We're looking forward to finishing FY 2017 with a strong fourth quarter and delivering more great entertainment to our global network of players. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. So, the first one on FIFA Ultimate Team being up 30% ex FX, it's really strong, understanding it's from campaign mode and Frostbite. Could you help us understand a little bit more the breakdown of paying user growth versus spend per user? And then, at this point, what do you see as being the main point of friction that holds back paying Ultimate Team adoption? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. I think the metrics have not changed dramatically between paying users and nonpaying users. What we've done is we've brought many more players into Ultimate Team, which is really the goal of what we're trying to do. We want people to have a great experience, more people that play the experience gets better. And we also want to give people new ways to play the game, which we've shown drives more excitement and more interest into the game, as well as the connection into our competitive gaming activities. Over time, we've seen the spend levels climb, but our focus is really on bringing more and more people into the atmosphere of the game to play it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. So, Andrew, I think you called out a new Need for Speed for fiscal 2018. There also seems to be a Need for Speed Edge, which seems to be an online version that's being published by Nexon, so we're wondering if you can add further perspective there? And will this game follow the path of FIFA online so that it can get exported to other markets like China? And, Blake, the 32% of sales for Battlefield coming from download. I think we're used to thinking about a pick-up of about 5% in terms of the mix shift from physical to downloads. I'm wondering if there's anything you can highlight in terms of the consumer behavior there. Is the shift accelerating or is this something specific to Battlefield? Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So, on the Need for Speed question, one of the things that is wonderful about having such a deep portfolio of global brand is to have tremendous appeal around the world, and Need for Speed, like FIFA, is one of those brands that has tremendous appeal in North America, Europe, South America and throughout Asia. However, as we think about different markets, it's really important for us to establish games according to a modality of play that makes sense for that market. So, again, with Need for Speed Edge, it is effectively the same track that we took with FIFA Online 3, which is the core component of gameplay which is fast cars, amazing chases, and over-the-top driving action. It will form the center place of Need for Speed Edge, but it will be done in a free-to-play environment the same way FIFA is. It's early days for Need for Speed Edge, but you might imagine that as we continue to grow that property in Asia that it would follow a similar path to that which we've taken with FIFA Online 3. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And, Stephen, your question on full game downloads. Just to clarify, the 32% number is a trailing 12-month number for all of our titles on Gen 4 consoles, and as comparison, in fiscal 2015, that number was 20%; fiscal 2016, it was 24%; and this year, it's running at 32%. We thought it would be probably 29% for the full year \u2013 our full fiscal year, so running ahead of that. The Battlefield numbers, we don't disclose those, but since it is a very popular PC title, which north of 75% of those games are sold digitally, you should assume that the Battlefield full game download numbers skewed higher than what we've seen, in contrast to last year when we saw Battlefront which skewed lower because it was less of a PC-based title, so. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Great. Thank you. Just had a couple. So, just a follow-up on the download question. Gross margins were obviously very strong in the 3Q, and Blake, as you mentioned, that was, I guess, due mostly to Battlefield and perhaps lower royalties from Titanfall. But it looks like you've guided to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2017, which is well ahead of the 100 basis point annual target. So, just as we start to think about fiscal 2018, could you say how much of the benefit that we're seeing this year is one-time in nature and what that might mean for next year, obviously, that given guidance there? And then a second question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the strength of engagement you've seen with Battlefield 1, so I was wondering if you could talk about how that's manifested itself in DLC and MTX? And maybe more specifically, what the attach rate of all extra content sales looks like for Battlefield 1 relative to Battlefield 4? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So, clearly we saw a very large gross margin improvement in the quarter. That's a combination of higher digital, as we just discussed, both in terms of full game download and higher extra content in the form of Ultimate Team. It also is \u2013 as you called out, we sold less Titanfall 2 than we expected and we sold more Battlefield 1 than we expected. And Battlefield 1 is a higher-margin product for us, and so that acted as a way of improving the margin. We will see some pressure next year because we'll flip back to a large royalty-bearing title in the form of Battlefront, and as we saw last year that put somewhat of a damper on the OpEx, excuse me, on the gross margin. I don't yet have the numbers to give you for guidance. We'll do that in May, and we'll try to call out the impact. But you should assume that we'll have the benefits from continued mix change, more digital, more digital live services as well as more digital full game downloads, and some of that could be offset by royalty-bearing titles, but probably not fully offset by it. We should continue to see some gross margin improvement. In terms of the Battlefield 1 extra content, we're just getting going on our extra content plan. Our first DLC ships in March, the end of March. There's virtually no revenue this year for that. That will all come next year. So, I'll give you a better sense of the attach and the revenue associated with that when we do guidance. But we're very excited about the potential because we have such an engaged and large consumer base playing the game. We will look to DLC, MTX and many different methods for people to continue to enjoy the game and deepen their experience, and we'll tell you more about that in the months to come. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple quick ones. The new BioWare game, I think you mentioned it was action and adventure in the description. Is that an RPG game we should assume, coming from BioWare's history? And then, we may have missed this, but is that owned IP or will that be royalty-bearing licensed IP? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, it's action-adventure, not RPG. So, what we're starting to see more and more in game genres is kind of genre melding, which is great components of a number of different genres really kind of coming together into single games. And so, when you think about this game, you should be thinking about the great RPG character development and storyline progression that BioWare is known for, but in a world of greater action and greater adventure, which is growing to be one of the larger categories in games. It will be a wholly-owned IP. We're very excited about it, and we'll share more in the year to come. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Blake, you did a really good job kind of guiding the units for Battlefield and Titanfall. I wonder, just to help us think about how big those were and digital potential, if you can give us any sense of how many units have sold through or just the number of players in Battlefield. Andrew, you have Battlefront coming next year. You've mentioned a lot of new features in a single-player campaign. Can we think about that growing versus the first one? I'm just wondering what your thoughts there. And then last one, Blake, on Ultimate Team, I think the last update was $500 million or so. I was just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on the size of revenue this fiscal year? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me hit the first two, and then I'll let Andrew jump in \u2013 or the first and last one. The units, we're going to actually spend less time talking about units going forward in the future, for one simple thing which is the business is becoming far less important around units sold. We're very excited. We sold more units than we expected to sell in Battlefield. And we sold less units than we expected in Titanfall. The Battlefield units are on track to be one of the biggest titles in the shooter market in the world, and we're very excited about that. And that means there's a lot of people playing, and the engagement levels they're playing at are at a point we've not even seen in our past, with highly-engaged audience and incredible depth of gameplay that's going on. And so, you should assume that we'll give units probably upfront when we give guidance to give people sizing, but we're going to try to spend less time talking about the units and more time talking about the revenue associated with the game because we think that's more important. In terms of, let's see, your last question was? Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Ultimate Team. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Ultimate Team. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Ultimate Team, yeah. So, we're now tracking close to $800 million a year on Ultimate Team between the three sports. Obviously, FIFA is the largest, followed by Madden, and then followed by Hockey. But it's very encouraging at the continued excitement around that business and our ability to continue to grow, despite its extremely large size already. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, as far as Battlefront, again, we're not in a place where we're going to give unit guidance or revenue guidance at this juncture. But here is what I would leave you with. This is going to be a big game. The first game was very well received. It was widely regarded as a game that fulfilled people's Star Wars fantasies in ways they could never imagine. But it was also a game where people asked for a lot more, and a lot more depth and a lot more of the greatness of the game kind of embodied. This game, again, is going to be in more locations, more game modes, more eras, more shifts, including a full single-play campaign which is very, very exciting. So, we have every reason to believe we're delivering fans exactly what they're asking for with respect to a Star Wars game. They've also had another movie since we launched the last one, and another one coming later this year, and we would expect that the global fan base for Star Wars will continue to grow. So, we feel great about the game, we feel great about the overall community, and we feel great about the energy that the movie will generate in and around the launch of the game. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple. First off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the relationship with the respond in terms of the future of Titanfall. It sounds like, from your comments, Andrew, that there will be a future sequel. And then, secondly, I was hoping you could address the level of support for the Nintendo Switch, if there's been a change since the last call in terms of our R&D commitments and titles in development. Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, we have a great relationship with Respawn. I was actually down there with them recently, spending time. We're very excited about Titanfall 2. We think that game's going to sell for a really long time. As we said in our prepared remarks, it's one of the highest-rated shooters of the generation. It's also got some of the highest NPS scores across our portfolio. So, people playing the game, they're having a great time. We remain committed to that relationship. We remain committed to Titanfall. And we look forward to doing a lot more Titanfall 2 over the year to come. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And Nintendo Switch? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And in Nintendo Switch, no change. As we've announced, we're going to launch FIFA for Nintendo Switch later this year. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Blake, just to slip another one in, just to clarify. It looks like NBA LIVE was in the release slate for March in the last presentation. It does not appear in this presentation. Could you just clarify if that was a change? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: That's a good catch, Colin. I'll let Andrew give you the sort of the development view of NBA LIVE. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. As everyone knows, we have been on a journey with NBA LIVE. It's something that we remain again very committed to, with our partnership with the NBA, and want to deliver something that's truly innovative and disruptive in the marketplace. We had planned a launch in the not too distant future with what we believe was going to be the first step towards that level of innovation, creativity to create a disruption in the marketplace. In all honesty, we got the game and it's really, really good and a lot of fun, and we feel like we are better positioned to launch that with the fullness of the NBA season ahead of us, and have decided to double down on that, add to it and launch it as a full beat later in the year. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So you'll hear more about that and see more coming over the next six months. As Andrew said, we're extremely excited about it, and I've been able to beat Andrew a couple of times, as long as I'm playing as Steph Curry. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. All right. Thanks, guys. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. The questions, maybe one on mobile. Just wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of both player engagement and monetization on the key sports titles in the mobile format, whether you're seeing any difference between phone and tablet in the way people are sort of engaging with those titles. And then second, maybe more for Blake, but just a updated view of the way you're thinking about the balance sheet, deploying cash, looking at the M&A landscape, sort of an update on your balance sheet view. Thanks so much, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: There are two buckets of monetization you're talking about there, which was across different sports titles and then I think you layered in mobile and tablet in the end. Again, what we're seeing more broadly in mobile is that great titles with great brands are holding their position in the top of the charts, and Madden is a great example of that. We're also seeing that the expectations of gamers now is growing and the games need to be bigger and deeper and offer new and interesting ways to play. And what we're seeing now with Madden is that in its third season, it's reaching that level of depth and breadth and really engaging players in a big way. We are early days in the FIFA and NBA mobile games. And what we're looking at now is while the core infrastructure was very similar to Madden and we're very happy with their performance to- date \u2013 again, they're in line with our expectations \u2013 we are looking at sports-specific and geo-specific tuning of the feature set and the experience that we think over the coming years will continue to grow those businesses, as we have done with Madden. In terms of phone versus tablet, I don't have any exact stats with me now, but we see a lot more play still happening on mobile phones versus tablets, but we do get players playing across both and monetizing on both. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On the balance sheet, obviously, the great news is our cash flow continues to grow, which means our cash balance continues to grow. We will be talking next quarter about what our next view of a share buyback program will be because our current program will be up in May. We think we'll finish the current buyback, $1 billion buyback, right around that time. We're also, as we've talked about before, looking at everything that is out in the marketplace. Being one of the largest players in the market, we get a chance to look at virtually everything. We're very disciplined on price, as we've talked about, and we want to make sure it fits the model and culture of EA to consider anything. Don't have anything to tell you today other than we'll continue to look and we're very open to continuing to try to grow the franchise, but the good news is, as Andrew has discussed today, with the new BioWare title, we feel like we have substantial opportunities internally to continue to grow this business around great IP, great creative talent, and great ways to play games that we don't even think have fully even scratched the surface, as we've proven with Ultimate Team, but we think can be done with other franchises inside the organization. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey guys. I just want to ask about the fourth quarter. Some of the titles and content you have scheduled to release, and as it relates to that digital revenue, you mentioned that Battlefield expansion pack late in the quarter. Mass Effect is March 21, I believe, in North America and March 23 in Europe. Given those dates and the revenue recognition \u2013 I think you recognize digital revenue 10 to 14 days in arrears \u2013 is it possible that that gets pushed to fiscal 2018? And my second question relates to Titanfall. I just want to understand if you have any thoughts as to why you think it underperformed and going forward, what the digital monetization strategy will be with that franchise. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, I'll address the first one, Drew, and then Andrew can address the Titanfall question. Our digital cutoff is typically about 5 to 7 days depending on the calendar more than the actual days, so we will get some digital from the first few days of sales for Mass Effect. We will get very little revenue just because the way we book the revenue for the DLCs on Battlefield 1. So, you can assume that's close to zero, and assume Mass Effect is going to be anywhere between 30% to 50% of the lifetime of that title. And the last Mass Effect did close to 6 million units, so you'll probably see something like around 3 million units in the quarter depending on exact timing, so. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And on Titanfall, well, as Blake highlighted earlier, it sold less than we expected in the timeframe. We're not seeing it as underperformance at this juncture. What we have demonstrated as an organization is that with great games, we can sell them for many months and often many years. And if you look at the sales curve of Battlefield 4, we were still selling lots of units three years post and still had nearly 10 million people playing that game right in the lead up to Battlefield 1. So, the way we think about Titanfall is that we have what is one of the best games of this year, and certainly one of the best games in this generation of consoles, in what is this year's largest category. And we've got a development team who have unbelievable pedigree and a commitment to continue to support the community, and we expect to continue to grow that community through the coming fiscal year. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Just a quick question on mobile, Blake. I think mobile grew around 7%, kind of well below the double-digit growth we've seen over the past few quarters. Any color on what drove that slowdown and whether we should kind of see that rebound back to double-digit growth again? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I think the growth in mobile, remember, is driven oftentimes by when new titles come out, so you have to be careful not to get too hung up on that and instead think about the broad portfolio. And so, if you get a big title coming in and you got a lot of activity earlier on, you're going to bump up the level. I think the one thing to note is that's the largest mobile quarter we've had in our history, which is what we're really focused on, which is how do we have a continued growth of the franchises inside mobile, seeing titles like Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes grow, but also titles like SimCity BuildIt or Sims FreePlay or the sports titles. Our goal is, how do we continue to build the footprint that we have on console in the sports world also on mobile? We're pretty confident we can do that, but we know it takes time. So, I can't predict today what the growth rate's going to look like for full year next year, but I would say that, focus more on the annual growth and on the size of the franchises and, really important, the stability of those franchises. As we've talked about before, our focus is to have a very profitable mobile business, which means we're not going to overmonetize or overspend just to try to monetize, and we're trying to build long-term franchises. And we're pretty excited about where that's going. Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Two questions for you. First, the guidance for the fourth quarter. If you sort of parse out what was implied off last quarter's guidance and where we are now, is much of the change \u2013 the $0.05 impact to the downside \u2013 is a lot of that just because of Mass Effect having a later-in-the-quarter release date? Is it FX? Or is there something else? And then, secondly, just from a big picture macro perspective, overall retail had a very difficult December quarter. And game stop included, but all of retail in general, foot traffic was way down. And I'm curious, seeing that, does that maybe get you to focus more on accelerating the digital migration and trying to get people to do more full game digital downloads? How do you read those tea leaves over the next one to two years? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. So, first, on guidance. I remind everybody we started the year with using, if you refer back to our translated, back to the non-GAAP guidance that \u2013 in the way we've given it. Historically, we started the year at $3.50, we raised it to $3.65, and we've just now raised it to $3.80. So, I wouldn't get overly hung up on how that's phased by quarter. We had an extremely strong third quarter, much stronger than we thought. That gives us caution around the fourth quarter, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. And thus we've held the top line essentially flat using those old measures or our net sales measure. But we've passed through a large portion of that on the bottom line because we're very confident about the profitability and the ongoing profitability of the business. We're also investing in the future, and so you see that in the OpEx number. That's not just for the quarter, that's for titles that are coming in the coming years to come, both in terms of marketing and development expenses. On the digital side, I think we're focused on doing everything we can to deliver the best games and the best experience for our consumers. And if the consumer chooses to do that digitally or through physical, we don't spend a lot of time worrying about that, we're just trying to deliver great experiences. But critical to those experiences are the ongoing live services, we're running events every week, we're bringing people back every week, and those experiences are all developed digitally and delivered digitally. And that's where we think the future of the business continues to go. And so, that means less and less about individual games sold and more and more about engagement in the games. I don't know how that ultimately plays out to the retailers out there, but our focus is on really deepening the engagement for the consumer and delivering that in a way that's the easiest way for the consumer, which is digitally. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Right. Thanks, Blake. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, Andrew and Blake. Congrats on your quarter. Two questions from me. Curious on the fiscal 2018 slate. The transparency that you gave us, Andrew, is that sort of a full slate now? Or are there some games unannounced? There's been some recent chatter on maybe Skate 4, and I think you also sort of were thinking about remasters as possibilities for fiscal 2018. And the second question, curious if you've seen or maybe worry about physical retail over buying product as it may be underappreciate share loss of full game download, and if you think that's creating or could create sort of an elevated promotional burden as retail attempts to create channel. Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I'll take the first part. So, the slate we talked about today, you should see, is our core foundational slate. There are always other things that we might do depending on what the market looks like, whether it's remasters or otherwise. But you should see that as our core foundational slate. Much to the dismay of the many people that email me on a fairly regular basis, we are not presently making Skate 4, and so that will not be in fiscal year 2018. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Despite my disappointment, it's one of my favorite titles. So, in terms of \u2013 and I think to add to that, we always can add a few things during the year, maybe something gets pulled in faster than we thought, or we move something out of test in mobile more than we thought. But I think for purposes of guidance, we really wanted to give people a full understanding of the master slate that we're planning. So, don't assume that there's another big title looming out there that's going to drop into the year. In terms of the retail channel, I'll remind you guys that we reserve upfront, it's the difference between our gross sales and our net sales. What you see is net sales, above that we reserve sales reserve to make sure that we have plenty of money available to keep the channel clean. And that results in planned promotions during the year, around specific holidays, or events, or launches, or whatever it might be. And our process is to make sure we work with the retailers to keep that channel clean. So, we're not worried about it. And we watch it very carefully because it's critical to make sure that they're successful as well as we're successful. And so, I don't think that there's any issues that are different than we've seen in the last 5 or 10 years on that. Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think that's the last question. I appreciate it. We'll talk to everyone else \u2013 or everyone in the coming months. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Our fourth quarter of FY 2017 was an excellent finish to a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. Revenue, gross margin, earnings and cash flow were all above our guidance for the fiscal year, driven by strong and continuing player engagement across our portfolio of top-quality titles for console, mobile and PC. EA's games today are live services \u2013 amazing experiences that we update and evolve to deliver ongoing fun that keeps players engaged, connects them to their friends, brings them more content and grows our network. This strategy has been at the core of our digital transformation, and today our live services are some of the strongest and most vibrant in the industry. Battlefield 1 continued its outstanding start, with more than 19 million players joining the game through the end of FY 2017, a 50% increase over Battlefield 4 in the same period from launch. Our community of Battlefield fans is growing as new players join loyal franchise fans, driving engagement and player satisfaction levels to be among the highest in our portfolio. Our in-game Battlefield network now helps players move seamlessly from game to game in the franchise, finding their friends and connecting with the content to maximize the experience every time they play. FIFA 17 expanded the reach of the world's biggest sports gaming franchise, with more than 21 million players jumping in to the game through the end of FY 2017. Our creative teams, with the benefit of data and analytics from our network, delivered The Journey \u2013 our new story mode in FIFA 17 that has engaged more than 12 million players to date. With story mode having brought in many new players, we also saw more of our players go deeper. Our FIFA Ultimate Team player base grew 13% year-over-year through the end of Q4. Ultimate Team is also the gateway to our esports competitions for both Madden NFL and FIFA. Within the broader Ultimate Team communities, more than 10 million players participated in competitive matches in the first year of our tournaments, and our global spectator audience continues to grow. On mobile, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes continues to tap into the passionate Star Wars fan base, maintaining one of the most engaged player communities across our entire network. With a constant cadence of in-game events and new content drops, including new Rogue One characters, the average time played per day increased to a record 162 minutes in Q4, and player satisfaction levels are reaching new heights. Across our top mobile titles, we are driving thousands of live events per quarter, deepening the experiences and connecting players through guilds, challenges and content to fuel their passions. Our Sims franchise continues to expand one of the broadest and most demographically diverse player bases in our portfolio. The Sims 4, now two-and-a-half year since launch, saw monthly active players increase 33% year-over-year in Q4. With a total of seven downloadable content packs delivered throughout the year, as well as game updates that offered more choice and fan-requested features, The Sims 4 community is thriving. Games as a service are reshaping our industry, and EA is positioned to lead. Our investment in EA digital platform that connects players across games, franchise and devices, also provides more data from our games than ever before. With the data and capabilities of our platform, we're able to do things differently, move faster, and innovate for our player communities. Amazingly creative games combined with services like Ultimate Team, our Battlefield network, multi-platform experiences and subscription programs like EA Access are the future of this industry. With every player that joins our games, every game session, and every engagement in our live services, we are adding strength to EA's Player Network. In FY 2018, we'll deliver more thrilling experiences that broaden the reach of our major franchises and drive deeper engagement through more ways to play. Our EA SPORTS portfolio continues to have the biggest player community in sports games, and this year we'll add new experiences to grow that audience. Madden NFL 18 is set to be the most innovative Madden title in more than a decade, using the full Frostbite stack to deliver new modes that bring the sport to life in unprecedented ways. FIFA 18 will expand on The Journey and Ultimate Team, and we'll connect to more soccer fans with FIFA as our first title on Nintendo Switch. With new NHL, NBA LIVE and UFC console games, as well as more live events and content for our growing EA SPORTS player base on mobile, our multi-platform EA SPORTS portfolio is set to reach more fans around the world in FY 2018. We're also incredibly excited to bring Star Wars Battlefront II to the massive Star Wars community later this year. This game is made possible by the collaboration of three incredibly talented studios \u2013 DICE, Motive and Criterion \u2013 bringing together their individual strengths and building on the feedback from our passionate fans. Star Wars Battlefront II will have more than three times the content of the previous game at launch, with a brand new story, a new single-player campaign, new modes, characters, vehicles and planets from all eras in the Star Wars universe, as well as a live service plan that will continue to add even more fun for the global community. Our Star Wars Battlefront II debut trailer has generated more than 16 million views across YouTube and other social platforms, and we'll have much more to share about this game in the weeks and months to come. This will be a year of pioneering and creativity across many of EA's top franchises. Every Battlefield 1 player will have more ways to play throughout the year, with continual game updates, new maps, and three more expansion packs adding new armies, regions and battlegrounds available to the whole community. We're just getting started with our live service plans for this massive game, and later this year, we'll introduce new ways for players to get an even bigger Battlefield 1 experience. Two of our other genre-leading franchises will also see new titles this year. The industry's biggest multi-platform racing franchise, Need for Speed, returns to console and PC with a brand-new title that will give racers vast customization and more freedom to race wherever they want. And on mobile, our Sims franchise has been a genre leader since launch, and this year we're going to deliver a brand new, deeply social experience for this wide-reaching global community. Competitive gaming and esports will be a key growth factor for us throughout FY 2018 as we expand the ways that fans can play and watch. Year two of our FIFA and Madden NFL championships will kick off this fall, featuring millions of competitive games through Ultimate Team, deeper partnerships with leagues and teams that add new dimensions to the tournaments, and new venues for our major global championships. Later this year, we'll launch our first Battlefield 1 competition, unlocking the competitive spirit that runs deep in our Battlefield community. We're also continuing to expand our broadcast reach and content portfolio for our growing spectator audience. There is global excitement for our competitions, and this year we'll broadcast our tournaments and add additional programming through more major network partnerships including ESPN, BT Sport, Univision and more. Looking forward, we will continue our aggressive pace of innovation through experiences that capitalize on our technology, network and creativity. We are very pleased with the progress of our new action IP from BioWare. The design is stunning, gameplay mechanics are excellent, and the action will be exhilarating. This game is built around a live service, and through our creative process, we've decided to add more to the disruptive new social designs for our players. To accommodate that, we are moving the launch date for this project into Fiscal Year 2019. Through FY 2019 and beyond, our portfolio will continue to grow. There'll be more new experiences for our Battlefield fans. Our Star Wars action-adventure IP from Visceral will make its debut, and farther out, we'll have a new Star Wars title from our partners at Respawn. We continue to invest deeply in new IP, including the new game from BioWare and another project from our Motive Studio. With Frostbite powering more of our EA SPORTS games, we'll continue to break barriers and lead sports across all platforms. And on mobile, we have titles from more of our major IP in development. Electronic Arts is leading the industry with some of the most creative, sophisticated and engaging entertainment available anywhere in the world. Yet we are building towards a far more powerful and connected future. As engagement and consumption patterns across platforms and business models continue to evolve, we are investing in our network to keep players connected to each other and the games they love. Our focus on esports continue to draw more players and spectators to the excitement of competition in our games. Our subscription services like EA Access are providing more fun and tremendous value. And with the unification of our engine and our platform, as well as major advancements in deep learning, AI and social layers, we are unlocking new ways to connect players and personalize their experiences at scale. This is the future of play that we see at Electronic Arts, and that we are ready to lead. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. At the beginning of fiscal 2017, at our Investor Day, we outlined to you the long-term trajectory of our business. We said we would invest in our player network, advance our live services, grow our digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business than ever before. I'm delighted to say we're delivering on all of those commitments, and we are making the right investments to continue along this trajectory. Net revenue for the year was $4.8 billion, cost of revenue $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.2 billion. Most importantly, these results enabled us to deliver record operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion. We also returned over half a billion dollars to shareholders through our repurchase program in fiscal 2017. Total net sales for the year were $4.9 billion, a record. Digital net sales accounted for 61% of this, up 6 percentage points year on year. Extra content was a record $1.3 billion, with Ultimate Team contributing $832 million. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter : GAAP net revenue was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. Cost of revenue was $202 million, down from $226 million last year, a significant improvement on our guidance of $242 million. Operating expenses were $608 million, $17 million above our expectation, driven by an advance write-off of a licensing agreement. This resulted in an earnings per share of $1.81. As Chris mentioned, to compare this year's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please see the new tabs in the downloadable model. Net cash provided by operating activities was $407 million. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year was $1.38 billion, the highest in company history and 13% greater than last year's. Fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures were $123 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.26 billion. Please see our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.53 billion, with 37% of this balance held onshore. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $125 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the $1 billion, two-year buyback program we began in May 2015 with an additional $30.8 million of repurchases. Average cost per share over the two years of the program was $72.66. Looking forward, we announced today a new $1.2 billion, two-year stock repurchase program. Now, turning to net sales to discuss our business drivers for the quarter : Net sales were $1.09 billion, above our guidance of $1.075 billion, and 18% higher than last year. This excludes $53 million of net sales related to premium editions of Mass Effect Andromeda that we had originally expected to be captured in Q4. They will now be captured in Q1. Digital delivered $885 million of the $1.09 billion in net sales, up from $712 million last year. This growth is driven by the ongoing digital transition, as more players choose digital purchases over physical, as well as by our ongoing success with event-driven live services such as FIFA Ultimate Team. Diving into digital net sales : Extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $405 million, up 31% over the prior year. The key element remains Ultimate Team, which grew 23% year-on-year, or 29% at constant currency. Expansion Packs for The Sims 4 also made a strong contribution. Our ability to engage players through live services and events continue to drive strong growth and deliver dependable on-going sales. Our mobile business delivered $175 million in net sales, flat year on year. Key mobile games driving the sales in the quarter were Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, FIFA Online 3 Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and FIFA Mobile. The growth in these games was offset by a slowdown in some of our legacy titles. We're doubling down on live services and events across the mobile portfolio, and the strategy is paying off. For example, FIFA Mobile just had its best-ever month since launch in October. Full-game downloads added $192 million in net sales for the quarter, up 43% year on year. For fiscal 2017, for the current generation of consoles, full-game downloads accounted for 33% of unit sales to consumers, considerably ahead of the 29% we had forecast and 9 percentage points up year on year. The chief driver was the continuing evolution of consumer behavior, but some of the outperformance was driven by the shift from Star Wars Battlefront to Battlefield 1, as well as the digital performance of our catalog. As a result, we continue to believe the underlying trend is closer to 5 percentage points per year. Finally, subscription, advertising and other digital net sales totaled $113 million, up 19% over the same period last year. EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow strongly. In conclusion for Q4, we were able to exceed our expectations for revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating the power of multiple live services revenue streams. Now, turning to our expectations for fiscal 2018 : we expect sales of current generation consoles to continue to be strong, with the installed base growing to 105 million consoles by the end of calendar 2017, up from 79 million the prior year. We expect PC gaming to decline slightly, and the mobile market to grow in the high teens in calendar 2017. Guidance for fiscal 2018 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.1 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion (18:24-18:55) in our statement of cash flow. They do not impact our total cash and cash flow, but they do increase our operating cash flow and decrease our cash flow from financing activities. For fiscal 2017, applying the new rules would increase reported operating cash flow by $195 million and decrease financing cash flow by the same amount. A table presenting the impact is included in our earnings release. For fiscal 2018, applying the new rules, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.6 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to be around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.5 billion. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net sales for the year to be $5.1 billion, up 3% year on year. This is driven by growth in Ultimate Team, mobile and Star Wars Battlefront II. It is offset by the success of Battlefield 1 last year and by FX. The stronger dollar represents a headwind of around $110 million to fiscal year end net sales. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into key drivers of our full-year net sales guidance : Net sales of packaged goods and other is forecasted to be approximately $1.7 billion, down 10% year on year, driven by the shift to digital. Digital net sales are expected to contribute $3.4 billion, up 11% year on year. Breaking down digital sales further : Our mobile business is expected to grow between 5% and 10%, led by the new Sims experience and continued growth from FIFA Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. Net sales from full-game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%, driven by the underlying change in consumer behavior, offset by the fact that Star Wars Battlefront may skew slightly less digital (21:00-21:31) services are in a given franchise. In fiscal 2018, we expect to see net sales of live services to grow between 10% to 15%, led by Ultimate Team and Battlefield 1. As Andrew mentioned, we have made the decision to move our new BioWare action title out of fiscal 2018 and into fiscal 2019. We're very excited about this opportunity for a new franchise and we want to further develop the live service component. Focusing on Q1 : we're expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.425 billion, GAAP cost of revenue of $157 million and GAAP EPS of $1.93. We expect Q1 net sales to be $750 million, up 10% year on year, driven by Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1 and Ultimate Team. At the beginning of our year, at our Investor Day, we shared our long-term vision for the company. It provided context and framework for a very specific set of near-term goals we gave you in our annual guidance. Our fiscal 2017 performance demonstrated how our vision generates excellent financial results and supports growing our cash return to investors. But we are only just beginning to leverage the potential of our player network and event-driven live services. As we continue to do so, we will build a deeper player base and engagement, grow digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. We are at a powerful point in EA's journey. The investments we've made in our IP, our technology platform, and our live service strategy uniquely position EA to lead in a networked world that spans more players, platforms, and geographies than ever before. At our core, we are a creative company. We are game makers that love to capture the imagination and make extraordinary entertainment possible for our players. We're also unique in that we have a unified, world-class technology platform and engine that provide the backbone of our network. Our studio teams are leveraging more sophisticated data and insights, secure and scalable infrastructure, and new game (23:41-24:10) and streaming in the future. With every experience, we are working to bring our players even closer. Constant community input is part of our creative process today : from developer feedback sessions and continual dialogue with community influencers, to the gameplay data that helps us tune and optimize, to community test environments where we can share our latest innovations. Putting our games into the hands of our players \u2013 like we will at EA PLAY in Hollywood in June \u2013 helps to keep us moving, evolving, and constantly pushing for more breakthroughs. We're continually engaging, expanding and strengthening our network by keeping players at the center of everything we do at Electronic Arts. As we deliver more groundbreaking experiences, and deepen the engagement of our global player base, the EA Player Network is how we create greater value through a connected world of play. Every day, the global community of gaming is expanding \u2013 through more devices, more games, and more ways to play. Our EA Player Network will enable players to navigate, to find their friends and engage in more of the experiences that matter to them most. Through persistent experiences and user interfaces like our Battlefield network, to playing and viewing esports competitions, to discovery of new content that adds to the fun, the EA Player Network is already helping to deliver a more personal and connected gaming world for our players, and we're just getting started. We're looking forward to another year of growth and leadership for Electronic Arts. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Operator, if we could open for questions now, please. Operator : Certainly. We'll pause for just a brief moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question is from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Blake, in your guidance you talk about gross margins, looks like being up. Can you talk about the Star Wars impact there? And then maybe also how the other digital content is kind of helping the margins in the year. So kind of frame those two inputs this year into the gross margin outlook. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Justin. Before I do that I wanted to make just a quick announcement about our IR team. Carolyn, who almost all of you, I think, have met or know, has been with us for three years and is moving to our corporate FP&A team, which is a great move for her, and we thank Carolyn for an amazing three years of support to all of the investors and sell-side analysts. We have a new person joining the team, Erin. You'll get a chance to meet her in the coming months and we look forward to having her on our team. But thanks to Carolyn. So to your question, Justin, first, if you look back to the difference between the year before the first Star Wars, fiscal 2015 and then fiscal 2016, you saw a fairly muted growth in gross margin, up about 50 basis points roughly. We expect a similar effect this year because of the impact of the royalty on a very large title as we saw last time. And the comparison was, remember this year a pretty tough comp because our gross margin was actually higher than we had originally anticipated because we sold more Battlefield than we anticipated and less Titanfall than we anticipated. Titanfall obviously has a royalty to Respawn and we expected that, but we got a little bit more bump in gross margin We will see gross improvement as we continue to grow the live service part of our business, Ultimate Team and other similar live services on top of existing games. But for now we're only expecting a little less than 100 basis points or around 50 basis points because of that, primarily of that impact on Star Wars Battlefront II. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question, operator. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Blake, can you just talk a little bit about your view on esports and kind of your esports strategy? There's some people regarding going \u2013 and how do you think about monetizing esports the next couple of years? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about your expectations and guidance for FIFA Ultimate Team off of the pretty tough comps and the great performance from last year? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure. I'll let Andrew address the broader esports strategy. I think the thing to remember is it's built around Ultimate Team for our core sports games and we'll most likely build it around in a similar style live service for non-sports games in the future. But I'll let Andrew talk little bit about that. I'll come back on the Ultimate Team question. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. We're very excited about our esports strategy and what we're doing, and what we saw this year in both FIFA and Madden were significantly higher engagement and monetization inside of Ultimate Team for those competing in esports tournaments. And again, this isn't just about the big championship tournaments. We run a whole series of events at a grassroots level all the way up to the elite level of tournaments. And so we think about this in a similar way that we think about all sports, which is we want to make stars of all of our players, the novice player as well as the professional player. And while there will almost certainly be solid revenue generation from broadcast rights, from sponsorship, from advertising, from players and teams and the monetization of those things, the lion share of the revenue will always be the digital transactions that exist in the ecosystem. We see that in leading esports tournaments and leading esports games already. And what we have seen in FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team over the past 12 months confirms what our original strategy was, which was we will drive those other things. We will benefit from those other things. The lion share of return will come from the ongoing engagement and live service component that is things like Ultimate Team. And you should expect as we launch other esports games that they will also revolve around a very robust and rich digital ecosystem similar to Ultimate Team. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And in terms of guidance relative to Ultimate Team, the thing to remember that was \u2013 two major drivers in FIFA this year were, first, the addition of a story mode in the game. The Journey brought new people into the game and brought those people from the game into Ultimate Team. So it grew the overall base of people playing in Ultimate Team. The second is the addition of the competitive gaming mode inside of FIFA which, as Andrew mentioned, drove massive engagement around tournaments and around practicing for tournaments. Both of those styles of change we're going to try to adapt into Madden in one way or another, and you'll see more of that coming in the coming months. But you can assume we've learned a lot of great lessons from FIFA. We'll try to drive Madden Ultimate Team and Madden Competitive Gaming off of similar modes. But FIFA doesn't sit still. It continues to find new ways to engage people in new modes and new excitement, and as Andrew said, we'll be evolving The Journey in FIFA, which will continue to bring new people into the game, we believe. That's the core. Now our guidance doesn't anticipate anywhere near the level of growth that we actually achieved this year. We tend to do that each year with FIFA because while it's very predictable based around events, we've continued to surprise ourselves on the upside. So you should trust that it's a rational number in terms of our guidance, but there is growth in there. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, Andrew, I think the decision to add The Journey to FIFA was based on user feedback, and that seems to be yielding dividends. So what kind of user feedback have you gathered from the first iteration of Battlefront that you will be looking to add to Battlefront II. And, Blake, will you give us a sense of what percent of your mobile bookings are growing with the new games? And what percent of your bookings are from the legacy games that are now in decline? So wondering when we'll mathematically see a change in the growth trajectory as the mix changes. Thanks Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So, thank you. As you know, Battlefront I was a great game, and widely regarded as the best way to fulfill your Star Wars fantasies. Frostbite really brought the Star Wars universe to life, but there were some things that a number of players asked for. A single player campaign was probably the number one thing that players asked for, and you heard that we'll be doing that. And I'm very excited by what we're seeing there. The Motive Studios who is a collection of developers who have a tremendous track record in building action-adventure and single player campaigns is putting that together. They wanted things like space battles and more vehicles and more heroes and more eras and more planets, and what you heard from us is that it will have all of those things. We took the feedback very, very seriously. We've invested in a very meaningful way, and when we say we believe the game is three times the size in terms of content, we're very serious about that. And our expectation is that the large, engaged passionate fan base of Star Wars fans around the world are going to love everything that we're doing. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of mobile, our net sales for the year were up 10% year-on-year. We're not happy with that. We think we can continue to grow that more, but I remind people that we didn't bring out NBA mobile and FIFA mobile until the back half of the year in October, essentially, and we've continued to learn and tune those games around the world. So we should continue to see more growth out of those. We've had some amazing performers like the Simpsons : Tapped Out or Real Racing or Sims FreePlay that are in year four or year five of their lives and the fact that they're still going is pretty impressive relative to many mobile games. But we will see a natural decline in some of those as we add less content and move to players to new, more exciting games or new versions of those games. And so, I don't know when you're going to see a more dramatic growth level. We've guided to around 5% to 10% of growth for the year, but we certainly are focused on trying to drive the new Sims title, as Andrew mentioned, as well as the sports titles because we feel that those are fabulous formula that we've been able to develop and leverage, both on the console and PC world as well as now in the mobile world. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tim O'shea with Jefferies. Timothy Larkin O'shea - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a few more on Star Wars Battlefront II. So the first installment sold around 13 million units in its launch window. Obviously, a very number. Is this the right framework to use as we think about how to model Battlefront II? And then, there's been a bit of confusion on how you intend to support the game post-launch and I just was hoping you might clarify what we should expect in terms of season pass or DLC. And then, just broadly speaking at a higher level, how is the anticipation for that game shaping up? What's the feedback you're seeing around the announcement of the single-player campaign and the trailer? Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So again, in terms of, we'll start from the back. The fan anticipation has been very, very strong; 16 million organic views. That's not us paying the viewers. That is fans seeking out the content. I would say the feedback has been almost entirely positive. The inclusion of a single-player campaign, the inclusion of a new heroine in Iden, space battles, new content, new heroes, new world, new planets. I think the feedback of that is very, very strong. As we think about the live services, nothing \u2013 I'm not talking in great deal about it now other than, the game is going to be three times the size of the original game at launch and we also have a very, very robust live services plan that we're going to talk about in the coming weeks and months, particularly around EA PLAY and E3 in just a few weeks' time. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. And I think on the unit forecast, we sold 14 million units of Battlefront I in the year it was shipped and built into our guidance as essentially the same number. Our aspirations are clearly to sell more. We think this will appeal to not just the broad Star Wars fan base, but also to the deep, heavily-engaged Battlefield fan base and Battlefront fan base. And we see that as a critical part of the success of this game going forward and as Andrew mentioned, we've got the depth and the breadth in the games that will help that. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question's from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on mobile. I wanted to know if we could tease-out a little bit about where you saw strength in mobile versus some of the legacy titles that might have been a drag on mobile just so we can tease-out some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the Mobile business. And then second, any sense of marketing and how it's being impacted in terms of trying to drive mobile engagement? Is there any change there, or you're actually leaning in against some of the key titles on the mobile engagement front? Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Eric. The core product portfolio that's been there for four or five years like the Simpsons I mentioned, have actually shrunk. Games like Sims FreePlay have stayed fairly consistent but not grown dramatically. And then things like FIFA, NBA, and particularly Galaxy of Heroes have grown dramatically. And so, I think what you'll see as we layer in games like the new Sims game and the sports games continue to grow, you'll continue to see that hopefully offset any of the shrinkage in the older portfolio. Those numbers for the older portfolio are starting to get fairly small and stable, and so I don't think you'll see a lot of headwind from that. In terms of marketing. We're continuing a very ROI-driven marketing approach that's got a lot of discipline around it. We have a whole team led by our Chief Marketing Officer that focuses not just on our console and PC marketing, but very much on the mobile marketing. And they're driving decisions almost daily as to how to support the products. That's the beauty of the business is, when something's working well you can tune up the daily marketing. When it's not, you can tune it down. I would say, though, that we remain very focused on leveraging known IP that we own or license to try to offset some of the costs of marketing and has allowed us to run our mobile business at a level of profitability we believe higher than most, as well as, driven by the fact we're spending less on ROI-driven marketing. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wonder if you guys could comment on your experience with Battlefield 1 DLC. What the conversion rate was in the March quarter and what your expectations are for fiscal 2018? I believe you guys had four maps launching this fiscal period. And then second question is more a clarification. Your commentary on full-game downloads being 9% last year, but moving back to 5%, is that a number for the company or something you expect the industry to trend at? And if it's not for you, where would you expect it to be given the Star Wars versus Battlefield dynamic? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So thanks, Drew. The first question on Battlefield 1. We're not going to disclose attach rates because they're becoming less and less meaningful, particularly in a world of live services. And you'll see some changes to our approach, particularly with Battlefield and Battlefront over time that makes those DLC less important because it's ongoing content that's being delivered. I will say, you'll also see a lot of content delivered to the broad community for Battlefield, not just for the DLC owners going forward, which I think will continue to make those numbers a little less meaningful. We're very pleased with the engagement levels on Battlefield, as well as the ongoing sales of Battlefield 1, and we think that will continue on. And I guess what I would say is, based on having seen some of the DLCs, I would never refer to them as a map. We've got a lot of exciting stuff coming and a lot of interesting things about World War I that have yet to be even seen. In terms of full-game downloads. The number surprised us because we had thought that it'd be around the 5% year-over-year growth. Some of that may simply be the consumer is shifting faster than we know or we expected. The trends can sometimes jump in dramatic ways and maybe we're starting to see that overall shift. And some of it could be product-related. We do think the industry will end calendar year 2017 probably above 40%. We will most likely lag that as we have historically because FIFA is such a large product and it is so global that we are operating in markets where either the ability to purchase digitally, or the ability to download based on bandwidth speeds, are compromised and thus we tend to skew a little lower on FIFA than we do on the rest of our portfolio. So we've always lagged the industry slightly, but we are excited about the potential that you're seeing the consumer possibly shift quicker to digital than we'd originally anticipated. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question's from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I've just got two quick ones. Around Battlefield 1, it seems like the excitement around the game is a little bit better than you expected. Has that changed your view on the intensity or the strategy around extra content for this fiscal year? And then, could we see more in the following fiscal year to support Battlefield 1? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I would say it hasn't really changed our overall approach for this fiscal year. You may see some things you didn't actually anticipate as it evolves, but the general strategy is still based around quarterly or monthly DLCs that we put out. I do think you'll start to see that evolve next year as we get into more competitive gaming and it will clearly evolve, as Andrew mentioned, around Battlefront II property that we start to evolve the services associated with DLC to make them more live service, event-driven style gameplay versus purely an additional piece of content. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): On that particular comment, if I may, are you kind of leaning towards kind of (44:10-44:18) Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: You cut out. Operator : Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Doris, why don't go onto the next question? We'll come back to Andrew. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. I think your revenue-deferred adjusted gross margin this quarter was a bit over 81%, which is I think more than 400 basis points higher than your previous high in any quarter you've reported. Obviously, you had a big digital mix this quarter. But there's been other quarters in the last couple of years where you've had similar digital mix, and the gross margins have been in the mid-70%. So wondered if you could talk about \u2013 was there anything special in this quarter that drove the gross margin so high? Mix of business, or anything like that? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. I think primarily the biggest driver I would say is the mix, lower royalty-bearing titles this year versus last year \u2013 Battlefield catalog, for example, versus Battlefront catalog last year. There was also \u2013 the one thing to remember is our technology team, led by Ken Moss, has done an amazing job making our back office ability to deliver digital much more efficient. We don't talk about it a lot, but it's become a continued help in our gross margin as we expand. And we'll continue to drive that. That's lower cost storage, lower cost delivery, more efficient network and platform that we've built it on. It's all pretty powerful, and that continues to help us as well. And then obviously continued digital, as we said, is also a major driver in the business which has helped us in the quarter. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Doris, next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from the line of San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi. It's San. Two questions on my end. How far along are you in building and staffing out Motive Studio in Canada? And how should we think about that impact to the trajectory in R&D expenses over the next two years? And then secondly, can we just get your current thoughts on what areas are most interesting to you in the industry in regards to potential M&A? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So I'm sorry, San. I didn't catch the first part of your first question. Can you repeat the question? San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Oh. Sure. It's just how far along are you in building out and staffing out the Motive Studio in Canada? And basically, what's the impact to the trajectory in R&D? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. Thanks. We're well along the way. We've hired close to 100 people for that studio \u2013 some of the most fabulous talent I've met in many, many years. It's very exciting for us to assemble a brand new team. We're finalizing our new office space there, which will have both Motive people as well as the BioWare Montr\u00e9al team in that same office. We still have some hiring to go, but I think for now it'll be at a more gradual pace over the next couple of years as we move probably from, say, 100 to 150 or so as we go forward, so. But it's been exciting to be able to build such a great new team. And in terms of the second piece on M&A, I think there are few large companies out there, and most of the companies are small. Many of the companies we've looked at we've passed on because the valuations have been so high, but we're continuing to keep our eyes and ears open, particularly for things that could add to either games that don't have live services and we can layer live services into them or games that could leverage our network and our scale that we don't have. And those will be big themes for us, but unfortunately, it's not a long list of companies that are out there of scale that we can go after. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our next question is the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. Couple quick ones here. Despite moving out an entire title, guidance is quite solid on a tough comp, and then your digital guidance is up nicely, even with Star Wars, which last time was a bit of a drag on digital. So would you say that the biggest component of the favorable overall guide and digital guide is mostly the result of strength of Battlefield 1 live services? Or would you attribute it to something else? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I would probably attribute it to live services in general, so not just Battlefield, but the overall portfolio, both mobile and non-mobile where we're trying to layer more live services and are seeing success. We're seeing obviously \u2013 we have expectations for growth across the sports portfolio, both in HD and in mobile. We do have a new UFC game, I think as everyone knows, next spring and we have the Need for Speed game coming in. So all of those add to the growth in the year, despite the fact that we have a tough comp to try to beat between Battlefield, Titanfall and the strength of FIFA this past year. So we see it as kind of growth across the whole portfolio versus dominated by one product or one new product. And we do have the new Sims game that Andrew mentioned that's coming out during the year on mobile. We don't know exactly what time of year that will come out, so we don't have a giant expectation in the guidance, but that's clearly in there as well. Operator : Our next question's from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me as well. Curious if you could give us a deeper perspective, I guess on what's happening within BioWare. Mass Effect I think from a quality perspective didn't exactly hit the mark and it looks like we've now delayed the anticipated new IP which sometimes is also tied to quality. So curious if there's any change in leadership or developer turnover. What sort of cap internally within BioWare? And then second question's PopCap. It looks like you have some layoffs in that studio. Obviously, that studio has good IP, used to, as well as [talent]. I'm sort of curious how you see the future of PopCap. And also with tinkering with head count on the overall firm or any trends there we should think about through fiscal 2018. Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So let me just make sure that was only two questions and not three or four. The first one is what's going on with BioWare; and should we read anything in from Mass Effect to the new title? So that's that collection of questions. And the question was what's going on at PopCap and should we read anything in there? Was there a third question about head count overall? Or was that just head count related to PopCap? Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We lost Mike now. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Mike? Operator : Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'll answer... Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Only the first two. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And we'll go from there. The first thing is, is Mass Effect is an interesting title. It was in development for a really long time and represented a lot of the great things that BioWare is known for : story, size, depth, breadth, imagination. And while overall, the aggregate review scores were lower than we would have liked, we did have over 100 reviewers score the game at 80 or higher. So it represents a fan base that's very passionate; looking for very particular things. And many players found exactly what they're looking for and some players did not. With that said, we believe Mass Effect Andromeda delivers a rich, deep experience which celebrates what makes the franchise great : wonderful, beautiful, deep rich worlds, amazing combat and engaging fast-paced, multiplayer. New multiplayer content is continuing to be released and new content kind of arriving overall more regularly so. We're very happy with kind of how BioWare is doing, how BioWare is treating Mass Effect. And our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall. In terms of the new IP, the choice to move the new IP and what happened with Mass Effect are completely unrelated. The realities is we have a creative process. As a company, creativity and pioneering is really important for us. Now, innovation in games is important more now than ever. And as a leader in the industry, we see it as our responsibility to innovate. And as part of our creative process \u2013 and I get to be involved in that creative process \u2013 we recognize that there was so much more opportunity in a connected network social world to do some things in the new BioWare game that had never done before and we don't think anyone is going to do anytime soon. But by virtue of our network, our cross-platform presence and our scale, we think we can do that. And we chose to give the team some more time to deliver against that innovation because we believe players are looking for the kinds of things that we plan to put into that game. And so we're very happy with BioWare. BioWare has continued to support Mass Effect, and the new team is doing some amazing things, and you'll hear more about that in the months to come. In terms of PopCap, again, I think there's a couple of different presence for PopCap. We have an amazing PopCap team in Vancouver that built Garden Warfare 1 and 2 on consol. That game continues to do extremely well, high critical acclaim, strong engagement, and strong sales over its life, so we're very happy with that team. The team's building against Mobile Games out of Seattle, recognize that the market continues to change, that brands are really important in the mobile space, but so is focus. And the notion of building lots of small things really doesn't pay out the way it does in mobile like it did just a few years ago. And their decision was to refocus and really energize around a few core PopCap IP and that drove a slight change in structure there. But you shouldn't read into anything other than we are very, very committed to PopCap and very committed to PopCap IP, and very committed to bringing that wonderful IP to players across devices in the future. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Our last question is from the line of Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks. So what are your expectations for this next edition of Madden as it moves to Frostbite? And are there any potential synergies that you guys are thinking about for moving the game to that engine? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: What Frostbite allows us to do, as you can see what it allowed on FIFA is to have a much deeper experience, much better graphics, doing things inside the game that you couldn't do on a sports engine. So if you were to look at FIFA and say, how did FIFA change year-over-year, you'll probably see similar aspects of that in Madden. And we're pretty excited about it. It looks fantastic so far. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. And then, Andrew, in your remarks you called out AI and I'm just wondering how are you utilizing it now. And I use that term broadly. And how do you see it evolving over the next couple of years? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We see kind of on three core vectors. Again, we make artificial humans inside of video games and have been doing that for many decades, and the sophistication of those human beings inside of our games continues to grow. And so we have a lot of energy about how do we improve the AI of our characters inside games so that their performance is far more believable and far more human. A second vector is just how we think about pathing and difficulty inside of our games, so with the growing population of players across devices, the notion that one size fits all with respect to experience is no longer relevant. And so we have a lot of work going into how we think about a dynamic experience, a dynamic and personalized experience for every single player in our network, even as they play the same games with their friends on similar devices. And it's really about how do we change difficulty level, how do we change pathing, how do we provide the tools and feedback that those players need so that they can get the single best experience and ultimately engage with the game longer. And then the third vector, of course, is just how we think about recommendations and presentation of content and merchandising of content and marketing of the content that we produce to a global player base. We have deep investment going on in all three vectors. We think we're leading in a number of categories. A lot of that will start to manifest itself inside of our EA Player Network. You're already seeing some of that in Ultimate Team, in our Sims games, in our Battlefield network that moves you amongst experiences. And we believe that in the not-too-distant future that's going to be a meaningful vector of growth for our business. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So one last question. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. How are you guys thinking now about the Nintendo Switch post launch? And is this in your new Gen console installed base forecast? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So we feel really good about it. Again, we came out early and said that we'll be supporting the Nintendo Switch with our biggest title in FIFA. We have a tremendous relationship with Nintendo and have done for many, many years and are excited by the fact that they have come out very strong and are bringing in a whole new player base into the ecosystem. We continue to be bullish on it and are looking at other titles that we might bring to the Switch. Our console number that we quoted does not include the Switch at this point, so anything that Nintendo does is additive to that number. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great. Thank you, everyone. We'll see you in the coming months, and talk to you next quarter. Appreciate the interest. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Our first quarter of FY 2018 was an outstanding start to an exciting year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our live services across console, PC, and mobile was exceptional, demonstrating the strength of our digital business that evolves daily to meet the needs of our players. Revenue and EPS for the quarter were above our guidance, and we had our highest Q1 operating cash flow in EA history. Our live services today continue to grow with more passionate players connecting with their friends through our network and having more fun with the games they love. Our EA SPORTS live services were thriving through Q1, engaging more players on multiple platforms. Unique players in Ultimate Team grew 11% year-over-year through Q1. In our mobile businesses, FIFA Mobile expanded to more than 95 million unique players, and NBA Live Mobile grew to more than 70 million unique players. Our Sims community continues to be strong. Monthly active players in The Sims 4 increased more than 20% year-over-year in Q1, and we're excited to have a new Sims Mobile game in soft launch. And in Battlefield 1, our community has grown to 21 million unique players experiencing an extensive live service with monthly updates, in-game events and missions and the largest expansion pack in franchise history. As we continue to strengthen player relationship through our live services, we are also innovating with how we reach players outside of our games. Through EA PLAY in June, we engaged a global audience from our event in Hollywood. First, we gave fans the most comprehensive look to-date at our FY 2018 titles, including Star Wars Battlefront II, FIFA 18, Need for Speed Payback, Madden NFL 18, NBA LIVE 18 and a new EA Originals title in A Way Out and our stunning new IP, Anthem. The trailers and videos we launched for our games at EA PLAY have together generated more than 115 million views on social channels, twice as many as last year's content. We welcomed nearly 20,000 players to our venue for a celebration of play and opportunities to go hands-on with our biggest games. Among those attendees were 300 community leaders and content creators who captured and streamed 1,000 hours of gameplay for our upcoming titles. That content is now being shared among a combined 250 million subscribers worldwide, bringing them closer to the new experiences and excitement we will deliver this year. Q1 set the foundation for FY 2018 and there is much more ahead of us, new games, more content, and pioneering for the future of play. At Electronic Arts, we're committed to innovation for our players and the industry. We are pushing the limits forward. Our focus manifests in three key areas that uniquely position EA to lead and drive growth : a core technology base that is unparalleled in our industry; amazing new titles being developed by extraordinary teams; and new models to expand our reach and help more people discover, engage, and enjoy the fun of games. EA's investments in engine technology, analytics, infrastructure, and research continue to fuel advancements in our games, our services, and our Player Network. Our industry-leading Frostbite engine is now powering development of a dozen new titles across our portfolio. It is continually engineered alongside our world-class technology platform for games and services, enabling our creative teams to leverage sophisticated data and insights to conceptualize and build the most incredible new experiences for our players. Our digital platform provides the scalable infrastructure that powers our multi-player experiences, connects players to their friends, and updates our games based on player inputs. And across the company, research teams like SEED are working in areas like neural networks derived from our data sets, cloud infrastructure to deliver streaming experiences, virtual humans, and AI. These concepts will dramatically shape how players interact and experience games over the next five years and beyond. Competitive gaming will also continue to fuel growth and evolution in EA's portfolio. Players in titles like FIFA and Madden NFL are up to three times more engaged when they are playing competitively, and fan feedback from our tournaments has been highly positive. This year, new competitive structures and new modes are set to expand engagement and drive growth in the digital ecosystem, broadcast, and sponsorship. Launching first is Madden NFL, where the size and scope of our competitions in FY 2018 will increase substantially from a strong foundation as we deepen our partnership with the NFL and bring e-sports even closer to the real-world sport. At Gamescom, we'll debut a new way to play Battlefield 1 built for competition and designed with direct input from our Battlefield community. Through a growing portfolio of digital and traditional broadcast deals, our spectator reach will continue to expand, with major brands set to engage this high-value audience through global sponsorships. Looking to our FY 2018 slate of new titles and live services, we are delivering unprecedented levels of innovation. Starting in Q2, FIFA 18 delivers a generational leap forward for the franchise. Frostbite is now enhancing every aspect of the game from visual fidelity to gameplay. The Journey 2 brings a deeper and more personalized story experience, and FIFA Ultimate Team is expanding with the addition of FUT Icons. FIFA's global appeal also continues to grow. FIFA Online in China is one of our fastest growing sports businesses over the past year. Madden NFL will break new ground for the franchise when it launches in August, powered by Frostbite, delivering a unique take on story mode with Longshot and introducing MUT Champions to power our global e-sports competitions. NHL 18 will have the most ways to team up and compete with friends in franchise history, 60 combinations of co-op and online multiplayer, including a brand-new NHL THREES mode. And Battlefield 1 will continue to evolve as a content rich live service, with monthly game updates and our next expansion pack, In The Name of the Tsar, launching in full in September. In addition at Gamescom, we will detail our plan for a new offering that will bring the richest Battlefield 1 experience yet, including the all-out warfare, epic multiplayer battles, and War Stories campaign that have defined the game plus new maps, deeper progression, and additional fan-favorite game modes, all in a single package. In Q3, we'll deliver new games in some of our most popular global IP. Need for Speed Payback will excite fans with its adrenaline-fueled action driving experience, signature car customization, new story, and new characters. Yesterday, we announced that The Sims 4 is coming to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players this November, bringing the same unique gameplay and self-expression from the PC game to console players. Much of the content added post-launch on PC will be included, with more game modes and updates to come. Finally, Star Wars Battlefront II will bring the unforgettable Star Wars experience that fans want, a game three times the size of the previous title with a new single-player story, iconic space battles, deeper multiplayer, and a new event-driven live service model that will keep the community together long after launch. Anticipation and excitement for this game continues to grow. Our trailers and user-generated content for Battlefield II have received more than 117 million views to date, up more than a third from our previous game. We're also focused on growing our reach and encouraging more players around the world. Our live services are continually evolving to connect more players with new experiences, like our unique model for Star Wars Battlefront II post-launch content and event-based modes like FUT Champions. As we continue to expand our competitive gaming program across more IP, we're delivering highly engaging broadcast content for e-sports spectators, one of the fastest-growing audiences in entertainment. And as a publisher, we have pioneered the multi-title subscription service at the platform level with EA Access and Origin Access, enabling players to discover and enjoy more games at tremendous value. Only EA spans this breadth of engagement models today, helping us to reach more players and continually grow our network. There is a lot to be excited about in the quarters to come. We are innovating for our players, for our business, and for the industry. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. We had a great start to the fiscal year, powered by our event-driven live services, particularly FIFA Ultimate Team and our mobile titles. Our operating cash flow was the highest ever for a first quarter and underlines how our growing live services have fundamentally changed our business model, resulting in a more stable and predictable cash flow all year round. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.45 billion, compared to $1.27 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $24 million. Operating expenses were $552 million, $6 million above our guidance due to phasing. The increase over last year was primarily driven by new product development as we invest in new genres. Operating income was $743 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.06, $0.13 above our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $176 million, up $294 million from last year. Remember that the FASB rules regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation have changed, and this affects how we classify our cash flow. Under the old rules, operating cash flow for the first fiscal quarter in 2018 would have been $42 million, up $290 million year-on-year. Under both accounting treatments, operating cash flow was an all-time record for the first quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $143 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.87 billion, our strongest ever 12 months. See our earnings slide for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $150 million, leaving $1.08 billion in our two-year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.47 billion, with 37% of this balance held onshore. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $775 million, up $93 million on the prior year and $25 million above our guidance. There was an FX headwind of approximately $16 million compared to the prior year. The outperformance relative to guidance was driven by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4 and FIFA Online 3. Year-on-year growth was driven by the Mass Effect : Andromeda sales captured in the quarter and by FIFA. Digital net sales were $681 million, a new record for the first quarter and up $113 million on the-year ago period. The increase reflects strength in live services together with our mobile business. In addition, Mass Effect : Andromeda was a significant contributor. Digital sales now represent 63% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis compared to 56% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital sales in turn. Live services net sales were up 22% year-on-year to $420 million. The growth was broad-based, driven by FIFA Ultimate Team, Battlefield 1 and The Sims 4. The e-sports mode and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to attract new players and drive engagement. Notably, Sims 4 expansion packs continue to perform extremely well, and the last 12 months have been the best in the title's history. Both EA Access and Origin Access are up year-on-year. Remember, we've merged extra content and subscriptions, ads, and others into this new live services category. Mobile delivered net sales of $150 million, up 6% year-on-year with the growth primarily from FIFA Mobile, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and NBA Mobile. FIFA Mobile is continuing along its growth trajectory and beat our expectations by delivering its strongest quarter since launch. June was the strongest month so far for FIFA Mobile, a testament to the ability of the team to create compelling live services for players. In Q1 alone, they released two major client upgrades and delivered 10 major content programs. Full game PC and console downloads generated net sales of $111 million, 32% higher than last year. This was driven by Mass Effect : Andromeda sales captured in the quarter. 34% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 27% a year ago. Turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect net revenue of $955 million, cost of revenue to be $389 million and operating expenses of $638 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, primarily due to two factors, continued investment in new genres and live services and the phasing of marketing expenses. Phasing will be different as we start campaigns earlier for new games and live services. This results in a loss per share of $0.18 for the second quarter. Note that this is calculated using the basic share count of 310 million shares. Should EA report a profit, the diluted share count of 314 million will be used. We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $1.16 billion. This is up 5.6% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our sports franchises, offset by a FX headwind of around $18 million. With regard to sports, Madden NFL 18 is a significant step-up from last year's game. It's the first Madden on Frostbite, it's the first with the story mode, and we significantly refined the competitive gaming features in Madden Ultimate Team. FIFA 18 continues the pattern of innovation with the addition of Real Player Motion Technology and player personality and the second season of the journey. Also contributing to our excitement around FIFA is the addition of the Nintendo Switch. We will launch FIFA 18 for all three console platforms at September 29. In conclusion, we are delighted with the performance of our business in the first quarter, driven by the growing revenue streams generated by our live services. We've applied our teams to developing competitive or compelling live service event, and this has fundamentally transformed our business model. Our live services continue to grow our profitability and enable us to generate cash all year round. Now I'll turn the call back over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. The future of games is changing. Over 2.5 billion people are estimated to play video games today, and we expect that number will continue to grow. At that scale, the way we connect to, access and play games will continue to evolve. EA is at the leading edge of that transformation. Our creative teams are applying advanced technologies and better intelligence to craft new experiences like our Longshot Mode in Madden NFL 18 and the massive dynamic environments in Star Wars Battlefront II. But this is just the beginning as we combine the power of our Frostbite engine with our digital platform. With increased processing power on devices and in the cloud, the new frontiers for innovation become deeper forms of personalization, immersive and self-generating worlds, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. As we continue to pioneer for our players, our portfolio will expand in FY 2019 and beyond. We deliver stories that you're able to play like the Star Wars action-adventure game being developed by the Visceral Games team. Anthem, our new IP from BioWare, will introduce a contiguous open world that is ever-changing and influenced by players as they band together and support each other in their journeys. Next year will also be a World Cup year in soccer, an added opportunity for us to innovate and engage our massive FIFA audience around the world. We'll continue delivering for our Battlefield fans, including the next great game in the franchise. Across our top franchises and new IP, our ongoing focus will be on advancing the state-of-the-art in games for players on every platform. Delivering new and compelling ways to discover, engage and enjoy games will enable us to reach more players and grow our network. Our live services will continue to expand, hosting thousands of daily, weekly and seasonal in-game events that brings players in deeper. Our competitive gaming programs from online tournaments to global championship spectacles will engage more players and spectators in our franchises as the massive e-sports audience continues to grow, and through our subscriptions and Origin platform, players will be able to seamlessly connect to new experiences from EA's portfolio and beyond. We are entering a new era for innovation in the games industry. We believe interactive entertainment will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 45 years. And we're excited to lead that evolution at Electronic Arts. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So one of the big announcements at E3 was this new Ultimate Team style mode for Star Wars Battlefront II, where gamers can purchase Star Cards to unlock the special in-game abilities. And you guys are doing over $800 million in Ultimate Team revenue. So my question is how much incremental Ultimate Team style revenue could be generated by Star Wars and then how much is implicitly included in your outlook \u2013 your full-year outlook? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. So thanks, Tim. Good question. I remind everybody it took us 8 years to 9 years to get Ultimate Team where it is today. Our first year of Ultimate Team was $8 million for FIFA. I think there's a huge possibility for the extra content live service event-driven model in non-sports games, but we're also very conscious that it will take time to develop. We have a relatively small amount of that built into this year's forecast. I think if it's successful, we'll start to see the benefits at the tail-end of this year and really see the benefits next year. But it's hard for us to really predict at this time exactly how that might play out. Our biggest focus, though, to remember is we want to just engage all of our users, all of our players deeply in the game and provide them more ongoing activities, content, events for them to keep coming back and playing. And if that's successful, we think the economics will follow, but more to come as we release that game into the market in November. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Looking forward to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. So, Andrew and Blake, I think we talked about this topic before, but I thought I would bring it up again. Given all of the different development efforts at Motive, BioWare, DICE and Visceral, you're now in a position where it looks like you might have too much products. So does this open up the opportunity for you guys to space out some of the non-sports franchises maybe every two years or maybe even three years as opposed to every other year? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Never too much product. I think we like our regular cadence. I think we've found a good cadence obviously with Battlefield and with Star Wars Battlefront. We're trying to make sure that we're leveraging our relationship with Disney on the Star Wars property, so aligning those where possible with their theatrical release schedules. So right now, our plan is not to change our cadence schedule. Clearly, we don't yet know how the cadence of new properties like Anthem or anything coming out of Motive will be \u2013 that's still to be determined. But I think we're pretty comfortable. We believe it rates a nice top line growth that's all organic from our teams, and we're very focused on making sure that it's very profitable along the way. So we want to continue to drive both the top line and the bottom line through new IP, existing IP, new live services, and margin expansion across all of those. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, two questions. First, obviously, you're excited by the improvements in Madden's. How have you factored that into your guidance for both the upcoming quarter and maybe in the holiday season? And then second, Battlefield 1, it looks like you're pretty excited about some changes there. Can you keep monetizing the digital after the year anniversary, meaning can you still see some pretty good digital revenues in fiscal 2019 for that game? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, so we are planning for Madden to be up year over year, but I would say that it's not up dramatically; i.e., creating a risk in any way. You know, Justin, our approach to guidance. We try to be pretty rational and conservative. We think there's some upside to our guidance number there, but I wouldn't expect that it's up dramatically creating any risk. Based on what we've seen of the game and the excitement around the e-sports mode is very, very positive, and so we're looking forward to a great Madden year ahead. In terms of Battlefield 1, we've had such great engagement there that we're continuing to feed new content into that community to try to continue to drive the game. We're constantly reminded that people are still playing Battlefield 4, for example. And that's a game that was \u2013 it's almost four years old. And so to try to be able to continue to add things for people to stay engaged and to build off that economically is a big positive for us, and we see that as one of the efforts as to why we're pushing Battlefield 1. And then, as a reminder, Andrew mentioned that at Gamescom in a few weeks, we're going to introduce a new e-sports mode to Battlefield. People have used Battlefield as an e-sports product for many years outside of EA. It's a fun fast-paced game. But with 64-player, multiplayer, it's a bit hectic and chaotic for e-sports. And so you'll see some new modes coming out that will benefit a more rational e-sports approach, and pretty exciting for us for this year and really powering next year and the year after off of that title. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is Jon Lanterman on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. In the past, you guys have stated a goal of getting the percentage of GameSpot via digital download to 40% \u2013 45%. And more recently, you updated this to 50% to 60-plus percent. Last year, we saw the traditional 5% annual mix shift accelerate closer to 10%. So looking ahead, what are some of the barriers that you guys see, the main barriers in getting to that 60-plus percent of games being downloaded? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think for us, the first and most important thing to remember is we're very global. And so while there are high bandwidth speeds in the United States and in key major countries like the UK or France or Germany, that's not consistent all through Europe or Eastern Europe or Asia. And so that's probably still the biggest impediment to full-game downloads. And the second piece is while we in the U.S., and I think it's the same in Northern Europe and some parts of Europe, the cashless credit \u2013 or cashless transaction methods are fairly well-developed. I would say they're not as well developed in other places in the world. So the use of credit cards, PayPal, any type of e-pay approach has still got a long ways to go. And I would say those two things are the biggest impediments to full-game downloads. We know that the consumer, once they do a full game download, realizes how easy it is and how effective it is for managing their games. And so we don't see consumer resistance. It's really the resistance around bandwidth speed and ability to pay with a cashless method. Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then would you say a consumer who downloads a game is also more likely to do MTX and DLC and things like that? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think I would say it's probably the opposite, which is many consumers are doing, for example, Ultimate Team, but were still buying the game physically, and they're realizing how effective and easy it is to pay through a credit card method, and thus they'll transition into a full-game download. Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thanks. That's helpful. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We'll continue to do things to help the consumer to see the opportunity there and find a way to buy our products digitally. And at the same time, we'll continue to make sure that we have a strong presence in all of our retail partners because we know it will be a mixed model for a long period of time. Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks, congrats on another good quarter First on competitive gaming, I wonder if you could comment on expectations for monetization of competitions, in particular for Madden and FIFA, or whether you still view these experiences as more about driving loyalty and community. And then maybe a bigger picture question on Frostbite, which I think, Andrew, you said is powering 12 titles in development and is often highlighted as a key factor in game quality. My question is whether this version of the engine remains cutting-edge is being refreshed on an ongoing basis, or given some more frequent console platform refreshes now, should we expect a new version of Frostbite on the horizon? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Two really good questions. On e-sports, as we think about e-sports and we think about the monetization of e-sports, we think about it along some core vectors. The first vector to e-sports is you need a global community of players who are engaged in the game. If we look at FIFA and we look at Battlefield and we look at Madden, we have many tens of millions of players in each of those franchises who are continually and consistently engaged. Next, you need a competitive game structure. And what you've seen using from us over the last 12 months is a real focus on ensuring that we have a strong competitive game structure all the way from the very, very amateur leagues through to a league championship The next thing you need is a way to monetize the increased engagement that you get out of that structure that you put into place. And what you heard from me earlier was that we saw a significant uplift in FIFA Ultimate Team revenue over the past year. And we believe a strong contributor to that is the competitive gaming modes that we built into FIFA, which again was a precursor to many of the new competitive gaming modes we built into Madden this year. And so we are hopeful to see ongoing growth and monetization in and around Madden Ultimate Team as well. And then of course, once you've got these global communities engaged at a higher rate in a digital ecosystem and a competitive game structure, then that's a very compelling community when it comes to broadcast deals and sponsorship deals. And we are seeing that also accelerate at a faster rate than we had expected and are very pleasantly surprised by that. In all honesty, our focus isn't about generating huge numbers out of broadcast deals yet, it's really about increasing viewership and building a truly entertaining experience for our global audience. But we see opportunities for strong returns on those two vectors as well, broadcast and sponsorship over the coming years. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Before Andrew answers the question on Frostbite, what I'd say is, we talk about our business in general around engagement, because that's where we're focused on. But let me be really direct. You don't get 22% year-on-year growth in live services without the e-sports power that we've seen in our Ultimate Team business. And I challenge any other console player to demonstrate where they've seen revenue growth of that level driving \u2013 coming from e-sports. It is very powerful for us and it will continue to be very powerful. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On Frostbite, again, we have a very large team across a number of different locations who are constantly and continually investing and innovating in that engine in terms of visual fidelity, in terms of physics, in terms of animation, in terms of AI. Every aspect that a game team needs to develop the most innovative and creative experiences. And when you look at what we've been able to do with Real Player technology in FIFA this year, when you look at what we've been able to do with Madden visual fidelity and Madden cinematics and Longshot or story mode, when you look at the expanding dynamic worlds that we're showing in Star Wars Battlefront 2, that is really demonstrative of the level of innovation and advancement we continue to make in that engine. And at some level, because we have a dozen teams building on top of the platform and a core team feeding all of that development back into the mainline of code, that engine is actually making leaps and bounds faster than many engines would, which is one or two games working on them. And so we are very, very happy with our core strategy of moving to a single engine. We're starting to see real leverage in the engine, not just in terms of our ability to build wonderfully large and creative and entertaining new games efficiently, but because we're able to do things that are far more innovative than things we're seeing anywhere else in the industry. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So you have a very large installed base, it seems for FIFA Mobile. Can you comment on the monetization trends that you're seeing? I think you mentioned, Blake, that June was your best month thus far. What changes have been made to drive the improved performance? And maybe comment on how it's performing relative to Madden NFL Mobile? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So a great question. Again, when we launched FIFA, we were using the blueprint that we had used and developed over a three-year period for Madden NFL and Mobile that had really started to gain traction and continues to be a very engaging property for us. And when we did launch that, we said that even though we're using the blueprint for Madden, we expect that given the nature of the global community and the different geographic and cultural differences around both engagement and monetization in the soccer audience versus the North American-focused Madden audience that we believe there would be some tuning time required. What the team has been doing on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis since launch is really better understanding through the great deal of data that we are able to get every day from play. What cultural needs are, what engagement needs are, and ultimately, what the overall monetization needs are of each player base in each community. What we're seeing now again is the ongoing commitment to live services, events that are relevant to each of those communities around the globe, started to generate the kind of engagement and monetization growth that we would expect and continue to expect. I think that we are ahead of where we were with Madden. I don't have the exact data. We're ahead of where we were with Madden. And again, when you think about Madden as in a $50 million to $100 million range being primarily North American-focused, we continue to believe that FIFA on mobile can be substantially greater than that on a global basis. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. And, Drew, a couple of examples that just occurred during that quarter is I mentioned they had 10 major new content updates. One, for example, is called VS Attack Mode, where players compete for leader board status and can unlock or upgrade items based on the division that they're in. It's proven to be very popular with the community and highly engaging. And think about this as \u2013 when we started FIFA Ultimate Team years ago, it was really one mode. And over time, it's developed into many different modes and many ways to play with different types of players. And the journey of Madden Mobiles follows that. FIFA Mobile will follow the similar journey over time. The quarter did really well, but it's a strong \u2013 it wasn't a strong quarter for American Football, but it's a strong quarter for international soccer. And so you tend to see strength in both FIFA and NBA in that quarter, but also you're seeing just the potential as we continue to add and work with the game. It's a game unlike most mobile games, it's more like our Madden \u2013 our FIFA or Madden Ultimate Team where we've tinkered, we've played with it, and we've added to it over many years and that's how we'll continue to grow both FIFA and NBA and Madden over time, and we're pretty excited about that. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks, gentlemen, for taking my call. I just have two higher-level questions. The first one is Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and a couple other games were added recently to EA Access. It feels a little bit like they're added a little bit earlier. Could you talk a little bit about this strategy around EA Access and potentially eventually an over-the-top gaming service? And then, secondly, and shifting gears on Frostbite. As that becomes more and more powerful, do you see opportunities beyond to use that game engine beyond traditional gaming? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Two great questions. As we think about subscription and less about the timing of adding of those particular titles to our EA Access subscription. But as we think about meaty consumption over the last five years, the greatest disruptor has been the combination of streaming and subscription. It's changed the way we watch television. It's changed the way we listen to music. It's changed how we think about ownership versus access. And we believe that ultimately, the combination of streaming plus subscription will also be a great disruptor to our business. And you've seen us investing there for a number of years. It's some years ago that we started our first streaming test. We continue those tests. We continue to work with other key large-scale partners on how we think streaming might work for our business in the future. You saw us launch EA Access and Origin Access. You should expect us to continue to push in growing the opportunities in and around subscription and delivering more value for our players on both of those vectors. As it relates to Frostbite, again, we had this wonderfully powerful engine that can do things that no other engine can do. And as you might imagine, in our strategic planning meetings, often we are sitting down and saying, okay, we have a great many strength as a company, whether that's nearly half people in our network, whether that's our social reach, whether that's the depth and breadth of our portfolio, whether that's our engine, or our core digital platform with IT, infrastructure, security, data, scalability. And we're always looking at how we might apply those to adjacent businesses or other areas that might deliver value both to our payers and to our shareholders. And Frostbite absolutely is front and center in those conversations. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And just one clarification. We've announced that we will release Titanfall and Battlefield 1 in September. And that's about the normal cadence. We're typically somewhere between seven months and nine months after initial putting the title out. And so those really aren't any earlier than what we would normally see. But what we do see is the more titles we have, the greater interest there is in the subscription, I think that makes commonsense. But more exciting titles like a Titanfall or Battlefield 1, it also drives a huge amount of interest in the subscription service, and we tend to see nice pops around those announcements. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious with \u2013 will keep on the FIFA theme, you're now about 11 months away from the 2018 World Cup. How are you thinking about live services as you sort of get the lead up to that event with \u2013 you've got qualifying events, you've got the actual event itself. How you can sort of parlay that to sort of a side-by-side type of situation? And then secondly for Blake, so it looks like on your operating expense number guidance for 2Q, it looks like the non-GAAP, if we're allowed to say non-GAAP, number looks to be about $575 million. Should that be the peak of the year for operating expenses? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Why don't I get that one first, and I'll let Andrew get the FIFA one. It's a very nice way of trying to have me give you third quarter and fourth quarter guidance early. But I can't say that other than to say that if you've been using historical patterns for marketing spend, you should start to think about those differently over time. Because, as we said, as we live in a live service world and as we have a bigger and bigger mobile business, we're driving and managing our business daily, not by title specifically or title launch specifically. And so what you're going to see is our marketing spend smooth out more across the year, but still be dominated by Q2 and Q3 because that's when our biggest properties come out. But we started spending on FIFA months ago or on Madden months ago. We're starting spending on Star Wars, for example, that doesn't come out until November versus the old model where the bulk of your spending came three weeks before you or four weeks before you shift the product, more like a movie. And we're moving to a much more ROI driven marketing structure where when we see something that works, we continue to fuel it and we're driving more and more of our marketing in non-traditional ways away from traditional media and into the more influencers of the world to try to drive the message home. And because of that, you're going to see different patterns in marketing spend, but I reiterate to everybody, our total marketing budget for the full year has not changed and the targets that we've talked about relative to marketing have not changed. It's simply the spend patterns are slightly higher in this quarter than they have been historically, and that's probably why most people's models were off. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On World Cup, again, as you can imagine, there's always a great deal of excitement around the World Cup. It's the world's largest sporting event and typically represents a great opportunity for us and our FIFA player community. We've got a long history of bringing that event to life for our fan base, dating all the way back to World Cup 1998, so no new announcement on that yet. But as the event gets closer in 2018, we'll be able to detail a lot more of how we're thinking about bringing the event to life for the global FIFA community. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for touching on \u2013 giving some more color on sales and marketing for next quarter, but I was wondering. Can you tease out what you mentioned earlier on the step-up in OpEx, maybe on the R&D side with the new genres? And perhaps how much of the increase is more a timing issue versus the higher run rate for R&D? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So we will have a slightly higher run rate for R&D. We're building out a new studio in Montreal, as we've told everyone. And we've hired over 100 people into that studio that are brand new to EA. This is to build the new IP around Jade Raymond's team that she has been building. I was in that studio last month and it's a wonderful new addition to our team. And we brought our BioWare Montreal team into that same facility, so they now all sit in one new studio together. We're obviously investing in Anthem, which everyone got a chance to see at E3. That's out of the BioWare Edmonton team, and they're very excited. We'll see some increases around that in terms of spending. And then we're continuing to invest across all of our network and platform activities. I don't see any of those going beyond the targets that we've talked about, trying to keep R&D expense in the 21% to 22% of revenue range. But the goal is to drive new revenue. And if for some reason we weren't able to drive new revenue, clearly that would be overspending, but we're very confident that we can drive new revenue around the action genre and continuing live service build-out across all of our products. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one I guess on Battlefront II. Obviously, you guys have done a lot of work with the first version. I think, Andrew, you said that maybe YouTube videos was up over the original. But do you have any specific data at this point that would suggest that this game could outsell Battlefront 1? And then just to confirm, I think you've said before you're looking for 14 million units within your guidance. I don't know if that's correct or not, but any thoughts there would be helpful. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Hey, Mike, just I'll let Andrew answer, but you broke in and out a little bit on the last. I think were you saying, are you changing your 14 million unit number for guidance? Is that what you asked? Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: No. I wasn't getting there yet. I may have gotten there, but I just wanted to clarify that was the number, Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes, that was and still is the number, but I'll let Andrew talk a little bit about the demand generation and how the products are shaping up. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Mike. If anyone got to see the title in around EA PLAY, or at E3 in Sony's booth, the title is coming together really, really strong. The sentiment is really strong. The single-player campaign is resonating really, really well with the community as well as the depth and breadth expansion in multi-player. The video of user up significantly, as I talked about in the prepared notes. We have not changed our unit expectation on that at this point, but we're very, very happy with the progress in the game and very energized by the positive feedback we're receiving from the community. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And Disney has been a great partner for us. They had our lead protagonist on the stage with characters from the Star Wars movie at their D23 celebration last month, and we're very excited about continuing to leverage the upcoming movie as well as the buzz that is generated around Star Wars, and so more to come. I think we're trying to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves on unit forecasts. And as I said earlier, it's still really early in the year. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Fair enough, thank you. Just one quick one, another one for me. I was hopeful you could sort of walk us through maybe the competitive setup this holiday. Obviously, not a holiday release but Destiny is coming out fairly soon in September, and then you have Call of Duty. That's a boots on the ground similar to play experience you had with Battlefield 1. And you also have Battlegrounds on Xbox, which obviously is catching a lot of buzz and also is boots on the ground, so I'm curious how you think all these four titles will play out and maybe the opportunity or threat that could create for you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: You have Assassins as well, not to just throw more fuel on your fire. I guess we've got boots in space versus boots on the ground. So what we found historically, we've had many times where we've gone into quarters that looked daunting because of the competition. Think back to GTA when it came out, and what was actually found is it grows the overall market. It drives console sales. Oftentimes, many of those titles get bundled to help drive or reduce the price of a console for the consumer, and it drives excitement in the marketplace, and we like that. It benefits the consumer and it benefits us because it generates a lot of buzz around games. We've always competed against most of those titles you mentioned or all those titles you've mentioned. And so I don't think it bothers us, but it excites us, I'd say instead. And you might remember, no Red Dead that was originally in the plans for our third quarter, fourth quarter of the calendar year, so that does open up a little bit of opportunity, I think, for everybody. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi there. Can you guys hear me okay? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. Welcome to the team, Laura. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'm really excited to be here. So I guess I have three like little ones. So I'm wondering if you've seen player engagement fall on Madden as a reflection of the weakness in NFL TV ratings, or if you've seen those things to be disconnected. That's my first one. My second one is just philosophically, marketing, I would have guessed that marketing expense in your mind was more of a substitute for your license fees because, to your point, you do have soccer starting or football starting or you're going to have Star Wars released. To me, those feel like marketing \u2013 again, marketing parallels that should cut your marketing fees \u2013 expenses, so I'm wondering how do you think about license fees as a substitute for marketing or do you not think of it that way? And then I'd love on your update on VR/AR, and where you are likely stand in future games? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Why don't I have Andrew hit the first and the last question on VR and then the first question on the NFL? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So I'll start with VR and AR. Not a lot of new news on VR for us and as you see there's not a lot of new news for VR in the industry. People seem to have come to terms of the fact that VR while an unbelievably wonderful innovation for how you consume interactive entertainment and all forms of entertainment for that matter is going to take a couple of years at least to going to get to a point where it is truly a mass market consumer opportunity. We still are in the same position we were in which we have enabled core VR capability in our Frostbite engine. We have delivered a console experience in the course of delivering a mobile experience and we'll continue to push on the boundaries of what's a sports game look like inside of VR? What's first person shooter look like in VR? What's an action adventure game look like in VR? And that's really at a design level and something that will start to manifest in the marketplace in the years to come. AR I think is more interesting. I think the notion of a data overlay into your mobile console PC games are something that takes things that are important, interesting about you whether that's geo-data or whether that's game play data or friends data, that you are able to allow the game to utilize to enhance and extend your experience. I think, we're likely to see more of that sooner and certainly, our creative teams are really thinking about what kind of data would a player want to use from their real world to augment their virtual world and you should expect to see more of that from us also in the coming months and years. As it relates to Madden, again what you might also recall is while there was a lot of articles in the early part of the season around slower TV ratings around football, post-November the ratings were actually very strong and ultimately end up with one of the most exciting Super Bowls in recent history. And, again, Tom Brady who was the chief architect of that excitement is on the cover of our Madden game this year, so we're very happy to have him. In terms of engagement for us, what we actually saw was more engagement in our Madden game and more engagement in Madden Ultimate Team and so we feel very good about that. We believe we are introducing, engaging and on boarding a new and young audience to football fandom and are excited by what we're going to do this year with Madden on Frostbite with Longshot and then many developments and innovations that come with it. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And on the marketing question. We do try to offset our marketing expenses where we have royalties, so in our sports titles where we're paying a royalty, we try to leverage our partners like FIFA or the NBA or the NFL to help us market as much as possible and in some cases we do a good job of that offset, in some cases it's not fully offset. I'd say the thing to remember is in Q2, we've got FIFA, Madden, NBA, NHL and The Sims 4 all coming out on console, plus we've got \u2013 we continue to fuel all of our mobile titles during that same timeframe and PC free-to-play titles. And so just simple along, we didn't have NBA last year, we didn't have The Sims last year, so both of those are going to be additive to the marketing expense in the quarter. But also, as I mentioned earlier, we're doing a lot of long lead-time marketing for the third quarter titles like Need for Speed or Battlefront. And despite the partnerships that we have, those still take money to market or to make sure that we're spreading the word around the quality and the excitement of the games. And so, the combination of where the titles fall and how the marketing has changed over time is how you're seeing some of the differences there in OpEx. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Super helpful. Thanks guys, very much. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks. You gave the Ultimate Team population was up 11% year-on-year. I wonder if you could give us an update on the trends in terms of the number of payers and the magnitude of the payers and what the growth rates are as well there. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, without getting into too much numbers, what I can tell you is, the number of people that buy the game and then join Ultimate Team continues to go up. FIFA is the leader across all of our Ultimate Teams in that respect and we believe the story mode last year helped drive much of that growth, so more people coming into Ultimate Team from the core game and more people starting to spend money realizing that it is very fun and if they spend some money it will be even be more fun. And also the amount of dollars they spend are continuing to go up over time. As we add new ways to play and new content to play with, that gives them more things to spend money on over time. So it's a win-win across-the-board. It's more engagement, more enjoyment and more things to actually spend on which is driving the success of all of the Ultimate Teams. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Got it. And it looks like, if I did my math right, the gross margin expansion in 1Q was around 700 basis points and then in the Q2, the, I guess, sequential improvement in gross margins on a year-over-year basis was down a little bit. Is that just tied to higher royalty costs or is there something else going on that would prohibit more margin expansion? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, it's mainly tied to the fact that we have four sports titles that all have royalties to them in the quarter and as those titles continue to be successful, that's obviously impacts the gross margin particularly in the second quarter. We'll get some offset with The Sims, but not enough to offset all of it. We also tend to have fairly conservative forecasts on digital, because it's hard for us to guess exactly how fast the consumer will move to digital. So clearly, if more digital live services occur or more full-game downloads occur, there could be some upside to that gross margin number. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you very much. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: One last question. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in on the call. You guys have a big bucket of initiatives in cloud streaming, AI, virtual human. So which initiative in that bucket would most likely to be financially impactful over the next three to five years? And then overall, how much are you spending on these initiatives as you are thinking long-term about your business? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Again, there's a lot of things that we're investing in and again we've \u2013 what we talked about in our prepared notes is we do believe there's going to be more change in the next five years in our industry than there has been in the last 45 years. And we want to ensure that we're on the frontline of that transformation and disruption in our business. As we think about those things, we are very focused in our investment. We don't have hundreds and hundreds of people working on these types of projects. We are very calculated and targeted in how we invest and in terms of where we think the greatest return will come. For many of those things, we actually think the time horizon is about five years plus, but things like cloud and streaming, we believe, is probably in the two to five-year timeframe. When we think about subscription, we're already seeing return from that and the combination of that with streaming on that two to five-year time horizon could be very meaningful in terms of revenue addition for us. And so as we think about the future, we're always going to have small squads thinking about new technology and we think about it on what are we building for this fiscal year? What are we building for the next 24 months. What are we building for the next 24 months to 5 years and how are we thinking about 5 years plus. And you should expect the five years plus a very, very small targeted teams, to two to five years a slightly bigger and much of our investment is around delivering in the next 24 months. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think just two things to note is we started investing on the foundation to be able to have a streaming business or a subscription business three or four years ago, and much of our investment around cloud has gone on over the last couple of years and we feel like we're in a very good position there. So don't assume it's all going to start some time now. Much of it's already baked in. The second thing is part of the change that we've tried to drive at EA is we ask the simple question, if we're going to invest in this what are we going to stop investing in. We can't do everything. And the organization is very focused around that and very much positive when we ask that question in a way of trying to constantly reprioritize what's the most important thing to do today and we think that will also help us manage that investment, so we don't show up in the future with a big surprise. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: With that, we'll end the call. We'll talk to everyone next quarter. Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. We have changed the name of our net sales operating metric to net bookings. This came up in a recent discussion with the SEC as part of their ordinary course periodic review of our filings. We also believe that this change will enable our industry to better align on terminology. We have not changed how it is calculated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. It was a strong second quarter for Electronic Arts. Excellent launches for our EA SPORTS titles and growth in our event-driven live services across all major platforms continued our momentum for the fiscal year-to-date. Revenue and earnings were above our guidance, highlighted by continuing digital growth and strong ongoing execution to deliver for our players around the world. The impact of the digital transformation is accelerating across the interactive entertainment industry. Players today are looking for more choice, more content and more fun in experiences that continually evolve with the way they want to play. Capturing these opportunities is at the core of EA's strategy, creating extraordinary new games, content and experiences, wrapped in services, accessed through more platforms and more business models and powered by innovative technologies. These are the key growth drivers that uniquely position EA to lead this industry. EA's Q2 results reflected our focus on these growth areas. Our new EA SPORTS titles drove more downloads and deep engagement, our mobile portfolio continues to strengthen and our event-driven live services continue to deliver the experiences our players want. Beginning with EA SPORTS and Madden NFL 18, players are loving the combination of an emotional story mode, greater depth and more competition. We had 25% more players engaged in Madden Ultimate Team through Q2 year-over-year. And our competitive gaming player base has grown by over 30% in the same period. FIFA 18 launched in late September, reaching players across more than 50 countries and igniting the global soccer community. The depth and precision of the Frostbite-driven gameplay are just the beginning for FIFA 18, with much more to come as programs like Squad Battles, FUT ICONS and Ones to Watch are already driving strong FIFA Ultimate Team engagement. NBA LIVE 18 was a strong reentry into the market and continues to captivate a growing base of NBA fans. And with NHL 18, the new NHL THREES mode helped us reach an entirely new audience, with 60% more first-time EA players joining through Q2 over the previous game. This quarter was an outstanding demonstration of the ongoing opportunity for our EA SPORTS franchises to drive growth through expanded reach, new experiences and more competition. On mobile, our portfolio of deep, high quality and long-term experiences continues to strengthen in an increasingly competitive market. In Q2, Madden NFL Mobile saw unique players grow significantly year-over-year, as we kicked off a new season in the game. In-game events in Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes throughout the quarter continued to drive high levels of engagement across the community. Both of these games charted in the top 10 grossing games on the App Store and Google Play dozens of times throughout the quarter. In addition, FIFA Mobile topped 113 million players live to-date. And fans are anticipating our annual update to that game that comes in Q3. Our communities are expanding. Our players are deeply engaged, and our strategy to deliver a portfolio of mobile games that players love to spend time with is showing its strength. Across our portfolio, event-driven live services are enhancing the experience for players, keeping them together with friends, extending the fun and giving them choice in how they want to play. The global Battlefield community has tens of millions of unique players continuing to connect and play with their friends across different games in the franchise. In The Sims 4, monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year and anticipation is high for the console game launching in Q3. As these communities and many others in our top franchises continue to thrive, our subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access are bringing more players from across our network to join in. Our subscription player base continues to grow. And you should expect us to continue driving this model to more platforms going forward. We are now well-positioned for the holiday quarter. We will add the momentum with two massive new experiences, a new event-driven live service and more competition. First is Need for Speed Payback, launching on November 10. An all-new story drives this experience with a narrative, characters and explosive moments that will excite a broad audience of players. Combined with deep customization, a huge open world and a rich multiplayer experience, this is one of the biggest Need for Speed games ever created. Trailer views are up more than 100% over the previous title. And the community is excited to jump into this new Need for Speed. On November 17, Star Wars Battlefront II will launch worldwide. This is a game that is nearly three times the size of the previous Battlefront, delivering an untold Star Wars story in our single-player campaign, multiplayer battles and dozens of ships, settings and heroes from all three Star Wars eras. As you'll remember, there is no Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront II. Instead our event-driven live service will be free for all players, delivering new environments, new heroes, in-game events and more to everyone in the community. This new ecosystem as post-launch content is built around player choice and designed to keep the community together and extend the experience for many years to come. As we run the live service, we will continually work with our player community to ensure the player experience remains rich and balanced. This began with a beta in early October, where millions of players got their first taste of 20 v 20 multiplayer, enabling us to learn a great deal and make some key adjustments to balance and progression. Now our sights are set on launch and delivering a Star Wars game like none other in scale, depth and service to fans around the world. Competitive gaming will continue to grow in our portfolio in Q3, with more ways to play and watch. As you may have seen, the Madden NFL Club Championship is the first esports competition to feature a full roster of teams and players from a U.S. professional sports league. And tournaments to represent all 32 NFL teams are already underway. We have also launched a Madden Ultimate League for elite players, further expanding the Madden NFL competitive footprint for players, sponsors and broadcasters. On the FIFA side, we just announced the EA SPORTS FIFA Global Series that kicks off in November, our landmark ecosystem of online tournaments, official league competitions, and an all-star event on the road to the FIFA eWorld Cup 2018. And this spring, we will kick off competitions in our third major franchise with Battlefield 1 Incursions, a bespoke competitive gaming environment designed in partnership with our community. We're excited for the holiday quarter and to continue a strong year of innovation and leadership for our players and for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. We're pleased with the performance of our business through the second quarter, which added strong digital growth to the dependable results we expect from our sports titles. In particular, we saw a notable shift to digital purchases in our sports titles, and strong growth in our Ultimate Team of event-driven live services. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $959 million compared to $898 million a year ago and above our guidance by $4 million. Operating expenses were $611 million, $27 million lower than our guidance, driven by the phasing of our marketing investment. GAAP operating loss was $41 million compared to an operating loss of $49 million a year ago and resulted in a loss per share of $0.07, $0.11 better than our guidance. Note that given our GAAP share results were a loss, our share count was 309 million shares. Had we reported a profit, the diluted share count would have been 312 million shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $52 million, down $70 million from last year. The decrease was driven by timing of collections. In contrast, operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.082 billion, our strongest ever performance measured at the end of a second quarter, and $479 million above last year's. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $22 million. Remember that the FASB rules associated regarding the treatment of stock-based comp have changed and this affects how we classify our cash flow. However, all these comparisons are made on a like-for-like basis. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $153 million, leaving $928 million in our two-year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.4 billion, with 35% of this balance held onshore. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.179 billion, up $81 million on the prior year and $19 million above our guidance. Exchange rates have improved over the last 12 months, but this tailwind is offset by the effect of our hedging program, resulting in a net FX headwind of $10 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Performance over guidance was primarily driven by our mobile live services, The Sims 4 and by Ultimate Team. Digital net bookings were $579 million, up 19% on the year ago period and a new record for the second quarter. The main drivers of the increase were Battlefield 1, Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18 full game downloads. Digital net bookings now represent 63% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to 57% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 22% year-on-year to $310 million. This increase was driven by strong growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team and in Battlefield 1, FIFA Online 3 in Asia and The Sims 4. In addition, our EA Access and Origin Access services continue to see rapid growth. Mobile delivered net bookings of $150 million, up 9% year-on-year. This was a Q2 record and also drove the trailing 12-month net bookings to a new high. Growth was primarily from Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Madden Mobile. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $119 million, 28% higher than last year, driven by Madden NFL and Battlefield 1. 36% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 30% a year ago. FIFA 18 launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first three weeks of sales, it was about 25% digital, up from 16% in the comparable period to FIFA 17. The digital portion of Madden sales also increased 9 percentage points year-on-year to 34%. Turning to guidance. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remains $5.075 billion. However, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.63. We're raising our operating cash flow guidance from $1.575 billion to $1.6 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.48 billion. Although our expectations for net revenue are unchanged, we are raising our guidance for net bookings from $5.1 billion to $5.15 billion, driven by the strength in Ultimate Team. The difference between GAAP net revenue and net bookings guidance is driven by revenue deferrals. For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.135 billion, cost of revenue to be $521 million and operating expenses to be $690 million. OpEx is up year-on-year primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in existing and new live services. This results in a loss per share of $0.21 for the third quarter. Note that this is calculated using the basic share count of 309 million. Should we report a profit, the diluted share count of 313 million will be used. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $2 billion. This is down 3% year-on-year with growth in live services offset by the effect of different product launches. Looking further ahead, our growth priorities continue to be the expansion of our live services, including the integration of our esports business across many other titles, the addition of new genres such as action, new business models like our subscription business and to continue to deliver profitable growth in our mobile business. The core of our fiscal 2019 is in a full slate of sports titles and their associated live services, plus new live services from Star Wars Battlefront II. We will add the next Battlefield game and moved into the action genre with Anthem. We expect our subscriber base to continue to grow and our new mobile titles to benefit from players looking for deeper experiences with higher production values. As you start to build your fiscal 2019 models, remember that our event-driven live services continue to be the bedrock of our business. Live services, including mobile live services, were nearly half of our next bookings over the last 12 months. Including our recurring sports titles and catalog sales in the calculation takes us to a total of over 75% of our annual net bookings, leaving less than a quarter of net bookings delivered through the sale of our remaining frontline titles. In addition, our live services are growing strongly. We forecast 10% to 15% growth in fiscal 2018 and we're tracking well ahead of that. We're excited by the progress we're making and the impact it will have on fiscal 2019, particularly given the success we are already seeing in esports driving Ultimate Team revenues and next year's FIFA World Cup in Russia, which is sure to drive interest in soccer around the globe. In conclusion, our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance. In addition, this quarter demonstrates how they can also drive the digital transformation within our business, both with regards to downloads and to highly enjoyable event-driven live services. As such, they offer a window into how all our games will evolve over the months and years to come. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. Today we reach a global connected community of more than 350 million players worldwide. In the future, we envision a global network that engages more than 1 billion people in play. Our path to achieve this is clear, continue to deliver amazing games and content across more platforms, offer dynamic services that enhance the experience, engage a global audience through competition and more content and drive disruptive new opportunities to expand how the world plays and watches games. In each of these growth vectors, EA is uniquely positioned with the talented teams, creativity and technology to lead our industry. Creating groundbreaking experiences for our players across more platforms and more geographies continues to be at our core. From visually stunning, deeply immersive games like Star Wars Battlefront II and our next Battlefield to ongoing innovation in our EA SPORTS titles, we're advancing the state of the art. We will continue to expand our mobile portfolio with more high quality experiences and games that can reach a larger audience of players around the world. We're also producing experiences that will blur the lines of how our people play, like our shared-world action titled Anthem, and our new IP in development at Motive. Through this growing portfolio of games that push the boundaries forward, we are positioned to offer some of the most captivating experiences in all of entertainment. Surrounding these games are services that power the choice, connection and community that our players seek. Event-driven live service like Ultimate Team, Star Wars Battlefront II seasons and our EA SPORTS mobile titles continue to enhance and expand our games for many years of play. Our global communities for The Sims and other franchises thrive on the connections, interactions and creations shared between players. And for players seeking new community and the next great experience, our subscription services will continue to expand and remove friction in a crowded digital world. Competitive gaming and esports then introduce more opportunities for the world to engage with our games and content. Today, our Madden NFL and FIFA tournaments are elevating competitive sports gaming to the world stage with the energy and drama of high-stakes competition. Next, official competitions will ignite our Battlefield community. Competitive gaming will integrate into more of our expenses and more of our franchises in the future, continuing our focus to make stars of all our players and expanding our ecosystem of content to engage the massive esports audience. We're also building for the future, continuing to invest in our technology platform, our Frostbite engine and our Player Network to deliver this growing collection of content wrapped in services. Our labs and central technology teams are also exploring disruptive new concepts to advance the way we play, including super games, the notion of a metaverse and how the cloud can deliver dynamic experiences to players on every platform. At EA, we believe that entertainment is a fundamental human need. We also believe that games, by their ability to drive social connection, self-actualization and competition, are the single best form of entertainment. With amazing games that reach across more platforms, more geographies and more business models, with live services that provide many years of fun, with competitions that engage a global audience, and disruptive innovations that will continue to evolve the way we play, we believe EA is well positioned to be the entertainment platform of the future. Now Blake and I will take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Christopher D. Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right, great. Thank you. I just had a couple. So for digital downloads, I think you called out year-on-year changes for FIFA and Madden in excess of 5 points year-on-year, which I think has been a long-term guidance for mix shift in console revenue. Do you feel like we're reaching any sort of inflection in digital downloads? And is 5 points per year still the right way to think about that shift over time? And then just secondly, for Star Wars Battlefront, I was hoping if you can maybe talk a little bit more about how the beta went? What type of feedback you got from the community during that process? And maybe any changes that you've made to the in-game monetization mechanics since the beta? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Hey, Chris, this is Blake. I'll address the digital download piece, then I'll have Andrew do the Star Wars piece. We were very pleased and a bit surprised at the strength of digital downloads, both for FIFA and Madden. FIFA, in particular, since it's such a global game and sold in many markets where digital is not as strong as it is in some of the more mature markets. So it's great to see the movement towards digital. And we attribute that to some digital-only promotions that we did, some special digital packages, as well as the continued involvement of everyone with Ultimate Team, which is 100% digital, and I think that's driving the adoption. Overall, we're continuing to see the 5% number look conservative. It did last year. And it's on track to look conservative again this year. So to us, that signals that we're certainly not slowing in digital. And we might be meeting a inflection point where our consumers are starting to just pick up that pace. So we're very optimistic about where it's going. You clearly can see that in the gross margin differences as you look at our business year-over-year. And we'll continue to do everything we can to push the digital business. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So Star Wars Battlefront II, feedback from the beta and the added assets that we've put in the marketplace have been very strong. Feedback on gameplay was very positive. The beta was very robust and probably one of the most stable betas that we've had. And again, the core reason why we put betas into the marketplace is really to test the robustness of the infrastructure and systems on which a game of this size and magnitude will run on. As we've looked at the feedback on the graphical quality, the overall gameplay and assets around single player that we've launched since then, everything is very, very positive. There was of course the conversation around loot boxes, which is not a Star Wars Battlefront II specific conversation, but more one that the industry is having with players across the global community. And we are engaged in that conversation, engaging with our players on a daily basis as we think about that. There's really two conversations going on there. One is about value. And in a world where a player pays $60 for a game, will there also be value in the ongoing digital ecosystem that comes for many years? When we think about value, we look at Star Wars Battlefront II and we say, we start with a game that's nearly three times the size of the last game. We take what much of the content that would've been gated behind a Season Pass, and we offer that to the community for free. So we feel very good about the overall value proposition focused on keeping the player community together. Then as we think about players that are playing the game for many years post-launch and the digital ecosystem and the event-driven live services that they participate in, it comes down to the second conversation, which is, does the digital ecosystem offer the opportunity for an individual player in the community to pay to win? And balance and fairness inside of gameplay is very important to our community. And it's very important to us. And it's kind of a benchmark by which DICE builds games. And we have seen that in the many DICE games, multi-player games we've built over the years. When we think about this, it really comes down to what are the things that you can earn, what are the things that you can buy, and how do we manage progression through that process? And while we will be making adjustments based on feedback from the beta, which is great, and we'll continue a daily dialogue with our players to make ongoing adjustments for many years to come, as this event-driven live service continues, we feel very good about the fact that you can earn almost everything in the game. And more importantly, key elements that drive progression can only be earned in the game. But there will be an opportunity for players who come in to also enhance and extend their experience through the ongoing digital economy. And we believe that what we've got with a core base game that's three times the size, what would have previously been gated behind Season Pass is now free for all users, with a focus on keeping a community together, and an event-driven live service that we expect will continue for many years to come that is built around player choice and focuses around a world where players can earn everything they need to progress through the game, is the right way to balance this. And so we feel very good about that. And we'll stay connected with our community as we move through the coming weeks, months and years. Christopher D. Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Appreciate the commentary around the number of Ultimate Team players in Madden. I was curious as to hear about increases in payer penetration across FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden, and kind of what has worked to kind of bring on more players that start paying. And what do you think are the biggest hurdles or points of friction you still need to overcome? And secondly, just any comments or kind of like commentary on what went on around Visceral Games? And the state of the live action creation portfolio right now? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: All right. This is Blake, again. I'll start on the Ultimate Team one, and then Andrew can address Visceral. Ultimate Team, the number one driver continues to be bringing more people into the base game. And we believe the single player added to Madden this year as well as the single player last year and this year in FIFA were big drivers in bringing people in and introducing them to how to play the game as well as how to play Ultimate Team. And we found the flow of people starting to play Ultimate Team has continued to grow and then people who realize that spending some money in Ultimate Team is actually a lot of fun, and that continued to grow. And overall, that's been across all of the Ultimate Team sports but it's been most prevalent in both FIFA and Madden. I think the other thing to remember is we're getting better and better each year at the live events that we design and run, and those events are more and more fun and bring in more people. And that, plus the fact that we build all of our esports around Ultimate Team has allowed us to continue to drive the business, as everyone who is interested in esports and playing in an esports tournament, either online or in person, has to practice as well and build their Ultimate Team for the esports business and that's what helped drive it as well. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on Visceral, again, anytime you close a studio, it's a very, very tough decision and something that we take very seriously and we spend a lot of time working through before we make such a decision. But it does happen from time to time as part of the creative process. And during the development process of the game that they were working on, we've been testing the game content with players, listening to their feedback in terms of what and how they wanted to play and really tracking that closely with fundamental shifts in the marketplace and we are seeing an evolution in the marketplace. And it became clear to us that to deliver the experience that players wanted to come back and enjoy for a long time, that we needed to pivot the design. You may have heard the conversation around single player versus multiplayer or single player versus live service and this wasn't about that conversation. It wasn't about this was just a single-player game or it needed to be a live service, it was more about how do we get to a point where the overall gameplay experience was right for players. We still believe strongly in a Star Wars IP, Star Wars Battlefront II as you will have heard we're very excited about. We're also very happy with some of the assets and content that was created as part of that game development and we'll be looking at how we can better utilize that in line with fan and player expectations in the future. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. So, I think Blake, you previously talked about the cross-currents in your mobile business and how your older games like The Simpsons are no longer really growing as rapidly but the newer games like Galaxy of Heroes are. So can you talk about where we are in terms of that mix shift between old and new? It seems like your mobile revenue growth has accelerated for the second quarter in a row, which makes me think that the older games must now be less than 50% of the total and shrinking in terms of the overall contribution. And also Andrew, can you update us on what the plans are for the launch of the new mobile version of The Sims? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, so I'll talk about the first part and then I'll let Andrew get the The Sims piece. Clearly, The Sims is an exciting addition to the mobile business and for us and we'll see that some time in the coming spring. We also have some unannounced titles that we're working on and so you'll see those. I think all of those will help drive the growth over the next few years, if not longer. A couple of things, I mean, yes the drag from some of the older titles have slowed, but the reality is some of those titles have just stayed around for a long time because they still do great business for us. The key to our mobile business, and I think different than some other people in the industry is, we drive our business just like our console and PC business to be profitable. So we hold up high standards on profitability. We invest around marketing expenses, around a profitable model, so we don't simply try to build the mobile business in an unprofitable way like we've seen some of the people do in this market. And that's something that's not going to change. And we're not going to try to drive top line growth simply with zero profitability. That doesn't do anything for the shareholders. And so you'll see us continue to have steady growth. We've got great products coming down the path in the future. We're very excited about The Sims. I'll let Andrew talk about that. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So The Sims is going really well. It is still in soft launch and we're receiving valuable feedback on the game and incorporating adjustments both in terms of kind of a core engagement profile in the game as well as how the game monetizes over time. The Sims are a very valuable brand for us, and a very variable IP. And it's a genre in which we are essentially unchallenged on any platform for that matter. And so, we want to make sure that we get it right with our community and we're seeing very strong uptick in the kind of metrics that we need, and we expect to launch it in the spring. And the good news for us, given the strength of The Sims brand, we still have The Sims FreePlay which is doing really well for us on mobile. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And just since we're on The Sims, I'll just throw in one more, is that as you can see or hear from the prepared text, we mentioned The Sims a couple of times, The Sims 4 as a major driver in the growth in the quarter. We're continue to be very pleased with how The Sims 4 and all the extra content has performed and we're very excited about the Sims 4 console version that will be out later this quarter. And I think that bodes well for the overall Sims franchise both in console, PC, or all, console, PC and mobile. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on mobile. The acceleration and the pickup in mobile revenues that you saw this quarter, it's a nice positive and glad to see that that's driven by in-app purchases. Have you guys considered the potential for mobile advertising in any of your games whether it is The Sims or other sports titles? And then, if that is a meaningful contributor to your business today, could you help us quantify or think about that opportunity going forward? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then the second question is for Blake on guidance. It sounds like with the sports full game downloads doing much better and the mobile business accelerating, then as you guys said, live services is certainly tracking ahead of your outlook, you should really see some strong digital revenue mix benefiting margins going forward, and I'm not sure that that is really as apparent in the guidance. So it makes sense that Star Wars is a gross margin headwind for next quarter, but is there anything specific or unique about fiscal 3Q this year that's going to drive any sort of op margin deleverage that we should keep in mind? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Okay, so first on mobile. We've been doing advertising in some of our mobile games for a long time, many years. And that total advertising number is under $100 million. It is a good business. We operate on a simple principle, which we will not do other mobile game advertising outside of our own games. That is different than what other companies do. Our goal is to keep people inside our network of mobile games. And so if we're going to do mobile game advertising, we would do that simply to steer people to other games inside our network, and that's not going to be advertising dollars for us. It just minimizes our outside marketing costs. But we do do some mobile games. We have some games that we don't do advertising in, and we're continuing to look at opportunities to grow that. But the biggest challenge is most people play mobile games anonymously and anonymous advertising is at very low CPMs versus very structured advertising that you might see out of a Google or a Facebook, where they have strong intent information on the consumer. There maybe some data that we can build that. We're thinking about it in a lot of ways. But right now it's still at a fairly base level. On the guidance, a couple of things to just look at. One is I encourage people to go back and look over the last five years. I think coming out of Q2, we've always been fairly conservative on our guidance going into our largest quarter of the year, Q3. And I don't think we've had any different behavior in how we've given guidance over those last periods of time. And so I don't think there's any messaging whatsoever. I think raising our guidance by $0.10 on the bottom line is a pretty powerful raise and $50 million on the top line. And I think it's consistent with how we've operated historically and signals the positive view we have on the back half of the year. And the split between Q2 and Q3, I challenge you guys on the phone to start doing your models a little more finely and listening to us a little closer on what we tell people. We phase our revenue for you every quarter, and I think we're getting much more \u2013 we have a much better ability to predict our revenue because of the large component of live services. And so we're probably going to be better at our guidance over time. So I'd just keep that challenge there to you. Next question. Operator : Your next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. First, for Blake. Q3, can you go through the puts and takes on the 3% decline in revenues? I know you had two big titles last year, one big one and one maybe medium one this year. Talk about maybe your expectations for Battlefront versus Battlefield. And then Andrew, World Cup is obviously next year. You've launch FIFA. Are you thinking about that as a live services event? And how will you capture incremental users and maybe dollars around the World Cup? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, Justin. I think most people know that Battlefront, or excuse me, Battlefield 1 last year was a smash success for us and we had a huge Q3 because of that. We also had Titanfall, which while it didn't meet our original expectation, still sold very well. And so with Star Wars Battlefront II and Need for Speed and Sims 4 console, you just can't comp against the strength of Battlefield 1 last year. It's obviously a big quarter for us. Guiding net bookings to $2 billion is huge and the fact that it's only down 3% year-on-year with the strength of Battlefield 1 last year, I think is a huge positive. And live services obviously continue to grow. We're seeing strength across the board there. But we still have some unknowns. We don't yet know how the Battlefront II live service will monetize. We'll find that out over the next quarter. We'll be able to give people a better sense of that in Q4 or Q3 when we talk. But that's part of the unknown. And The Sims 4 on console, while people are very excited about it, we'll just need to see how well that sells. So those are probably the unknowns in the mix versus last year as well as the scale differences. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: On World Cup, we don't have any news to announce right now, but EA SPORTS, we have a long tradition of celebrating the World Cup and bringing it to life for fans, stretching back to really the World Cup 1998. So as it gets closer, the world's largest sporting event, we'll announce more details on how we'll continue this tradition. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question, maybe two. One, going back to the digital commentary from before, I wanted to understand, normally in the December quarter, you see a little bit of a mix shift back sometimes to packaged goods with gifting around the holidays. Do you think we've seen the type of tipping point where digital penetration might power through some of the seasonality we've seen around packaged goods over the last couple years? That's number one. And then number two, just coming back to the mobile business, I want to understand a little bit of the mix of how you think about allocating marketing dollars there between user growth versus driving more in-game monetization, just to understand a little bit how you frame ROI on the marketing spend in the mobile business? Thanks guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So Eric, I'll address the packaged mix and then Andrew can address the mobile piece. So on packaged mix, obviously Christmas or the holidays is always going to skew towards more physical. People want to have a gift to give someone. But we do know that while Star Wars Battlefront I skewed more heavily than we typically see, we think Battlefront II may not skew quite as much, because the breadth of the game. It addresses some of the interests that the hardcore players wanted. It's got more. It's got space battles. Many of the things that the hardcore and the traditional first-person shooter audience played were not as strong in the first Battlefront, where this there's more of it. So we might see a skew that helps bring that up a little bit, but we don't know for certain yet. We do know there were a lot of people that were both hardcore and the younger audience playing in the beta, so our sense is that we could see a slight skew. We haven't assumed a big number, skew difference in our guidance, but our hope is, is that could ultimately help the margins a little bit in the quarter. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So in terms of mobile marketing, we've got a very finely tuned model that the teams are constantly updating to ensure, as Blake talked about earlier, we maintain the level of profitability that we believe is appropriate for our mobile business and continue to drive that business profitably. And so when we think about it, most of our programmatic digital spending is around acquisition. But that's done with a profitability metric in mind, and done in a world where we're trying to attract the right cohort of people who ultimately will monetize and drive ongoing profitability. We work on a more conservative approach than some people in the marketplace do. Our lifetime value model operates over a shorter time span than some people in the marketplace. And we do that simply because we believe it's better balanced to drive short-term, medium-term and long-term profitable growth of our overall portfolio of titles. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think the other thing to remember is we're trying to build a mobile game that has deep and long engagement. If you look at Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, we know that people play for a long time and they play almost every day. And it's driven by the events that we put into the game every few weeks. That's the key to the game model versus a model in which you have to feed the beast all the time with new people to keep the core users engaged. These are games that are really built around a much more engaging loop that people could play over a long period of time. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. I had two questions. First, Blake, I hate to pin you down, but would you be willing to share how many units you're assuming for Star Wars Battlefront II in fiscal 2018? Is that still 14 million, I think, was the previous number? And then second... Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Go ahead. Sorry. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: No, go ahead. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I was just going to say, let me try to answer it. And then I'll let you say or ask your next question and even a third question, if you want. So we're giving guidance on units once a year at the start of the year to help people size things. We're finding units are becoming less and less meaningful to us, because obviously there's a difference between a digital unit and a physical unit. Obviously, we've been surprised on the growth of digital units. And it's all about the live service at the end of the day as well. And so assume that any change in our unit guidance for any game, including Battlefront II, is built into our annual or quarterly guidance changes that we've put in place. And so focus on the revenue guidance and not unit guidance. So now let me let you ask your next question. And I'll stay quiet until I hear it. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Sounds good. So you've had a lot of success with digital add-on content. But there are other areas that could have a significant impact on the business in the coming years, like continued growth of full-game download mix, subscription, streaming games from the cloud. Which of those opportunities are long-term drivers that you're most focused on? Or maybe there's some others I didn't mention. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I would say all of the above. Clearly, all of those are important to us. We're actively working on the extra content piece. You can see that in the numbers that we've put up over the last few years. And where, as Andrew talked about in the call and in his question-and-answer component around Star Wars, we spent a lot of time trying to build out a live service model for Star Wars Battlefront. And we'll see how that plays out. And you can imagine we're thinking and working on live service models on many of our other games. It's critical, because that's how the consumer wants to play the games. And that's why we're driving them that way. Subscription obviously is very important to us. We've been doing a lot of work on Origin Access and EA Access. And as Andrew mentioned, you'll most likely see those on other platforms. And you'll most likely see additional content coming into those subscriptions and some exciting things to come there. But we believe that's a very important way for more consumers to enjoy more games over time at a very reasonable price. And then streaming, ultimately there's a lot of opportunity there. It may be a few years down the road still. But that, plus things like subscription or live services, go together very well. And you can imagine that we are spending a great amount of time, both in our technology world and in our games development on how games would operate in that kind of an environment. So more to come on all that. But I think all of those together, plus the base business that we have today, bodes extremely well for our business and the industry in general. But we're very focused on how do we evolve this model over time to be as profitable as possible and as consistent and repeatable as possible. We think that's what investors want. And we think that delivers the best game services to the consumer. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And one addition there as we think about long-term drivers, just a little extra context as we think about this. You may have heard me say before, one of the greatest disruptions in the consumption of entertainment media in the last five years has been the combination of streaming plus subscription, and that we are thinking very seriously about that. You're seeing us do work in subscription and you've heard us talk about the work that we're doing at a technology level around the infrastructure and services that we would need to facilitate a subscription around games. And the one thing that's often lost when we have this conversation is that unlike linear media, the subscription fee paid is not the total value of what a player might expend as they enjoy the games they play inside of subscription. Because of our live service offerings, the subscription really is about onboarding a large community globally of committed, connected players, who not only play the games in the subscription, but also participate in the live services. And so we believe long term, while it may take us some years to facilitate that at the kind of scale that we expect it to evolve to, in the same way that digital music and digital movies have evolved, the upside for the interactive entertainment industry is uncapped by virtue of the value of live services that are born inside of a subscription. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks a lot. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So looking at FIFA Mobile, 113 million users, a very big number. Just wondering if you could talk where that game stands today in terms of monetization? And what's the timeline going forward for when it could become a real contributor? And I think on console, FIFA's roughly triple the size of Madden. Would that conceivably hold true on mobile as well? And then can you just discuss \u2013 second, can you discuss the launch plan to support Battlefront II? Just wondering what we should expect in terms of marketing? Whether you should get any boost from around the movie marketing? And then whether there's any plan to discount the game to drive unit sales. And then finally, just a quick one for Blake, it's a follow-up to Mike's question, just wondering if you would share how much Battlefront live services revenue is embedded in guidance? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Okay. There was a lot there. Let me try and start. So FIFA Mobile, you started with 113 million users, how do we think about that with respect to Madden. What you heard from us in the prepared remarks is that Madden NFL, in its third season, continues to go from strength to strength. The reality is, is that we had had a couple of false starts on Madden even before the first season in the current iteration of that franchise on mobile. But in its current iteration, it's spent a great deal of time in the top 10 through Q2, and I think was number one on a number of days also. So very, very strong. And we're really starting to understand how to truly support and entertain a community of Madden players on mobile. FIFA, in a few weeks will launch, again on mobile, for its second season. And you might remember that when we launched FIFA last year, we knew that even though it followed a similar mechanic and a similar design construct to Madden, that given the global community and the nuances that exist around football or soccer globally, that we believe it was going to take sometime to tune. This is a long-term play for us. Football or soccer is the biggest sport in the world. Mobile has more players than any other platform in the world. And we believe that this is truly a global opportunity and as we think about this in the West and the East, we are committed to this for the long term. We expect that we will see monetization grow in the coming year, but even if it took us three seasons in the same way it has with Madden, that would still become completely fine for us, because we are growing it profitably and soccer is not getting any less popular on a global basis. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And I think to the point on triple the size, I'm not going to give you a forecast there. But what I would say is soccer is truly a global game and growing in places like China, where we may never have a console market and where PC free-to-play is not growing as fast as it once was, but mobile is continuing to grow very fast. So there's a scenario that says FIFA on mobile could be much larger than 3x Madden. And our hope is that between current FIFA on console, current FIFA on the online market in Korea, Japan and China and Southeast Asia plus mobile would be a huge market for us. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So in terms of movie marketing around Battlefront II, and do we hope to get a benefit from that, the answer is absolutely yes. That's part of the reason why we do a license to a great IP like Star Wars. What you may have noticed is that Disney have just released the first major trailer for The Last Jedi. It had really, really strong and positive feedback. They are marketing this title on a more compressed timeline. And we're seeing the anticipation build for the movie in the same way we're seeing anticipation build for the game. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And on discounting, let me just make it really clear right now so all you guys don't have anything to write about on Black Friday. We bring the game out right before Black Friday so you will most likely not have discounts at Black Friday that we pay for. That doesn't mean that you might not see some stores choose to discount games on Black Friday out of their own pocket. We will most likely discount the game like we did last time around the movie launch, and maybe you'll even see some selective discounts around the holidays, either Thanksgiving or Christmas. That's the way the games business always has worked. And so if you see the title on discount, don't read anything into that other than the fact that that's the way you sell games in the holidays. In terms of the live service, I can't break out the actual forecast, but I would say it's not large for Battlefront II. Partially in the quarter, because we'll just get it going in the quarter and it will really start to drive the live events coming out of the quarter into the fourth quarter. So we really won't have a good sense of how well it's doing or how large it can be until probably at the tail end of the third quarter and really the tail end of the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you going. But it's not in a position that it's a large component of the fiscal forecast or the quarter forecast. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, there. Can you hear me okay? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Super. So you guys have had FIFA for about two decades and I'm curious about historically when the U.S. has not been in the World Cup, what the impact is on your game sales, player engagement lengths. And then secondly, your marketing was well lower than we expected. And I'm wondering, could you give us update? Is that a timing shift, or should we be taking our marketing spending down next quarter as well? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: The marketing piece, it's all timing shift. I think we talked about in last quarter. We're doing marketing, a broader marketing and different types of marketing all during the year. And so it's less concentrated around launch time. I think overall, we brought our marketing spend down. You've seen that over the last few years, but don't assume that it's going to be down across the board in the back half of the year. So some of it might not be spent, but most of it is phasing, so. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of the World Cup, again, we're disappointed. I'm Australian, but I feel American. I've been here a long time and my kids are American so I feel for them. Although, I might say Australia really makes the World Cup. So I've lived with that dream for 43 years. The reality is, is the World Cup is the world's largest sporting event, and it's followed by all people around the world who love soccer or football depending on what they call it where they come from. And really, does it heighten their enjoyment if their national team is participating? Of course. But we don't see people stop watching a World Cup just because their team is not there. And as you think about the U.S. in particular, we are a very multicultural country, and even now as we think about FIFA, the most played teams are from Spain and the UK., and the most played players are also non-American players. So we don't expect a huge impact there, but for my kids and for me, I'm disappointed that the U.S. won't be there. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Maybe one follow up. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Sorry. So I was really intrigued by the statement that you made saying that the biggest disruption is streaming plus subscription, and you're saying that onboarding a large community of committed players lets you elevate the number of players. And I'm curious, is the value driver in your mind bringing new people onboard or getting more money from super fans, because it's an uncapped revenue stream? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: What we've seen in our subscriptions as we look at this is there's really two types of users of subscriptions : Those that do it because the friction is so low, you'd be mad not to do it, and those who do it because they are power users. In traditional linear media, you do not get the value out of a power user by virtue of the fact that subscription value is capped. We see subscription also doing the same thing in the context of games that we see this inside of our games, is we see gamers coming and participating in our existing subscriptions because the friction is low, the quality of the games is high and the opportunity to play games that they may never have played before is just too enticing for the value proposition. We also see players who come into the subscription as power players, who play multiple games. And in many cases, I think more than 75% of cases, played games they've never played before. They also participate in the live services of those games and drive additional incremental live service revenue on top of the subscription value. And so, as we think about this on a go-forward basis, we actually think about it capturing both of those categories that you mentioned. The kind of casual user who is looking just to access without friction and the power user who's looking to actually play everything and really invest a great amount of their time in the entertainment value that we provide. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: All right. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Yes. Thanks very much for the question. Just curious if you could give us a little bit of a range for all your titles that come out in a given year for console, what percentage of revenue is the $60 versus the add-on content live services dollars? And I know that could vary by game, but if you could sort of give us a range of how it plays out over a two-year period? And then secondly, wondered if you could give a little perspective on the competitive gameplay that you're going to have coming out for Battlefield 1 in the spring? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So let me hit the first one really quick. It really varies. In some titles, you'd have a 10% to 25% uplift off of the core, so $60 plus 25% of that. In some titles, they're going to be 125% or 150%. It also varies dramatically by region or geography because you have different spend capabilities around the world. So it's kind of hard to pare it down. Obviously, Ultimate Team is at the high end of the spectrum because it's so engaging and we're running so many events that it just keeps people coming back. So yes, it's hard to generalize. But it's really, we think about it really as how do we keep engaging players. And if they're engaged, they'll probably spend some money along the way and we want to make sure we've got people deeply engaged in something that they love. I'll let Andrew touch the second one really quickly and then we'll do one more question. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, for Battlefield, we don't have any new announcements for Incursions. It's currently in closed alpha and we're going to talk a lot more about that as the year progresses. But the things we've talked about so far is it will be a five-on-five player focused on contained small-scale battle. And it's unique in the fact that it will have both infantry and vehicle combat. And the feedback from the community so far has been really, really strong and positive, and we're integrating community feedback into this game. And again it comes off a great foundation. Battlefield is one of the great multiplayer games in our industry and Battlefield 1 was probably the greatest multiplayer game in the first-person shooter category last year. So we're very excited about the opportunity. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So one last question, so I can go trick-or-treating. Operator : And our final question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, Blake and Andrew, congrats on your quarter. Appreciate it. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Just, I gasp at asking you an accounting question, Blake, but revenue recognition on your FIFA sales, the digital was up. I think last year, you delayed the recognition of that into Q3. Is that somewhere this year? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, we don't formally delay it. We have a digital cut off that's a few days before the end of the actual end of the quarter, and that's just the way we work with our first parties. And so most of the FIFA digital revenue will come in Q3. The bulk of the revenue would either be people who pre-ordered a digital title or purchased digitally two or three days early because they were in EA Access. But almost all the regular digital purchases both for FIFA and for Ultimate Team are in Q3. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Got it. Good. One more follow-up for me, thank you. I know you have to be delicate to your retail partners, or your physical partners at least. But clearly the progression here to digital seems to be picking up some speed. Maybe it's inflecting. Who knows. But it looks like at least GameStop is working pretty hard to compete against new game sales by introducing a subscription plan on used. So just curious your thoughts on if at all, that could be disruptive to new game sales for you. And also curious, feels like maybe despite some sales, maybe there's over ordering of product over the holiday, which maybe is a catalyst of some of the promotions that we saw last year. Curious if you can do anything to manage that, and how reactive you can be to digital promotions in response? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, despite the fact that we've talked a lot about digital, it's an important part of our business, we still want to have great relationships with our physical retail partners out there and we think we do around the world. I can't comment on GameStop's intentions relative to their new program. I don't even really have the details about it yet. But we're obviously, we're very cautious of how we ship into all retailers. We've always been that way. We don't want the channel to be overly full, which would create discounting or could ultimately create financial problems for smaller retailers. So we've always watched that closely and we'll be careful again this year. The beauty of digital, as I think you were indicating, is we can be pretty fast and reactive. We can do one-day sales. We can do special promos in certain regions or countries. We can do a lot with digital in a short term that you can't necessarily do with long term. Most of our long-term plans for retailers are locked up six to 12 months ahead of time. And because you've got point-of-sale materials, you've got promotional flyers that go into newspapers, all of those things have to be prepared. And so we set those up well in advance and work with the retailers very carefully on those. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So with that, I'll call it quits so everyone can enjoy their Halloween and I appreciate everyone coming on the call this time. We'll talk to you in late January. Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Cheers. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

Q3 was a quarter defined by strong performances and important learnings for us at Electronic Arts. We love making games. It is a privilege to bring fun and entertainment to people all around the world. As we look across our games and services this quarter, we have a lot to be proud of. We brought hundreds of millions of hours of play to fans during the holiday quarter across console, mobile and PC. We also appreciate that our players have high expectations of us and the games we make and that passion drives us. As we push the boundaries with every new experience, we are continually listening, learning and taking action to serve our players. Now, let me touch on Star Wars Battlefront II. This was definitely a learning opportunity. You'll remember that we brought three of our top studios together on this project, and the result was a massive game with a new Star Wars story; space battles; and huge multiplayer variety. We wanted a game that would meet the needs of the vast and passionate Star Wars fan base, so we designed it with the intent of keeping the community together, and a commitment to continually add content long after launch. Given the newness of this design, we knew that player feedback during the pre-launch testing period would be key. Having made adjustments based on sentiment and community data coming out of the beta and early trials, we ultimately made the decision to pull in game purchases out of the game prior to launch. We never intended to build an experience that could be seen as unfair or lacking clear progression, so we removed the feature that was taking away from what fans were telling us was an otherwise great game. We are fortunate to have such passionate players that will tell us when we get it right, and when we don't. We're now working hard on more updates that will meet the needs of our players, and we hope to bring these to the Battlefront II community in the months ahead. Having made these changes before launch, Star Wars Battlefront II has been delivering fun to millions of players around the world, through the holiday season and beyond. With the breadth and depth of the game, fans spent twice as much time playing Battlefront II over the previous game during the launch quarter. The unique story of Iden Versio at the center of the game has drawn nearly 70% of players into the single -player campaign. Engagement has been strong in the first season of free post- launch content from The Last Jedi, and we're excited to bring new seasons to fans in FY19. As we grow this game with more content, we believe that Star Wars fans will continue to have fantastic experiences over the long life of Battlefront II. Going forward, we believe that live services that include optional digital monetization, when done right, provide a very important element of choice that can extend and enhance the experience in our games. We're committed to continually working with our players to deliver the right experience in each of our games and live services. Across the company, our fantastic creative teams are constantly pioneering new experiences that expand our reach, and add to the unmatched depth and breadth of our portfolio of games. There were many great examples of this throughout Q3, and I'll touch on a few of them here. FIFA continues to thrive as one of the world's leading entertainment properties. On console alone, our FIFA franchise had nearly 42 million players during the calendar year, and our FIFA 18 unique player base grew 10% year over year from launch through Q3. FIFA Mobile added another 26 million players in the quarter to its total player base more than any quarter in the last 12 months and millions more joined our FIFA experiences in Korea and China this year. Ultimate Team is more popular than ever across our EA SPORTS titles, and in FIFA Ultimate Team we had 12% more players' year-over-year from launch through Q3. In other areas of our portfolio, Battlefield 1now has more than 25 million unique player's life to date, putting it on a similar growth trajectory as Battlefield 4's massive community. The Sims 4 had another extraordinary quarter as we launched our highest performing expansion pack to date, and brought the game to consoles for the first time. Both of those contributed to player base growth in our Sims 4 community of more than 35% year-over-year in Q3. Need for Speed Payback also brought new experiences to longtime fans this quarter. On mobile, we're bringing more players into our network from across the world through the unique breadth and depth of our IP. From deeply engaged fans in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes to large, long -term communities in our EA SPORTS titles, The Sims FreePlay and more, our mobile games are reaching a wide and diverse audience and delivering years of high- value entertainment. Competitive gaming continues to be a major growth opportunity for us. We are bringing some of the biggest sports franchises in the world to the esports stage, and with new league partners, sponsors and broadcasters, our Madden NFL and FIFA competitions are reaching new milestones. The Madden Challenge special on The CW network was the number one esports television broadcast in the U.S. for 2017, and our Madden Challenge live finals in December drove our largest digital viewership to date for a Madden tournament. On the FIFA side, we just kicked off the Road to the eWorld Cup with the FUT Champions Cup in Barcelona last weekend. Digital viewership was massive; with more than 17 million total views that's half of last season's total views in just our first tournament of the year. We are also partnering with leagues like the MLS, Bundesliga, and more to bring competitive FIFA deep into their fan bases, expanding our global opportunity. Next, we're bringing competition to Battlefield, with online qualifiers set to begin in Q1 FY19. Across FIFA, Madden and Battlefield, this is going to be our biggest competitive Season yet for players and spectators. Looking to the quarter ahead, we're set to deliver a mix of amazing new games that will add to the breadth of our portfolio. First, later this week we will launch UFC 3. We have a great partnership with the UFC, and have worked hard over a two year development cycle to bring innovation across the entire game. With major UFC events coming in the months ahead, we're delivering UFC 3 at a very exciting time for the sport and its fans. During the fourth quarter, we will also launch the first two games from our EA Originals program, Fe and A Way Out. As you'll remember, we started EA Originals with a commitment to help independent developers bring unique and memorable games to the world. We can't wait to see fans come out and support these deeply -talented creators and the ideas they have brought to life in these games. Also in Q4, The Sims Mobile will launch worldwide on iOS and Android. This game is a major leap forward for the franchise, combining the unique Sims magic with new dimensions of social play. Sims players are some of our most diverse and committed fans, and with games like The Sims 4 and The SimsFree Play, we've shown how we build and deliver for these communities over many years. In FY19, we will push the boundaries even further for our players, with new experiences and constant innovation. It's a World Cup year, and with the largest sporting event on the planet set to reach billions of soccer fans, our EA SPORTS development teams are packing excitement into our next FIFA. Madden NFL, NHL, and NBA LIVE will all bring new dimensions of gameplay, self-expression and social connection. The Battlefield universe will grow this year with our next Battlefield title, captivating longtime fans and new players alike, and adding to our Battlefield service where players can move seamlessly with their friends. Our new IP, Anthem is a stunning project from BioWare that will blend genres with a shared world experience that evolves around its players. Excitement for Anthem is building, and we're deeply invested in delivering a great new experience with this game when it launches in Q4 FY19. In addition, we plan to launch two new mobile games built around fan -favorite IP; we'll grow in esports with competitions and broadcast content reaching more players and viewers; and we'll continue to deliver for players through our live services including Star Wars Battlefront II with more great content for the games they love. This collection of amazing games and content across more platforms, wrapped in live services, is at the core of the network we are building for our players. With competition, and subscription offerings that we will expand in new and innovative ways, we are reaching new audiences. Our amazing creative teams including the addition of the talented group at Respawn Entertainment Our Frostbite engine, our central technology platform and our Labs groups are putting us in position to be disruptive, and deliver the unexpected. We are excited to bring many more great experiences to our global network in this quarter and beyond. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake Blake Jorgensen : Thanks Andrew. Electronic Arts delivered earnings above our guidance absent of one time impact from tax reform. Sales of Stars Wars Battlefront 2 underperformed our expectations but event driven live services significantly exceeded them. This speaks to the stability of a business as diverse as ours with its broad portfolio of titles and mix of business model. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net booking to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.160 billion compared to $1.149 billion a year ago. Operating expenses were $680 million compared to $637 million a year ago with the year-over-year increase primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in live services. GAAP operating loss was $21 million compared to an operating loss of $4 million a year ago. And together with the charge from tax reform resulted in a loss per share of $0.60 compared with $0.00 a year ago. Almost all of the year-on-year change approximately $0.57 was due to the tax charge. Note, that given our GAAP result was a loss our share count was 308 million shares. Had we reported a profit the diluted share count would have been 311 million shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $849 million, down $288 million from last year. The decrease was driven by the timing of collection and be lower net bookings. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $825 million. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.514 billion. We remain on track to deliver operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the fiscal year which would be a new record. See our earnings slide for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $150 million leaving $778 million in our two year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. We also paid a $151 million in cash to acquire Respawn Entertainment. Our cash and short term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion with 36% of this balance held onshore. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.971 billion, down $99 million on the prior year, which benefited from a strong Battlefield 1 launch. Net bookings for the quarter were $29 million below our guidance driven by lower than expected sales of Star Wars Battlefront 2. For Q3, we had expected the sale of about 8 million units but we fell short of that by less than1 million units. However, this shortfall was significantly offset by excellent performance from our live services. The impact of FX was immaterial on the quarter. Digital net bookings were $1.23 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year period and a new record for the third quarter. The main driver of this increase was live services, offset by lower sales of Star Wars Battlefront 2 compared to Battlefield 1. Digital net bookings now represent 67% of our business on a trailing 12 months basis compared to 60% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings and turn. Live services net bookings were 39% year-on-year to $787 million. The increase was driven by Ultimate Team and The SIMS4; this was a record for the third quarter. Mobile delivery net bookings of $183 million, up 5% year-on-year also a record for the third quarter. Year-on-year growth was driven by FIFA mobile. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $260 million, 27% lower than last year driven by Star Wars Battlefront 2 compared to Battlefield 1 last year. This was partially offset by the underlying growth in digital downloads. Star Wars Battlefront 2 units on console were 28% digital, up 12 percentage point over Battlefront 1 two years ago. Across the portfolio, 37% of our full game unit sales were digital, measured on X box and play station 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 32% a year ago. Before turning to guidance, a brief note on tax reform. The enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a charge of $176 million in the third quarter. The charge is preliminary and includes a tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Also, while we are not changing our management reporting tax rate for fiscal 2018, we are still analyzing whether the new legislation will reduce this rate for fiscal 2019. In addition, because of new tax legislation and tax treatment for cash earned outside United States, it provides an opportunity for us to repatriate most of our foreign earnings. During the coming months, we'll reevaluate our capital return and investments strategy including our stock repurchases program and whether we should consider a dividend. We would expect to announce any changes on our next earnings call. On the guidance. We are raising our full year GAAP revenue guidance from $5.075 billion to $5.1 billion on strength of our live services. Our guidance for full year EPS becomes $3.25 excluding the impact of $0.48 from tax reform, this represents a $0.10 increase on our previous guidance. We are affirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $120 million which will deliver free cash flow of about $1.48 billion. We are reaffirming our guidance for net bookings at $5.15 billion but owing to the strength of our live services, we expect this to skew more digital than originally anticipated increasing our profitability. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.532 billion, cost of revenue to be $234 million and operating expenses of $690 million. Q4 OpEx is up slightly from our previous expectations driven by phasing of investments from Q3 and stock based compensation expenses related to the Respawn acquisition. It is up year-on-year primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in live services. This resulted earnings per share of $1.86 for the fourth quarter using the diluted share count of 311 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.225 billion. This is to raise our previous expectation and up 12% year-on-year driven by strength in live services. We continue to be excited about our opportunities for the future. Though the fourth quarter and through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we will be launching games across five different genres sports, action, shooter, real-time strategy and sim. We will launch them across three platforms : PC, console and mobile. And we will reach players in all corners of the world. We expect full-game downloads to continue to grow, and to see growth in subscriptions, extra content and in our mobile business. We expect esports will continue to drive growth in Ultimate Team as well as Battlefield and other titles. This will also grow our broadcast, sponsorship and advertising deals associated with our esports activities. This diversity in portfolio, platforms, geographies and business models is the foundation of a robust business that enables us to deliver dependable cash flow. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. Across the world, more people are playing more games, in more geography, through more devices and more ways to connect. It's a vast and growing audience in the billions, with increasingly diverse interests and high expectations. Reaching players with the fun and meaningful experiences they seek requires the best games and content available across multiple platforms. It requires more ways to engage with that content, including competition. And it requires a strong connection to the community - the openness and dialogue that make this industry so unique and powerful in the entertainment world. Today, EA has one of the most wide reaching portfolios of top games and franchises in the industry. Through FY19 and beyond, we are planning stunning new additions that will continue to grow the depth, breadth and quality of experiences we bring to fans around the world. Our DICE studio will deliver the next Battlefield, with innovation at every level, incredible stories at the core, astonishing visuals and game play that will captivate every Battlefield fan. Building on one of the strongest years ever for EA SPORTS, we're setting our sights to excite even more players, and deliver even more advanced experiences, with our next slate of games. Anthem will bring a rich and dramatic new world to players, built from the ground up by BioWare as a new IP that we believe will reach a wide audience and foster a long-term community. We'll take major leaps in our mobile portfolio with two new titles set for this year, and more to follow as we continue to focus on high quality, long lasting games. And there is so much more to come in the years ahead, with new projects in development at Motive, Respawn, and our other studios, as well as more games from indie developers in our EA Originals program. We're also creating more ways to connect with our franchises, including competitive gaming that reaches tens of millions of players and spectators. With FIFA and Madden, we've broken new ground, bringing global competition to some of the most passionate fan bases in all of sports. Now with league partnerships, broadcast partners and sponsors on board, we're driving even larger audiences with thrilling, high-stakes competition. Competitive Battlefield will open up a brand-new dimension of our esports programs beginning next fiscal year, and by the end of FY19 we will launch competition in a fourth title as well. Esports is also fueling opportunities for us in growth regions of the world, driving excitement with our players across China, Korea, the Middle East and more. In all of this, we are leading in service of our players, and strengthening the connections at the heart of our global network. We are constantly listening, learning, and working to make every player experience better. With our subscription services, we're removing friction so players can enjoy more of the games they love, and in FY19 we'll be doubling down with new offerings. By leveraging the cloud, we're exploring ways that streaming and other technologies will enable those experiences to be even more seamless. And through our Frostbite technology, we are pushing the boundaries in every aspect of games today. With an amazing collection of games and content, thrilling competitions for a global audience, and a network built on the strength of our player connections, EA is uniquely positioned to lead in the expansion and evolution of this industry that we love. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Chris Merwin : Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. So you got live service revenue growth of 39% in the quarter. I don't think we've seen that level of growth, quarterly growth since fiscal 2015. So wondering if you could help us understand the component of that a bit better and particular what drove such a strong acceleration and growth for Ultimate Team. And then just second question when it comes to live services, you mentioned a learning experience that you have Star Wars, so now when you think about how to build the digital economy for non-sports title, can you maybe a talk a bit about how your philosophy has changed there, if at all, and are you now more focused on cosmetic items, or do you still think collection mechanic can work for well for share or action title. Thank you very much. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks Chris. Let me I'll display I'll start with the digital question then let Andrew answer the second one. So we were very pleased with the live service growth and the strength of across all the franchises. I think first and foremost FIFA and Madden had fabulous ultimate team experiences during the quarter, great events driving continued deep engagement. The opportunities that we did with last year with FIFA to bring a single player story mode into the game helped drive ultimate team last year and FIFA continued that this year, the same thing occurred in Madden where it brought more people into Madden and it brought them into ultimate team. That in combination with the esports business that we've been building around ultimate team and those two properties has proven to be extremely exciting for the consumer and driving huge level of interest in ultimate team and participation in ultimate team. Beyond those two properties as well as hockey which continues to do well. And UFC is starting to grow and basketball starting to around ultimate team. The SIMS4 added a substantial amount to extra content live services. The continuation of our successful content packages that we shift with the SIMS4 was a very strong during the quarter and then as we brought the SIMS4 out on console that also started the process for the console side of the equation. So we are excited about the continued future of the SIMS4 and clearly that in mobile down the road. Battlefield 1 continue to help monetize live services and their extra content program and the combination of all of that really drove the massive growth in extra content during the quarter and helped balance out the business model. So and as I mentioned just a moment ago, competitive gaming we believe continues to be a big driver there going forward. We'll see that in the Battlefield franchise I think as Andrew mentioned. So that's the extra concept when let live services, let me Andrew address the other question. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. And a great question. We remain committed to a long term strategy of building amazing games that offer compelling adventure in the live services. And believe that digital economies can have place in those live services as we see that accepted across the industry now gains, added up in gain. But I think the greatest learning is that no single model and it's more of a how you can deliver the most engaging experience to players with new content and game update. So the same games like the SIMS, we continue to find that deal C packs through really well with the community. And that works well in that construct. We also know that when large games like Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront premium content after launch is value by the community but only where we can offer in a world where we don't bifurcate the community. And so it comes that being really careful and consider in designing model for post launch content that will be authenticate and engaging but most importantly offer player choice. And as you see us continually work on Star Wars Battlefront 2 and as you can see us continue to evolve in the broader venture and large service across our portfolio, at the very center of earnings we want offer its choice, player choice in a world that keeps the communities together. Operator : And your next question comes from Justin Post from BAML. Justin Post : Thank you for my question. I guess my question would be on future titles given some of the recent controversies. First, we talked about Anthem; it seems to be pushed out to the fourth quarter. What's your confidence in that build in that game? How do you think it's coming along and maybe a little bit why it was maybe delayed a bit? And then with Star Wars having some issues versus your guidance. How do you think about that as a franchise? Can that come back in two years and be really strong again? How are you thinking about that franchise? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : The first thing about Anthem is regardless of kind of how it's being portrayed, we are not looking at that as a delay in the game. We've chosen to launch Anthem in Q4 and the date is really determined by portfolio of balancing consideration not for product readiness reasons. It's tracking well on its development milestones. We are really confident of its ship date. We are really excited by the way the next battlefield is shaping up and it might set - it probably doesn't make sense to launch Anthem right up next to it. And when you think about Anthem as a brand new IP, we also believe it make sense to give it its own launch window so that we can give us a focus and attention that it deserve and give it some free air. In terms of Star Wars is ongoing and we remain committed to the franchise. We think the Star Wars Battlefront 2 is very core and is amazing game. The team is working diligently on update and extra content for the live services around Star Wars Battlefront 2. We expect to be - the response as I said in the prepared remarks is being really strong, the content we released so far. We expect the response to continue to be strong as we bring that content forward. And we are going to really look after that community and support and sustain that community, fulfill the commitment we made to them for a long time to come. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, Justin, just as a reminder, we have not obviously announced product for our fiscal 2020 yet but remember that we have a Star Wars action game that the team of respondent has been working on for the last couple of years. And most likely that would drop in fiscal 2020 versus another battlefront. We haven't decided exactly timing for another battlefront yet but clearly the next big Star Wars game would be the action game in fiscal 2020. Operator : And your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Thank you. So Andrew or Blake, it seems like to me FIFA mobile presents one of the largest incremental opportunities for you given the installed base of devices and the global popularity of soccer. So I am wondering what drove the 26 million player increased to the base and what you may be doing in the background to improve the game's performance. I think the dialogues today has been you guys were looking to optimize the game, just wondering if you guys have turned the corner here. Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Well, I don't know if I would say ever say turn the corner because it's a huge long term plan but we are seeing incredible improvement in the game. We are very excited about what we are seeing but it has been on the roadmap that we've been talking about. Similar roadmap that Madden followed two to three improvement cycle in game or constantly updating and building better, better events around for the players. And that's a same approach that we are taking with FIFA. It is now trending to be - they are number two or number three game depending where Madden is and behind Galaxy of Heroes. But it's really moving in a right direction. We are very excited, and we are continuing to tune it almost daily. The team is incredibly committed to making this one of the largest mobile games in the world and we think it certainly has the potential as you can imagine we are couple be part of that roadmap going forward and some exciting things coming there as well. Operator : And your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thank you for taking my question. I have two. Just the first one the strength of the FIFA and Madden for the team, another very good quarter. I was wondering did you talk the composition of that ultimate team live service growth between and bring new payers into ecosystem versus ARPU and maybe just some of the key that do you see to bring more payers in to the ecosystem going forward? And then second one kind of the bigger picture, over the last couple of years you talked a lot about diversifying away from non-sports titles. And unfortunately some of the non-sports titles have performed below expectation. As opposed to Madden I guess can you give us some examples of areas you see for opportunity to improve your ability to execute and consistently you kind of deliver the titles and really drive non-sport franchises through the company. Blake Jorgensen : Sure. I'll start on the ultimate team and then I'll let Andrew address the second one with the caveat and saying unless I checked last year's battlefield is one of the largest battlefields, it was the largest battlefield of all time. So I would probably say now put a little question in and how you say it our success rate in non-sports. So but to your point of live services around ultimate team, the biggest driver has been the continued to bring new people into the franchise. We grew the FIFA franchise this year and well double digit which is the largest game in the world probably one of the most amazing feat that we continue to do year in and year out through amazing innovation in the game and incredible improvement around the consumer experience, the gamer experience with the game. That plus bringing more people into ultimate team has really been the major drive. It is the single most popular way to play the game. People start to think about FIFA is really ultimate team more than they do other line game itself it's so exciting for people because it's constantly changing and it has new and exciting events every single week to bring people back. So it is truly a live service that has been driven every day and every week versus the single game. Madden follows that same trail as well as Hockey, UFC and Basketball and all of those efforts have been how do you bring more and more people into the ultimate team, overall versus how do you try to increase the ARPU on the people they are already there. We find that the ARPU increase happens naturally as people spend more time playing, but at the end of the day our effort is primarily on bringing more people into the franchise through us making sure they understand it, making sure they find ways to play it and enjoy it. For example, this year we addressed an issue where people who didn't want to play online they still want to play ultimate team, we created the modes so they can do that. So it's ways to continue to bring people into the franchise overall as well as in the ultimate team versus ARPU so. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And of the second part of the question I echo Blake's sentiment a little bit. As I look back over the last few years and we think about the SIMS which is continue to perform year-over-year. Battlefield 1 which in its year I think without - certainly the biggest battlefield and maybe the biggest shooter of the year. Plants vs. Zombie Garden Warfare which is a new IP that has done well at plus two iterations, Dragon Age : Inquisition which is not year with game of the year, even you look at Mass Effect involved, there were some polarizing sentiment in that franchise, it's actually performed really well and player engagement is really strong. And then it calls across mobile SIMCITY build it, the SIMS FREE PLAY and Star Wars Gods of Heroes all highly successful in their own market. So as I take a 50,000 foot view and look at the breadth and depth of our portfolio, across all of the games we make and even you look at last in 2017 in aggregate we were the highest reviewed publisher across portfolio. So there is a lot of real goodness there. With all that said, that doesn't mean we are perfect and there are always learning opportunity for us and we are a learning company. And as you look through our history over the last three or four years, there have been times we didn't quite get it right and we have put out player first commitment at the forefront of everything we do and we have worked tirelessly to ensure that we are able to support and sustain them. With the kinds of experience they expect from us. And so that has made, we have changed and be the process and we've changed the testing process, we have changed some of the lively design, we changed some of the ways we go to market. And as a company we will always be learning and always evolving and always making the right changes and services of players. But on balance, I think we had a really, really strong run on sports and non-sports. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\\ Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two. One on the EA original, how should we think about the sizing of the opportunities for those sorts of games, as well as maybe the marketing support that's needed for those games versus more traditional titles that you've seen that might have bigger budgets on both the development side and the marketing side? Second question, obviously we are the world's top in the calendar 2018, how do you think about framing of world cup, what it means for FIFA broadly as a franchise both in mobile and non-mobile broadly as you look out over the next 12 months? Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Let me take the first one. I'll let Blake take the second part. Again, EA originals for - is really build on a philosophical believe that we need to encourage all forms of game development to keep the industry healthy over time. We see this in the music business, we see this in the movie business and kind of world where today to compete with the likes often some of the other players in our development polishing space, and you need hundreds and millions of dollars. And that probably means some of the really interesting different working ideas never get to making into players hand. We believe that as a company with the kind of leadership position that we have that is actually our responsibility to help those games into the player's hands and through the process that probably means they are going to be giant games in the first part of it. And we don't look at it that way. But we do believe it is our responsibility and we think there is the chance as we work with these great creative developers who are doing really new and interesting and innovative things that we may find some great new IP for the future. And as we build those relationships to that kind into developers, we think it's an opportunity for us to continue to push the entire industry forward and give us access to some ideas that we may not otherwise see. Both inside the company or inside the industry. Blake Jorgensen : And just one final point from financial standpoint and you should assume that the financial impact is negligible. We would love these titles to become big breakout hits and we are not - I am not saying they won't. But right now in our guidance for the fourth quarter we are not planning a big revenue component of it. And we provide the profitability back to the developer. So it's not really a profit issue, some revenue generated but it won't be a very large for the quarter. But we do think there will be great games that live on for a long, long period of time on multiple platforms. In terms of World Cup and how we think about that. As you know, the World Cup doesn't start until the summer, so really fall into the next year's fiscal we will give you some details when we give guidance around what we think the impact of that will be. But as we have in the past, we had a long tradition of celebrating of the World Cup inside of FIFA and bringing it to live for our fans, that goes all the way back I think to World Cup '98 where we really started to going and we've got some exciting and fun things to announce that will come on later this spring before obviously the World Cup it's going. Since I am on next year, I might as well talk a little bit about Q1 just to make sure everyone remembers a few facts from last year. We expect 2019 to be a growth year for EA. We've talked about World Cup, continued strength in all of our sports titles, the emergence of the next battlefield which is extremely exciting as Andrew mentioned as well as our new IP Anthem. All of that should turn out to be a fabulous year for EA. The one thing I'd want to remind people is all that stuff comes past Q1, so as you are looking at Q1remember last year we benefited from a $53 million deferral of Mass Effect revenue into the quarter. We shift Mass Effect to the end of Q4 but there was a deferral on the premium revenue which shifts fairly high profitability revenue into Q1. And we benefited as well from some onetime adjustments when we shut down our distribution center in Switzerland. And so the combination of those two is probably were somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 of EPS. So just remember that as you are thinking about the quarter. Well, obviously give everyone quarterly data, the type of data that we give every year when we give guidance. But I just want to keep people aware of that as you think about next year's quarter. But we are very extremely excited for FIFA for World Cup for the year to come, it looks it's going to be another great year for EA. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Research. Ben Schachter : Few high level questions. One can you just talk about how your view of esports has evolved really over the past couple of years? You just talked about it as much more of sort marketing driver and now that's changed. Second question is just how do you think success of PUBG has impacted your development and why do you think it has been successful? And then finally, Blake, any update on potential new streaming models or expectations for new platforms? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : So I am going to let Andrew talk about esports and PUBG and then I'll talk about last question. Andrew Wilson : So I think what you are seeing right now is actually our strategy around esports coming to life. I don't believe there has been a material shift for us. We always believe that it's very cool, esports is going to drive tremendous engage - communities and allow us to reach broader communities of viewers who maybe never played our games before. And in doing so we would seek roads in the core digital businesses of the game that are featuring these sports. So you are seeing that right now in FIFA and Madden and we expect to see that in Battlefield also. What's actually happening is we are getting to a milestone quicker than we had planned. And we had always believe that over time as we build greater engagement, as we build greater viewership and as we added more titles to our portfolio of competitive games, that new opportunities around media rights, broadcast rights, sponsorship right would also come into play for us. And we are overjoyed with performance so far. Our competitive gaming group is doing spectacular work. The global player base in FIFA and Madden and we expect battlefield and future titles continue to engage and play these spectacular games and put on amazing entertainment for viewers and not just being that we are accelerating in terms of where we think all the growth effect is and profitable revenue might come from over time. In terms of PUBG, again I think what you discover in this industry is a lot of great vector that drive player engagement. And one of those is just innovation in the core game play mechanic. And the team with PUBG have done is really deliver a new level of innovation that change the way people were playing first and shooter game. And we are very respectful and complimentary what they have been able to do. We've seen that continue with fortnight. Again, so it's clearly a mode of play that the global FPS population interested in and given that we have some of the best shooters in the marketplace, you might expect that we are also thinking about new and innovative ways to play. And that doesn't mean just on a PUBG replicas inside of the battlefield universe but it does mean that our battlefield team and talked in prepared remarks, looking at how they innovate in every aspect of the game including core game play and map design. Blake Jorgensen : On the streaming question, I think as we've talked about before, we see as we look at the media industry we've seen one of the greatest disruptions has been the combination of streaming plus subscription. We think that combination is critical. And we see the ability to have live services which allows you to monetize on top of subscription is also incredibly important. And obviously that plays to our strength. We built a long history already in the subscription business and we have a long history in live services and we think the combination of that experience plus delivering through streaming maybe very important in this industry going forward. We've been doing some consumer streaming trials. We've done over both cable and traditional streaming over cable as well as now through the use of local clients to help streaming through datacenters. We are obviously have a very successful subscription experience both on EA access as well as origin access and with the building actively as part of the investments that we've been making our player network through technology infrastructure internally that helps players' transition and connect with friends experiences, experiencing more content across multiplatform. We think that's important and also very important in the streaming world. And we've been working some of the largest partners out there on potential business models for streaming. We will continue that work and we'll continue work on the technology side ourselves. And I'd say that between in the next two to five years you'll see some major movements there with probably some testing that occurs on the shorter side of that versus the longer side maybe ever earlier. More to come but it's obviously something we've been trying to investing across many different vectors and we are extremely excited about it. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Gee from Barclays. Ryan Gee : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my call. So we really appreciate the color on the unit sales for Star Wars. I was hoping you guys could just clarify what are you doing to restructure the MTX portion of Star Wars and assuming that you guys are still committed delivering content for sale, how should we think about the timeline there? And maybe how many full Star Wars could be the top and bottom line in year two of its life? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So I think as we talked about it in the prepared remarks, we believe that digital economy have a place in event driven live services and our plan is absolutely to continue to drive and focus and deliver on that. And the teams are working on how that will fit in the context of Star Wars Battlefront 2 universe and we expect over the next coming months we will have more to share on that front. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. In terms of financial, Ryan, I think you know we are inherently conservative and how we try to forecast and we did not build very much revenue at all into this year's forecast for Star Wars. And while we haven't given guidance yet as we are doing our budgets for next year internally, we are assuming that until we have a proven model that we are confident off, we are probably not going to build a lot into our budget either i.e. than into our guidance. More to come when we give our guidance but don't take that as a negative in any way. It's simply conservatism around how we are trying to drive the business. As Andrew said, it's very important to us long term because we think it's very important how fun the games are and how people will enjoy the game. We just make - we just need to make sure we get the model exactly right. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thanks so much for taking my call. If we remove World Cup I think for a second and just starting about FIFA medium and longer term, where is the opportunity in growing that franchise? Is it kind of increasing the player base, increased ARPU? And on the gaming side, you've added a lot of new features in the past couple of years. Is there still room for more features? Andrew Wilson : Great question. As we think about FIFA the beauty of FIFA and greatness of FIFA is the soccer or football in many parts of the world is the world's game. And just goes from strength to strength across the globe. And so really the opportunity with FIFA is really, really strong. And we think about on a few key vectors. And I always involve at first level growing the total addressable market. So right now we have tremendous geographic expansion opportunities a little bit about our China presence and well it's doing there, the Middle East is opening up is a tremendous opportunity for FIFA. The US continues to grow; South East Asia continues to grow. And the passion quite frankly across Europe continues to grow. Next we think about this in terms of platform expansion. And as consoles continue to grow and again there are more consoles saw this generation than any other generation before on play station and X Box, PC is kind of - is making a resurgent for gamers and feedback that there is very strong PC presence. We talked that in prepared remarks around mobile. And Blake talked a little bit about how we think about streaming long term. So really remove the barriers to entry to bringing more people. And then two of the most powerful motivators of human behavior on the planet competition and social interaction. And so as you think about the types of game and features that we will continue to build inside of the FIFA universe as we bring these multi billion global community of football fans together, a feature that actually drive greater social interaction as a sports fan the thing I want to do most is interact with sports fans. And as a competitor I think I want to do most is compete. And you are seeing this now around our competitive modes. But you should also expect as we branch out in geographies and platforms and new access models like streaming and subscription that features around social interaction and competition continue to be at the very core what we do and we think there is still tremendous opportunity there. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. And I would add to that one of the things that made FIFA so successful for us is the deep partnerships that we build with the league out there. And today we don't have all the leagues so we are constantly looking at what leagues are emerging, what leagues are extremely strong and where can we better partner with leagues going forward. And it has been a fabulous way to help grow the business and help grow the support of football around the globe. The leagues see us a major way that they can market their product, their players, their teams, their stadium and we see it as obviously as perfect business combination for us. And so part of our growth strategy going forward particularly in new geographies is to how do you make sure you have the leagues for those geographies. But even in matured geographies where we might not be fully exposed to all the leagues, we are trying to make sure that we are driving that. It's an incredible competitive advantage for us to be able to have those deep partnerships and we are going to continue to try to leverage those to help grow the product across all the platforms that Andrew talked about, mobile, streaming, PC and the core console business. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter. Two on loop boxes, one sort of ground level, I am curious if Disney is formulated any sort of opinion on whether they are comfortable with that sort of monetization mechanic and battlefront or future games. And then maybe from a higher level how should we think about bounds of risk in any sort of constructive framework emerging around loop box, and maybe how you think about if you do see that as a risks, how are you thinking about mitigating that as a company or and/or as an industry? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : So first I would choose my words carefully. You shouldn't believe everything that you read in the press. We have a tremendous relationship with Disney. We have built some amazing games together Battlefront, Star Wars Gods of Heroes and even Star Wars Battlefront 2. And we have been very proactive in that relationship and service about players. And so at a point where we make the decision that we believe we have the right model for our players and our global community, I have no doubt that we will get the support of Disney on that. And again as we look forward, the big learning is there is no one size fit all when it comes event driven live services. But at the very core we must always build on the foundation of player of choice. And that might be the choice of whether a player engages in a particular mode or not, that might be whether a player decides to grind for something or not. But in all things it's around providing a fair playing field with players feel they have choice. And you should expect that we will continue to drive hard against that and ensure that again we didn't set out as I said in the prepared remarks to build the feature set that could be perceived to be anything other than fair. It's clear that we didn't quite get that balance right. But we are doubling down now to ensure that we do it. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I'll just add we do not believe that loop boxes and similar mechanics are form of gambling. I think there are a plenty of governments around the world that have agreed with us on that. And there isn't just us it is the entire industry. We work very carefully and closely with all of our industry partners and the ESA the industry body to make sure that people understand exactly what loop boxes are, exactly why they are not gambling and we will continue to engage in that going forward. We think that's important and I think there is a lot of consumers who would argue the same thing based on their great experience they have with fun games to have associated live services with them, that some maybe misconstruing as a loop box or a gambling mechanism. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Mike Olson : Hey, good afternoon. Just one question for me. You mentioned full game download continue to grow. I guess not surprise. So what did you say was in December high 30s as percent of the mix, I think something like that. And what are your expectations for calendar 2018, will we see like 10 points of growth over the next year, should we expect more incentives from either kind of film makers or publishers to push that trend. And then also is it still the case that full game downloads is 15 to 20 points better gross margin wise, or is anything changed on that front? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Nothing is changed on the margin front. We finished the year around 37 for the calendar year around 37%. And as you know we are still little below the industry. I think the industry is getting closer to 40%. We skew a little lower due to the global nature of FIFA and then also battlefront 2 while it came up 12 points from battlefront 1, still skewed in the high 20s versus the high 30s primarily due to the gift giving and a younger audience base. But we see all the right trends helping that. We feel have our forecast is kind of 5 plus points a year. Obviously, we have been on a low side of that for the last couple of years. But I think at a minimum we should see five points of increase each year and hopefully it's greater than that. We don't see a cap any time soon because we know more and more players are realizing it's more convenient, easy and engaging way to play. Many players have been already buying extra content and thus have a way to have digital purchases as part of their overall game play. And we believe the consumer will ultimately default towards convenience however that might be, it might be they still have store around the corner from him, or it might be that he don't and it's easy for them to buy digitally. But you'll see us continue to do things to try to encourage people to buy digitally and we think that's still major key as part of the future business. Blake Jorgensen : With that I think we are out of time. I appreciate everybody's great questions and interest. And we look forward to seeing everyone over the next few months, as well as talking again at the end of our Q4 when we will give guidance for fiscal 2019 in early May. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. FY 2018 was a year of growth and continued transformation for Electronic Arts and a year where our commitment to putting players first grew even stronger. We expanded our global player base, grew engagement in our leading games, live services, and subscriptions, and continued our focus on listening and learning from our communities. Our revenue and earnings for Q4 and the fiscal year 2018 were above our guidance given in January, and we are well positioned for continued growth in FY 2019. Our strategy is to deliver a collection of amazing games and content wrapped in services with new and innovative ways to reach an expanding global audience. Here are a few of our achievements in the year just completed. Our EA SPORTS franchises FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and UFC continue to be some of the most powerful sports brands in the world. In FY 2018, our EA SPORTS player base grew to nearly 90 million players life to date on current-generation consoles, and many tens of millions more across mobile and PC. Our sports games are also powerful platforms for competitive gaming. Nearly 18 million players engaged in competition across FIFA 18 and Madden NFL 18 this season, up more than 75% year over year. And viewership of our top level competitions continues to break records on networks and digital channels. We are growing our reach across all platforms. Our Battlefield ecosystem of games has more than 54 million players life to date across current-generation consoles and PC, as fans continue to play their favorite Battlefield titles for years after launch. Our Sims community spans across generations and platforms, with more than 80 million active Sims players across PC and mobile in FY 2018. Our Sims 4 community continues to grow nearly four years after launch, and we have a great deal more content coming to our PC players this year. Alongside the ongoing success of the Sims FreePlay, we've had strong early growth in the player base for The Sims Mobile, giving us two games on mobile delivering the breadth of experiences that Sims fans are looking for. FY 2018 was our strongest year ever for the EA mobile portfolio. Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes continues to have one of our most committed and deeply engaged fan bases, driving player satisfaction scores to an all-time high in Q4. Our EA SPORTS titles SimCity BuildIt, Real Racing 3, and more continue to entertain global communities on a daily basis, and we will add more breadth and depth to our portfolio in FY 2019. We also helped players experience more games, including innovative new IP. Our EA Access and Origin Access subscriber titles continue to grow, and we've expanded Origin Access to include dozens of third-party titles in addition to EA's PC portfolio. And with our EA Originals program, we saw outstanding success with A Way Out, the innovative co-op game from Hazelight that engaged nearly 2 million players in the first four weeks after launch. Through all of these examples and many more, we hold an unfaltering commitment to our communities. We will also always push forward to innovate and create new experiences. That's in our DNA. We also continue to listen, learn, and act in service of our players. We have a deep appreciation and commitment to our Star Wars fans. And as promised, we delivered a major redesign of the progression in Star Wars Battlefront II in Q4, updating it to a more linear system that our players wanted. We've also brought new content modes and fan requested updates to the game, and we have much more coming to the launch of the new movie Solo : A Star Wars Story. As we begin FY 2019, EA is uniquely positioned to lead. Through our investments in IP, technology, competition, and new ways to play, our talented teams continue to deliver new experiences that will disrupt and expand the future of play. There is no bigger event in sports than the World Cup, and we're excited to kick off an unprecedented year of new experiences across our FIFA franchise with our new World Cup content in FIFA 18. As we announced last week, we are bringing all the teams, matchups, and so much more of the World Cup experience and making it all free for FIFA 18 players. Building on the momentum of World Cup, we then have some very exciting plans for FIFA 19, which we'll speak to at EA PLAY in June. This is a major year for EA SPORTS across all platforms, with more innovation coming to Madden NFL, NBA Live, and NHL as well as our EA SPORTS titles on mobile and FIFA Online 4 going live soon in China and Korea. This year we also plan to deliver two massive new games, our next Battlefield title and our new IP, Anthem. Both of these experiences are introducing new dynamics that begin to change the way fans interact with their games and with each other. With our next Battlefield game, the team at DICE is bringing the intensity of combat to life in new and unexpected ways. Every battle is unique and every mode brings its own challenges, from the way you interact with the environment around you to compelling single-player stories to the next level of large-scale multiplayer that spans across multiple maps and modes. This will be a deep and fully featured shooter and ongoing service that will evolve with major new experiences for our community, beginning right from launch. Building on the success of Battlefield 1 and taking inspiration from DICE's core DNA, the new game will advance the state of the art for the franchise while still delivering a signature gameplay and Battlefield moments that have captivated and grown our global community. Later in the fiscal year, we will launch our stunning and ambitious new IP, Anthem. Every dimension of this game will offer something entirely new for a wide audience of players. From a new universe with unique stories that BioWare is creating to the cooperative gameplay to the epic and beautiful environment that constantly evolves around players, Anthem is a fundamentally social experience and will open new ways for fans to join the community and play early, enabling us to shape and refine the game with their input and feedback. We're deeply excited to launch this brand new franchise and equally excited to work with our players to make Anthem a game they can't wait to play and share with their friends for years to come. EA's mobile portfolio will continue to grow in FY 2019. In recent years, our mobile games have been some of the most engaging new games to enter the marketplace. We are doubling down in FY 2019 with two new titles, Star Wars : Rise to Power and another game we'll reveal at EA PLAY, both unlike anything else in our mobile lineup today. Each game crosses into new genres with social layers designed to bring together global communities. In competitive gaming, we continue to expand our global esports audience of viewers and players that are experiencing the thrill of high-stakes competition through FIFA and Madden NFL. This year we will grow our competitive footprint with more franchises, events, broadcast content, and sponsorship. We'll hold our first Battlefield competitions in FY 2019, and we're set to bring competition to another new title later this year. In FY 2019, we will also continue to lead with innovation in our subscriptions and new technologies. We will introduce a new offering to one of our industry-leading subscription programs, delivering unprecedented access and value. Our advanced technology development, including cloud gaming, AI, and Frostbite will enable us to create and deliver next-generation experiences at scale. All of these and more continue to fuel the future of our player network that will connect players across games and devices. There has never been a more exciting time to be making games. Our industry is dynamic, evolving, and full of new opportunities. With the updates to our organization and structure that we announced last month, EA is positioned for continued growth and leadership. We will push the boundaries of entertainment in a world where change is accelerating. We will strive to be the disruptors shaping the future of play. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Fiscal 2018 was a record year for Electronic Arts as measured against almost every major financial metric, from revenue to operating income to cash flow. Our success is driven by the way we have changed and continue to change our relationship with players. They want more depth in their favorite games and fresh content that can hold their attention year-round. As a result, we've gone from one-off interactions at a moment in time to ongoing engagements with consistently changing dynamic worlds. It's a situation analogous to the transition we've seen in the software-as-a-service industry. Consequently, our business already looks very SaaS-like, with live services and subscription making up a greater and greater portion of our revenue. This has made our business much more stable and enabled us to deliver a dependable and growing cash flow to investors. Now I'll provide our results on a GAAP basis before using our operational metric of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of the business. EA had a record year, with net revenue of $5.2 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.4 billion. These results enabled us to deliver record operating cash flow of almost $1.7 billion. We also returned over $600 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Total net bookings for the year were $5.2 billion, a record. Digital net bookings accounted for 68% of this, up 7 percentage points year on year. Live services net bookings were a record $2.2 billion. Net of hedges, FX was immaterial to net bookings and a slight headwind to underlying profitability. Now moving on to the details of our fourth quarter, GAAP net revenue was $1.6 billion, $50 million above our guidance and $55 million above the year-ago period. Cost of revenue was $233 million, in line with our guidance of $234 million and up from $202 million last year. Operating expenses were $596 million, $23 million below our expectations and $12 million less year over year. This drove diluted earnings per share of $1.95, or $0.09 higher than guidance and $0.14 higher than last year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $615 million. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year was a record $1.69 billion, beating our guidance of $1.6 billion and up 7% over last year's. Fiscal year 2018 capital expenditures were $107 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. At the end of the quarter, we held $5.33 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $148 million. Today, we announced that we have replaced our old share repurchase program with a new $2.4 billion two-year stock repurchase program. We returned about 38% of our free cash flow to investors in fiscal 2018. This new program aims to return approximately three-quarters of our annual free cash flow. We believe this is an appropriate target based on our current cash needs, our ability to access international cash, and our desire to maintain flexibility for future growth investments. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings were $1.26 billion, above our guidance of $1.23 billion and up from $1.09 billion last year. Digital net bookings delivered $1.05 billion of the $1.26 billion total, up from $885 million last year. This increase was driven by our ongoing success with our event-driven live services. Looking at each component of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn, live services net bookings were up 31% year on year to $679 million. The increase was driven by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, and Battlefield 1. By adding features to broaden Ultimate Team's appeal, layering in a packed calendar of events, and building esports on top of that, the team is continuing to grow fun and engaging games that players want to come back to time after time. Mobile delivered net bookings of $176 million, roughly flat year on year. Strength in Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile was offset by anticipated decline in some of our older games. Full-game PC and console downloads generated $193 million, roughly flat year on year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront II and strength in FIFA 18, offset by the success of Battlefield 1 in the prior year. The long-term trend towards downloading games continues. And across the portfolio, 39% of our full-game unit sales were digital measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 33% a year ago. Turning to our expectations for fiscal 2019, we expect sales of current-generation consoles from Microsoft and Sony to continue to be strong, with the installed base growing to 130 million consoles by the end of calendar 2018 from 103 million at the end of calendar 2017. Nintendo Switch is expected to have built an installed base over 30 million by the end of the calendar year. In dollar terms, we expect the PC gaming software market to be approximately flat and the mobile market to grow in the mid-teens in the calendar year. A note on accounting for fiscal 2019, as mentioned, we have adopted ASC 606 going forward. This does not materially impact our net bookings metric, but it does change our GAAP reporting in several ways. Most significantly, more of our GAAP revenue will be recognized up front, bringing GAAP reported numbers closer to our historical non-GAAP reporting. Also, as a result of the introduction of ASC 606, we will now be reporting most of our mobile GAAP revenue on a gross, not net, basis. We will continue to report the metrics that enable you to bring back to measures comparable to our historically reported numbers, including mobile net bookings. These and other issues are discussed in more detail in the expanded accounting FAQ we posted on our IR website today. Primarily as a result of the changes in the U.S. tax law, we are reducing our management tax rate from 21% to 18%. Guidance for fiscal 2019 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.6 billion, cost of revenue of $1.6 billion, and GAAP EPS of $3.55. This outlook was prepared in accordance with the new ASC 606 standard, and includes approximately $300 million of additional mobile revenue resulting from the accounting change to reporting mobile revenue on a gross, not net, basis. With regard to cash flow, for fiscal 2019 we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.7 billion. CapEx is up year on year as we invest in IT infrastructure for our player network and upgrade facilities, including the Respawn offices in Los Angeles. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 7% year on year. This is driven by growth in live services, mobile, and Battlefield. We have disclosed the phasing of net bookings through the year in our slide deck. As a result of the timing of launches, we expect this year to be more back-end loaded than fiscal 2018. We're excited about how both Anthem and Battlefield are shaping up, and we look forward to sharing more with you about them soon. Our projections assume a benefit from FX to net bookings of over $100 million and an extra $30 million in OpEx relative to last year's rates. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, net bookings for packaged goods and other are forecast to be approximately $1.5 billion, down 9% year on year, driven by the shift to digital. Digital net bookings are expected to contribute $4.1 billion, up 14% year on year. Further breaking down digital net bookings, we expect live services to grow 10% to 15%, led by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4 expansion packs for PC and console versions of the game, and by growth in our subscription business. The World Cup will have a positive effect on FIFA Ultimate Team engagement, but remember, it's only a four-week event split across Q1 and Q2, and we have modeled that accordingly in our revenue forecast. With regards to our mobile business, The Sims Mobile launched just before the year end, and we have two games coming in the second half of the year. Thus, we expect our mobile business to grow strongly, on the order of around 15% to 20%, led by The Sims Mobile, FIFA Mobile, Star Wars : Rise to Power, and the unannounced title. Note that this growth forecast is based off of our net bookings metric, not gross revenue or gross bookings. Net bookings for full-game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%, driven by product mix and the ongoing change in consumer behavior. We continue to model an underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital. Focusing on Q1, we're expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.1 billion, GAAP cost of revenue of $226 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.64. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $720 million, slightly down year on year. As discussed on our last call, Q1 fiscal 2018 benefited from the deferral of over $50 million of net booking from Mass Effect : Andromeda and some other one-time events. On a management reporting basis, OpEx will grow year on year, as we continue to invest in our growth drivers. As we look ahead to Q2, we see growth in FIFA and mobile particularly offset by declines in other areas, including a difficult comp against Battlefield 1's performance in fiscal 2018. We discussed the idea of recurring revenues at our Analyst Day two years ago. At the time, about 75% of our net bookings fit into this category. Since then, we've continued to push our business in that direction, and our guidance implies that 85% of our net bookings in fiscal 2019 are expected to be recurring. Our drive to greater recurring revenues and cash flow will be fueled by our investments in subscriptions, live services, esports, broadcasting, and cloud gaming. These are all components of our Player Network strategy, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we continue to pioneer their adoption. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. We're excited to begin another year in our journey at Electronic Arts, at a time where there is so much passion for games around the world. As an industry, we are reaching an amazing nexus, where the creative energy in game-making is intensifying and converging with technology innovation that is unlocking gateways to access, delivery, and sharing of game experiences on a global scale. Games are becoming a truly ubiquitous form of entertainment, we believe the best form of entertainment. And through the evolutions to come, we are seeking to connect more players to amazing games and to each other. Creativity is the central strand of everything we do at EA. Every experience begins with creating something new and unexpected. That's why you'll see new dynamics in gameplay, new social layers, and new ways to interact with the worlds we create in games like Anthem, our next Battlefield, and our new mobile titles. It's powering new projects in development at Respawn, Motive, EA Vancouver, Criterion, and more. It's behind our EA Originals program and our commitment to support indie developers with amazing ideas. It drives us to continually evolve and update our games through live services because the creative cycle in service of our player never ends. This isn't just a creative revolution. It's also a revolution of access and choice. New forms of content, new consumption models, and advanced technology investments are accelerating how we will reach more players in a networked world and satisfy their unique needs. Whether you're a player or a viewer, our competitive gaming experiences for games like FIFA, Madden NFL, and more are becoming must-see programming for fans around the world. With more games and content available to players today, subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access are continuing to build momentum, and we are pioneering new offerings that will expand how players can experience more of the best games. Looking further ahead, the combination of subscriptions and cloud gaming capabilities combined with our Frostbite engine and digital platform will power the growth of our Player Network that scales across games, devices, and geographies. At the center of this are our players and our global communities. Everything we do is in service of our players, and we grow stronger in this commitment every day. This year, we will continue to expand how we connect with our players early and often, from thousands of hours with our studio teams and play-testing, to large-scale soft launches and early play opportunities. One month from now, we'll open up our annual EA PLAY event, in what has become a cultural moment for games and our communities. We'll welcome tens of thousands of players that join us in Hollywood to go hands-on and millions more that join us online around the world to hear more about our games and services, our commitments, and our plans for the future. At every touchpoint with our players, in our games, in our network, in our communities, and beyond, we are constantly working to bring them closer to the games they love. In FY 2019, we are set to take major steps forward towards our vision of a networked future and our opportunity to connect 1 billion people in play. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the months to come. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Just looking quickly, Blake, and I don't want to quibble about the size of your buyback, but you've got free cash flow this year of $1.7 billion, and you're going to do a buyback, assuming you do it on an even pace, of $1.2 billion. So you're already sitting on cash of about $5.3 billion or $17 a share, and you'll add another $500 million or so to that. I'm assuming you're going to repatriate a lot, so you'll definitely have a lot more cash flow to play with. I wondered what are your other opportunities or what you're thinking about with your excess cash? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: The call is only 30 minutes gone by and I'm already being criticized for doubling the buyback. It's amazing. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : It's a high-quality problem. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: It's a high-quality problem, and I appreciate the question. It's a good question. Our view is, in today's world, financial flexibility has huge power to it. And we want to return as much to shareholders. We've consistently, over the last four years, grown that buyback fairly dramatically and will continue to do that as we continue to build. But we also want to maintain flexibility should something happen that we either want to deeper invest in or want to purchase something. I'm not signaling that anything's happening. I think you guys know we've been consistent in how we grow the buyback, but also try to be prudent and safe with our capital to prepare for potential opportunities down the road. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : All right, thanks, and then just one follow-up question. The new Star Wars mobile game, will you still be supporting Galaxy of Heroes? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Without a doubt. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Are they complementary games, and can you market between those two games? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, yeah, without a doubt. The perfect example of that is if you look at our Sims FreePlay game, which has been around for four or five years, has not gone down at all with the introduction of the new Sims mobile game. Mobile games have \u2013 there are so many audience members out there. There are so many opportunities, and game styles are very different. The game style between the new Star Wars game and Galaxy of Heroes is going to be very, very different, different style audience. And we think both will remain extremely successful for a long period of time. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Blake, I just want to ask about the guidance, net bookings growth of mid-single digits and low double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth. Can you talk about the lack of leverage there? Last time you guys grew top line at a comparable rate, you achieved 25% earnings growth. That was back in fiscal 2016. Your book tax rate is 300 basis points lower, and you're buying back more stock, which I would assume is accretive. So I just want to understand the puts and takes behind the earnings growth that you're forecasting. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Let me hit just real quick on the buyback. We don't build the buyback into our forecast because we don't like to forecast what stock price is going to be. But assuming that the buyback \u2013 assuming the stock price is where it is today, you'd probably see $0.04 to $0.05 of earnings accretion going forward. You'd probably see share count down to around 308 million by year end, in other words, if you want to do the math that way. I'd say the other issue is back in fiscal 2016 we were not investing as much in the future. I think we were still coming through the tail end of the transformation. We are now investing much more heavily in the future, and you see that in our OpEx growth. And that's trimmed some of the earnings growth power, at least in our guidance. Remember, this is guidance, not actual results. And I think if you went back a couple of years, you'd see the same pattern as we've given annual guidance. But I do think what you heard from Andrew earlier is continued investment in both new IP as well as way people will play games in the future and the way games will be delivered in the future. Investing in our network, investing in subscriptions, investing in cloud gaming, you're going to continue to hear and see those investments from us over time because we believe that's the way this business will be transformed. But at the same time, we're going to always look to get earnings leverage, and we think that that model is pretty consistent with how it's been in the past. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, one more for me. Just any update on the release window for Battlefield? Historically, you guys have targeted October. It looks like a very crowded window this year. Any opportunity to push that out later in the December quarter? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes, you'll hear more about E3 timeframe on Battlefield. You'll hear quite a bit coming up about the game and the plans for it. We're very excited. But you should assume \u2013 back to your guidance question, you should assume that we built in the guidance some conservatism and caution because we know it's going to be a crowded third quarter for us, fourth quarter calendar year. But the benefit that we have \u2013 I think that we've always had is we have a very strong Battlefield community, and we think they're going to be extremely excited about this new Battlefield game. And we've been able to compete against others like Call of Duty in that same timeframe in the past, and we will work hard to try to do that going forward. But more to come on exact timing and a lot more about the game, which is pretty exciting. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. I just have a couple. First for Blake, even with the backdrop of Fortnite, yet another very strong quarter on live service, up about 30% year on year. Was it FIFA Ultimate Team and competitive gaming that were the main driving force behind that, or was there anything else that you would call out like Star Wars and MTX, which I think you brought back late in the quarter? And then just a second question for Andrew, there have been some reports in the press about a couple countries labeling loot boxes as illegal gambling and going for the removal from games. I know in FIFA, you've made some efforts to ensure that in-game currency can't be redeemed for real currency in any sort of illicit market. So maybe can you update us on where talks stand with regulators on this topic and how we should think about any changes to the Ultimate Team mechanic in the affected countries? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on the live service piece, it was Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden, and hockey and to a smaller extent NBA, but really Ultimate Team number one driver. Sims 4, number two driver, and that's been consistent through the year. It's been extremely strong as we continue to add extra content to that game. And Battlefield 1, we're at the tail end of extra content along Battlefield 1. Battlefront was not a major addition since, as you mentioned, MTX came in very late in the quarter. But the other thing to remember is the breadth of our extra content, subscription, advertising, all the other components continue to add up and help us build that base that we've been able to build, now over $2.2 billion, is what's so great about that live service business because it continues to maintain a fairly large consistency year-over year. I'll let Andrew hit the loot box piece now. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes and good question and certainly timely. As you might imagine, we're working with all the industry associations globally and with regulators in various jurisdictions and territories, many of whom we've been working with for some time and have evaluated and established that programs like FIFA Ultimate Team are not gambling. And we don't believe that FIFA Ultimate Team \u2013 all loot boxes are gambling. Firstly, players always receive a specified number of items in each FUT pack. And secondly, we don't provide or authorize any way to cash out or sell items in virtual currency for real-world money. And there's no way we can make value assign to FUT items in game currency. And while we forbid the transfer of items of in-the-game currency outside, we also actively seek to eliminate that where it's going on in an illegal environment, and we work with regulators in various jurisdictions to achieve that. And so net-net, we're going to continue to push forward. We're always thinking about our players. We're always thinking about how to deliver these types of experiences in a transparent, fun, fair, and balanced way for our players. And we'll communicate with regulators around the world on it. Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon and nice quarter again. First off for me, without creating a separate SKU for World Cup this time around, I wonder if you could talk in a little more detail about the monetization strategy within the core game. And then secondly, looking at the phasing of the year in terms of revenues, it looks like the fourth quarter is expected to be similar to this past year, and I wonder what that means in terms of your expectations for Anthem, given that you also have the Battlefield content in Q4 as well. Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I'll take the first and I'll let Blake take the second one. As it relates to FIFA, what we've come to understand over the years, and many of you might remember, I worked on this franchise for a long time and built both FIFA and World Cup games. And as each year passed and digital became a more prevalent way for our players to access games and connect with each other through games, liquidity in the player base became really, really important. And players weren't wanting to opt out of one experience to play another soccer experience. And so part of why we brought the two experiences together in our core FIFA experience and what is the biggest sporting event in the world in the World Cup is really deliver on the needs and requests and motivations of our players to stay connected in a global soccer community. And as we've announced, we're releasing all of the content, all the teams, and things around the World Cup to allow people to play offline and online. But you should expect that for all of our players in FIFA Ultimate Team, they'll be very, very specific and interesting and entertaining and enjoying and engaging live service events in and around the World Cup. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on the guidance piece, a couple things I think you'll note. We didn't use unit sales metrics for any of our titles. And as you've heard in the past, we're trying to move away from that. This is an example of how our business model has changed. Unit sales are much less indicative of long-term franchise health due to the significant power of our event-driven live services now. The live services component is really the bedrock of our business. And while units sold to grow that are important, they become misleading in many ways to the Street. And so we'll stay away from unit predictions for any titles going forward unless there's some unique reason for it. In the case of Anthem, the real issue is, the game will be shipped in the last quarter of the year and in the last month of that quarter, meaning we'll probably have limited restocking of the title, even if it's extremely successful. Since it is new IP, we're being conservative in how we're thinking about it. We're very excited about the game. It's extremely unique, and I think players are going to really enjoy playing it, but we're careful not to put too large of a forecast in there. And clearly, it will impact this year as well as next year as we not only continue to sell more into the next year but start rolling out the live services associated with that game. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Andrew, you talked a lot about extending gameplay as you look out for the future of gaming. I wanted to know if you can give us your perspective on the title mix and what you see as some of the key titles, especially with respect to mobile, where you could extend gameplay beyond console and PC into a mobile-first world and how you think about the pace and cadence of that going forward. And then following up on I think it was Drew's question from before for Blake, anything you want to call out in terms of the pace or cadence of R&D and marketing as we go through the year quarter by quarter given the way that you laid out revenue and bookings, just so maybe we have some guideposts to think about margin evolution as we go through the year? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So let me grab the first one. At its very core, you've heard us talk a lot about subscription plus cloud gaming and the opportunity for those two things to fundamentally disrupt the way people access and enjoy games like nothing before, much in the same way as it's disrupted enjoyment and engagement in movies and music. And so we've talked about a three to five-year time horizon. We believe that cloud gaming is going to make a meaningful contribution to the way players engage with games. And of course, what that does mean is it really doesn't matter what device you're accessing it by. The experience that you have is governed by the size of the screen and the amount of time you have to play And so everything we're building right now, we are thinking about a world where we will not be bound by device. We will not be bound by local compute or memory, but much of these experiences will exist in the cloud, and you'll access them based on whatever device you have access to at the time. And we think about that at a core technology level. We think about that at a game design level. We also think about that as how we think \u2013 how we interact with our players and how they interact with the games. And you should expect to see us between now and that time start to push more of our experiences, particularly ones with really large global communities, to be able to interact with experiences across devices. And you've already seen this from us with FIFA and the ability to access Ultimate Team and do a great deal of interactions with Ultimate Team through FUT mobile and on PC and on your console experience. And we look forward to driving more of that in the future. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So on the second question, you should assume that we'll see some phasing of R&D over the year as we start to build out our games \u2013 new games. We have better leverage, obviously, as revenue grows in the third and fourth quarter on that number, but you should see \u2013 in real terms, you'd see some slow growth of that during the year. We do tend to use more part-time employees during the third quarter as we're leading into large layout or large new titles. You can see that in the past P&Ls in terms of the phasing. G&A is pretty consistent year on year. And marketing, as you know, we're targeting around 12%. And so that's really dependent on titles and marketing that we're doing ahead of a quarter around a title. But obviously, our bigger quarters, you're going to see larger marketing spend both at the tail end of the second quarter and all through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Yes, hi, so thank you for taking my question. So Andrew just talked about the future of play and how the industry will evolve over the next few years, and Blake spoke about how the revenue stream is already looking more SaaS-like. So my question is, as we start to think about cloud gaming, what does the business model look like? Is it subscription, ads, full price? Is it microtransactions or DLC? And with this cloud gaming offering, is that a standalone EA offering, or would you offer your games on a third-party platform, maybe something analogous to the current console paradigm? I just want to hear your thoughts as you think about how this industry is evolving. Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes, great question. It's something that we've given a lot of thought to and plan towards. And again, if we look at other entertainment industries and other SaaS-like industries for guidance, what we discover is that multiple business models coexist. And if I think about how I consume movies right now, I have a Comcast subscription. I have a Netflix subscription. I buy things on iTunes that I watch on a plane, and I also watch a lot of free content through YouTube and other online mediums. But what we're also discovering is that even while those multiple business models exist, and our ideal here is to capture engagement and offer access through any business model on any device for all of our players in a growing global community, what we're seeing is a real move toward subscription as the best way to access content and the most frictionless way to access content and a way to build a relationship with a platform play who offers that collection of content wrapped in services. And so our expectation is while we will continue to offer the access to content through any and all business models that our players tell us they want to utilize, we expect that consumers, much the way they have in other industries, will move more towards subscription. And that will become a far more meaningful part of our business and maybe even the majority of our business in the years to come. And as we think about that, we're in a unique position to offer subscription as we're doing today by virtue of the breadth and depth of our content and our ability to get to a large global player base of diverse cohorts, diverse backgrounds and diverse geographies. We also understand and appreciate, however, that even with the size of the portfolio we have, there are other elements of gameplay that will be important to a broader subscriber base as we continue to grow. And what you're seeing from us now with what we're doing with our Originals program is bringing new content in. What you're seeing from us with signing third parties is bringing new and interesting and different content in. You might imagine that front-line content will become an important part of that in the future and that we might work collaboratively with other content creators and developers and publishers to ensure we have a truly robust subscription offering. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And a streaming approach allows \u2013 while that technology still is evolving and we know that it could be two to four years away, it allows for the concept that you could play games on many different devices versus on one device typically found in your home. And we may partner with people as well as work on our own technology to help deliver that. And as Andrew said, we think that can be delivered in many different ways. And still many years from now we'll have gaming across consoles, PCs, possibly streaming-enabled TVs, or other devices as well as mobile devices. And that's the exciting part about the business. We think that continues to help grow the market. It doesn't bifurcate the market in a negative way. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Blake, just looking at the guidance, if I did my math right, you're actually implying that units are down year on year within the initial guidance. So I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes there, given you have a favorable comp, one would think with Battlefield and Anthem obviously coming into the fray. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I'm not quite sure how you're doing the math to get to the units being down, but maybe you can give me the details on that offline. But we're saying \u2013 a couple things to note is you've got a whole bunch of pieces in the puzzle. That's why I don't know if you can do the math. Live service growth, remember, subscription growth is part of live services growth. And so in a subscription world, you actually may have or will have less units sold, but you'll have more consistent revenue over time. And we're expecting a few inflection points in our subscription programs this next year, which should help drive more growth. So that's why I come back to my statement earlier that said we're moving away from discussing units because it's either live service revenue or subscription revenue that you're going to tend to see growing over time, which neither of those will show up as units in any way. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just on Battlefield this year, could you maybe just give us a sense as to how your multiplayer approach for this game might differ from historical Battlefield games? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Again, we've got lots to talk about in the weeks and months to come, and you should imagine that we will be talking at great length about it. The DICE team has a core DNA, maybe the strongest in the industry, around multiplayer, and more importantly innovation in multiplayer. They were the first team to get to 64-player multiplayer. They were the first team to get to destruction in multiplayer. And so you should imagine that, as we talked about in the prepared notes, all the things that a Battlefield fan would expect out of a multiplayer game from DICE in the Battlefield universe will be there, while additional innovations in how we're thinking about the future of multiplayer in first-person shooters will also be there, both at launch and over time as part of a live service. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Watch closely in the hint. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: We certainly will be, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: More things to come. Operator : And your next question comes from Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great, thanks for taking my question. In thinking about the potential of your future subscription strategies, what percentage of customers repurchase titles like FIFA or Madden every year versus new customers coming in to purchase the title? And then similarly, how many people could be considered lapsed users that could come back in at a different price point or monetization strategy? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I don't have the exact numbers, but quite a few. Since Ultimate Team has gained scale, we're north of 70% with titles like FIFA and Madden. Pre-Ultimate Team, this goes back some time, it was oftentimes less than 50% bought every year. So you're seeing a much more consistent buying pattern because people want to reengage in Ultimate Team. People are \u2013 70-plus percent of the buyers are engaging in Ultimate Team, so you would expect to see that type of pattern. We do, though, spend a lot of time on how do we bring lapsed players back in and how do we maintain a consistent world with those players. And I think in that world, subscription will only help because they'll constantly be getting upgraded over time with their versions of the game. And I think that keeps people engaged, and most importantly keeps them involved in the live service components, which makes the game more fun for everybody. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC : That's great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Ross from BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thanks for taking the question. More on subscription, what do you think the timeline is for you to immediately add your own front-line releases such as a FIFA or a Battlefield or an Anthem to Access and Origin? And when you speak about there being an inflection point in subscription, are you alluding to that happening this year potentially? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: That's a good question. Go ahead, sorry. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : I was going to ask about capital allocation afterwards. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Okay, so I'm going to hit the first one and then you can ask it. We don't have anything to announce today, but I'd just say assume that our subscription strategy, as Andrew said, will be evolving quickly. I think that's this year and next year you start to see new things in that subscription program, be it new third-party titles, potentially at some point front-line titles. But clearly we'll continue to push that. We believe the platform can do all those things. We also want to add more social layers into the platform and more tools, and you'll continue to see that evolution going on as well through the Origin platform. So more to come, we're pretty excited. Don't take my inflection point comment too literally, but you should see continued growth and you'll probably see some spikes in growth as we add new and exciting things to the service. You've got a capital allocation... Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Yeah, on capital allocation, a couple things. I think you've been considering a dividend. Can you walk us through why you decided against that? And you mentioned leaving capital for potential opportunities. What are the ideal M&A opportunities for your organization at this point? Is it mobile or supplementing with studios and genres where you're weaker or on the technology side? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I'll hit that first. It's all three of those things. As Andrew mentioned, running a broad subscription service requires great content. And so we're always looking for great content and really great studios that can build that content. We partnered with Respawn for some time to get to know them. We believe they're a studio that can build not just the great games they're building today, but great games for a long time to come. And so it's a great studio and great partners that we can bring to the table in both mobile and console and PC, but also technology that will help us either in subscriptions or streaming, and you'll probably see some of that stuff to come. Most of it is probably more small to midsized than large just because there's not that many large companies out there, but we'll look at everything, and we want to maintain that flexibility. And that was really the primary reason for not doing a dividend is that we felt if we started a dividend it would be much harder to stop it if there was some reason to flex up to do something larger. And that's the reason we decided to stay with the buyback. We feel it's the most efficient way to do it and it gives you full flexibility going forward. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great, thanks, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thank you, a couple questions. First, your live services up 31% in what could be a big Fortnite quarter. How did you factor in that competition and then the holiday competition in your guidance? And then the second thing, Overwatch League is up and running, NBA starting this month. What have you learned from esports? And would you say you're more optimistic on the opportunity or about the same? Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yes, so let me do the Fortnite piece, and then I'll let Andrew talk about esports. We welcome innovation in the industry. That's what makes this business so exciting and fun to operate in. If you look back over the 20 or 30 years, the innovation that one game team has done has been going through the whole industry. It's fantastic, and we welcome innovators like Fortnite or PUBG that really help push everyone's thinking. And we feel that that's great for the business as a whole. We don't feel like any one player or any one game, from FIFA to Madden to Battlefield, is going to capture that 100% of the marketplace. It just doesn't happen that way. And so we haven't seen a giant impact, but it's guessing around what our forecast was. We try to be conservative. We try to anticipate as we do with either new titles coming out or existing titles or even things we don't know about. But we do think in the case of Fortnite, it's helped grow the whole marketplace. And in particular, it's bringing younger people into the marketplace and younger people into first-person shooters. And I think that's good for the long-run health of that category for all of us in the industry, not just one player. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And in terms of esports, we talked about this a little bit last quarter. We saw tremendous engagement in both our Madden league and our FIFA league up significantly year over year and breaking records in both broadcast television and on digital channels. We're going to continue to double down there. We've got an entire competitive gaming group that are pushing to grow that and really think about the ongoing evolution. We're excited and energized by the level of inbound queries and questions and requests for involvement that we've had. Again, we have the world's biggest game and this country's biggest game in soccer and American football, and there are a lot of people that really want to engage with that in order to get access to the audience that's really playing and watching our esports events there. Also in the prepared remarks, we talked about ongoing investment in Battlefield. Again, Battlefield has multiplayer and competition core to its DNA. And we're excited about what the DICE team is doing and innovating as it relates to competitive play in and around Battlefield. And we've got another one that we're launching later this year too that we've yet to announce. So I think the macro message you're hearing from us is that we always believe this would grow engagement and grow revenue. It's happening much quicker than we anticipated, and we're doubling down to make sure that we maintain that momentum and continue to grow engagement both from players, viewers, and sponsors and broadcasters in and around our events. Justin Post - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Justin, one more question? Operator : Your last question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Andrew, I think given what I think you and Blake have alluded to in the past with the expected timeline for the ramp of FIFA mobile and how long it took Madden mobile to ramp, I was a little bit surprised to see Tencent recently announce the game for China. So I'm wondering if it's a different or the same version of the game and how your thinking may have evolved in terms of catching up to Madden mobile monetization. And also, I think you called out the launch of FIFA Online 4 with Nexon and Tencent in your prepared remarks. Can you provide us with an update on your efforts to I guess migrate the users from FIFA Online 3 to 4? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Wow, there were a lot of questions there. So first is FIFA in the West, you heard in the prepared remarks, continues to grow and certainly contributed to the growth in our FIFA business this year, even in the face of some of our older titles in decline, as they would have expected to be at this timeline. We're excited about what that team is doing and expect that that will continue to do very well and grow this year. Particularly in a World Cup year, you should imagine that there will be a series of events and opportunities for mobile players to engage in that. We also have a game in China that we're doing with Tencent in and around FIFA Online 4 that is a Chinese-specific execution, and we're excited about that. And then we are actively transitioning across to FIFA Online 4 in both Korea and China. And that is going as well as we planned, and it's certainly getting the full support of Nexon in Korea and six-star marketing support in China. And so all in all, we're very, very happy with our performance in mobile and free-to-play in Korea and China and in the West. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great. With that, we'll call it and see everyone, if not at E3, in the near future. Thanks very much for your time today. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you, Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Erica. Welcome to EA's first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, a transcript, and an updated FAQ. With regards to our calendar, our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be on Thursday, August 2, here in Redwood Shores; and our Q2 fiscal 2019 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, October 30. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, July 26, 2018 and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now that our Q1 results reflect our adoption of ASC 606, this does not materially impact our net bookings metric, but does change our GAAP reporting in several ways. Prior periods have not been restated. For more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we've posted on our IR website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. We've had a strong start to FY2019. We continue to expand our network with creative new games, launched a new mobile game on the WeChat platform, and had deeply engaged communities in our live services. Revenue and earnings for Q1 were above our guidance, and we are looking forward to bringing more new experiences to our players throughout this fiscal year. Our strategy continues to center on delivering a collection of amazing games and content wrapped in services with more ways to play, watch, share ,create and connect that enable us to grow our global audience. Among our top titles, EA SPORTS FIFA continues to demonstrate unique ability to engage more than 100 million players across geographies, platforms and generations. During the quarter, we launched our World Cup content update for FIFA 18, and engagement was very strong with more than 15 million unique players on PC and console alone joining into playing. In addition, we launched FIFA Mobile in China this quarter, including real-time PvP, culturalized live service design, and enhanced social features. It's still early days, but this has quickly become our strongest ever launch in the Chinese market, reaching number one on the top downloads chart for iOS in China and showing best-in-class engagement on the WeChat platform. We have momentum across all platforms for our FIFA franchise, as we have just launched our latest season update in FIFA Mobile and FIFA 19, including the Champions League arrives later this quarter. From existing titles to unique new experiences, we introduced amazing content to our network throughout Q1. Our Sims 4 community grew 35% in unique players year-over-year as we continue to deliver new content packs and updates as part of our ongoing live service. With the breadth, depth and size of the Sims audience on mobile, we're now fulfilling different motivations across two distinct games, giving fans and newcomers alike more of what they love about the franchise. In another dimension of our portfolio, our EA Originals and EA Partners programs are helping indie developers reach a global audience. More than 2.6 million players experienced the cult hit A Way Out from Hazelight through Q1. And we also launched Unravel 2, another beautiful game from Coldwood. As we strive to deliver experiences that amaze and inspire players around the world, we are continually expanding EA's portfolio. EA PLAY, our three-day event in early June, was a great success. Fans that joined us in Hollywood were able to go hands-on with demos and other experiences for a dozen different games, including Anthem, Battlefield V, the EA SPORTS portfolio, Command & Conquer Rivals, and more. Across the globe, fans viewed the trailers and player-generated content of our games released at EA PLAY more than 165 million times. Media and critics were also excited by what they played, with our games receiving more than 60 awards, including Best of Awards from E3 Game Critics for Anthem, Battlefield V, and FIFA 19. Beginning in late June and into early July, we conducted our first public Alpha test for Battlefield V. The results exceeded our expectations, with high demand leading to three times our planned number of participants joining the test. Feedback was highly positive, with players able to truly feel the advancement that DICE has been focused on in the game play. This type of early play opportunity is now foundational to our development process as a great way to engage the community and enable them to provide input we can build on as we move through development. We are planning more hands-on opportunities with Battlefield V prior to launch. We're also pleased with the excitement that is building for Anthem, our new IP set to launch in February. Our EA PLAY demo sessions for Anthem were packed from beginning to end, and we're continuing to see great interest and anticipation from fans wanting to learn more. BioWare is building incredible depth and gameplay innovation into this new shared world experience, and we look forward to sharing much more with our players in the months ahead, including pre-launch opportunities to jump into the game. As we move further into FY 2019, we are continuing to push the boundaries and pioneer for our players. Origin Access Premier launches next week, a first-of-its kind subscription service that will include unlimited access to our newest PC titles. We believe strongly in the transformative nature of subscriptions. In a network where subscriptions can reduce friction and help give players ready access to more great content, we are enabling developers from EA and beyond to bring truly amazing and immersive new experiences to a global audience. We're developing more new IP and bringing new teams to EA that can deliver more new and unique experiences. And we're continuing to work with more of the best creators across the industry to add more third-party games to our subscription services. In Q2, we will also launch new EA SPORTS titles on console and PC, major content and gameplay updates to our EA SPORTS mobile games, and continued updates to FIFA Online 4. In Competitive Gaming, our franchise are uniquely fulfilling the tremendous demand, widespread appeal, and longevity of traditional sports in the context of esports. Next week is the FIFA eWorld Cup Grand Final, the pinnacle of this year's competitive FIFA season that has seen participation from more than 20 million players from 60 countries and 80% more average viewers so far over last season. Our next season of Madden NFL competitive gaming also kicks off this quarter, with the second year of the 32-team Madden NFL Club Championship and broadcasts set for the ESPN network. We are continuing to evolve and grow our competitive leagues and programs at an accelerated pace. With every game, every service and every experience, we are continuing to take steps towards our vision to connect a billion people in playing. We look forward to sharing more updates in the quarters to come. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. We started another years strongly, with a first quarter beat on net bookings and on profitability. We continued to deliver on our growth strategies, with a focus on new genres, on China, and on building new live services. This quarter, at EA PLAY, we announced significant progress across all three vectors. We gave players a deep look at Anthem, our upcoming action game. We launched FIFA Mobile on the WeChat platform in China. And we announced Origin Access Premier, a new subscription service that will include access to EA games from the day of launch or earlier. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tab in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.14 billion, compared to $1.45 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $57 million. Operating expenses were $622 million compared to $552 million a year ago primarily driven by new product development as we continue to invest in new IP. Operating income was $300 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.95, $0.31 above our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $120 million, down $56 million from last year driven by additional investments in R&D, the timing of cash received and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $32 million resulting in a free cash flow of $88 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides for more cash flow information. During the quarter we also repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $300 million leaving 2.2 billion available on our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $749 million, down $26 million from the prior year but $29 million above our guidance. The outperformance relative to guidance was driven by FIFA Online 3, A Way Out, and Battlefield 1. The year-on-year delta was driven by the Mass Effect : Andromeda sales captured in the year-ago quarter partially offset by FIFA Online 4, The Sims 4, and A Way Out. Digital net bookings were $693 million up $12 million on the year ago period. The increase was driven by FIFA Online 4, The Sims 4, and A Way Out, partially offset by Mass Effect Andromeda. On the trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 69% of our business compared to 63% a year ago. Looking at the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn, Live service net bookings were up 7% year-on-year to $450 million. This growth was driven by FIFA Online 4 and The Sims 4 as we looked to broaden the base of recurring revenue. Millions of people played FIFA 18 as a result of the World Cup mode in FIFA Ultimate Team. Engagements were up, players were up, but ARPU was lower than we'd expected due to the World Cup mode focus on acquiring new players. Sales of the base game rose above our expectations and we had the highest daily active users in the game's history. We're pleased that it was so successful at both bringing back lapsed players and introducing new players to the FIFA game as the Ultimate Team. And this positions the franchise very well as we prepare to launch FIFA 19 and look to the European leagues kicking off. Both EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow. We reached a significant milestone in our subscription strategy next week on July 30 when we launch Origin Access Premier. We look forward to discussing its performance as we add frontline titles to the subscription. Mobile delivered net bookings of $147 million, down 2% year-on-year due to slight declines in older titles, partially offset by the ramp of FIFA Mobile in Asia. Monetization in The Sims Mobile has started slowly, consistent with prior Sims launches, and the team continues to grow the game by adding exciting new careers, activities, events, and other attractive new content based on feedback from our community of millions of Sims fans. We are encouraged by the performance of FIFA Mobile on the WeChat platform in China. It's still early days but the game delivered one of the highest grossing days ever for any of our mobile titles and hit number one in the IOS download charts. We work very closely with Tencent to bring it to market and we're taking our learnings from this into FIFA Mobile worldwide. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $96 million, 14% lower than last year due to the Mass Effect : Andromeda sales captured in the year-ago quarter. 40% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, up from 34% a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full year despite the strengthening of the dollar since last quarter. At the time, exchange rates were $100 million tailwind relative to the prior year. At today's exchange rates, that has returned to zero suggesting $100 million headwind to our net bookings guidance. However, our current guidance assumes this headwind will be offset by general weakening of the dollar through the remainder of the year or improved bookings from our business. It should also be noted that there is less risk to the bottom-line because of our hedging strategy. We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.82 billion with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and so free cash flow would be about $1.7 billion. For the second quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.27 billion, cost of revenue to be $436 million and operating expenses of $674 million. OpEx is up 10% driven by the continued investments in our growth strategies. This results in earnings per share of $0.48 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.16 billion. This is down slightly year-on-year driven by the strength of our Battlefield 1 sales in the prior year and the timing of the recognition of bookings in Asia, as well as FX. We're pleased with how we started the year, the progress we are making on our growth strategies, and the continued growth of our recurring revenue, and there's a lot to look forward to in the coming months. We'll launch Madden NFL 19 in August and FIFA 19 at the end of September. Battlefield V is coming in October, and all three will be available on Origin Access Premier several days ahead of their launches. Incidentally, this is the first time in over a decade we're making Madden available on PC. FIFA Online 4 continues to ramp in Asia as does FIFA Mobile. And we are continuing to build excitement for Anthem ahead of its launch in February. In esports, as Andrew mentioned, we will be concluding the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series with the final in London next week, and we have a full schedule of events coming up for FIFA, Madden, and more. Looking further into the future, we continue our pioneering work in cloud gaming and other advanced technologies. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. This is an amazing time to be making games and entertainment. As we saw last month at EA PLAY and E3, the energy and creativity that defines this industry continues to reach new heights. Innovation is enabling us to break through barriers to expand the accessibility of games and grow an audience in the billions. Through more ways to play, create, compete, watch, and share, the thread of social connection that is unique to games is becoming even stronger and bringing players deeper into global communities. The digital transformation to take games from finite to infinite experiences, and each day our opportunity at EA is to turn incredible ideas into entertainment that will inspire the world to play. In this world, creativity moves quickly and we constantly keep focus on our players. New IP and fresh new experiences are our lifeblood. In addition to amazing games coming this year like Battlefield V, Anthem, our latest EA SPORTS titles and Command & Conquer rivals, we have new IP development for all platforms. Across EA Worldwide Studios, Respawn is developing Star Wars : Jedi Fallen Order for FY 2020 along with another new project in the pipeline. Motive is developing new IP. Our mobile studios are working on several new titles, and we have more projects under way. At the foundation of every experience will be choice, fairness, value, and fun that ensure we are delivering for our broad and diverse player audience. We are also pushing, I think, farther as the expansion and transformation of games continues. Subscriptions will bring more choice, reduce friction, and add value in a world of ever increasing content. And with Origin Access Premier, we are breaking new ground for the industry. Esports is bringing massive audience into the excitement of competitive gaming, and through our leading IP we have global momentum that we will continue to expand with new competitions, new broadcasts, and more partners. Technology like cloud gaming, advanced AI, and machine learnings will change the way that games are made and played. We are continuing to invest in these areas of the core of our Player Network to connect players around the world to the best entertainment and to each other. We're excited for the future as we seek to amaze our players and continue leading the growth and transformation of this great industry. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Unknown Speaker : Hi. It's Matt Costa (18:54) on for Brian. Thanks for taking our questions. I have a few. First is how large of a contributor was Ultimate Team to live services in the quarter? And connected to that, how are you thinking about the impact of Fortnite and trends with younger and female players? And then the second is what are you seeing as the biggest areas of dollar investment this year and into next year obviously between new IP subscriptions, et cetera? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. We \u2013 thanks, Brian, yeah, thank you. We typically don't break out Ultimate Team on a quarterly basis, but you should assume that Ultimate Team is over 50% of the live services component in any one quarter and certainly in the quarter that we just closed out. And I'm going to let Andrew take a crack at the Fortnite question if you'd like to do that. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure. So what we have seen is that Fortnite continues to what we believe expand the audience. We saw incredible engagement in our games for the quarter. As we talked about, we had over 15 million people join our World Cup mode in FIFA. And so our expectation is that as they continued to expand the audience that provides tremendous opportunity for us going into the holiday season, particularly as we think about launching Madden and FIFA and Battlefield into what is a growing player audience. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing that I would add to that is without a doubt it's been a phenomenon in the industry, and I'm sure it's taken up people's time. We had a hard time pointing to exactly where that's impacted our business, but I'm sure it is taking up people's time across the industry. But we also know that that means more and more people are brought in to play games and will enjoy games in the future, in particular first-person shooter games down the road. Can you repeat your second part of your question? I'm sorry I didn't write it down. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. No problem. So how are you thinking about the biggest areas of dollar investment this year and the next year between new IP subscriptions streaming? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the bulk of it's driven around new IP. That's where the biggest dollar spend has been going, i.e., building new studios and bringing in new people to help build new IP. That feeds ultimately the subscription business with more content. We are looking for extra content outside of our own IP, i.e., things like the Warner Bros. content that we bring in. And most of that content is based on \u2013 the expenses are based on how much it's used inside of the subscription. So that's more variable in some respects. And then underlying that is all of our network infrastructure including security which continues to be an important part of our spend base. And while it's not as big as our new IP development, it's just critical to how we operate as a networked company now and in the future. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: The one piece I would add to that is that in terms of our digital platform, we've had a meaningfully sized team working on that over the last five years on ID, commerce, infrastructure, data security. And as they have continued to build on that platform, in addition to what is increased investment, we're also reprioritizing those resources against some things like subscription like cloud gaming, like AI, like machine learning. And so while it doesn't show up as an incremental investment, by virtue of having completed a number of the broader foundational technical issues in the area of ID, and commerce, and data, we're able to now repurpose that talent against some of these new strategic opportunities. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. First for the mobile business I think net bookings were down only slightly year-on-year but you had a very successful launch of FIFA Mobile in China during the quarter. Can you just help us understand the impact of that title in the quarter, how it performed relative to your expectations, and how you're thinking about it contributing for the rest of the year in the context of your guidance? And then just secondly, I know it's still very early days. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you've noticed from the early adopters of the Origin frontline subscription. Are you finding that they're playing more of your games? Are they spending more in those games? Just curious how that's been progressing. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. Let me hit that first because that one's easy. We don't know yet because it doesn't get turned on until next week. We do know though from our EA Access experience and our Origin Access experience for non-frontline titles that we find people play twice as many games for twice as long and spend twice as much money as they did outside or before they joined the subscription. And that's what led us to believe that frontline titles would be also very advantageous to the subscription, as well as help drive new users into the system. So we'll have more to say over that over the next couple of months. I think remember we've got Madden going in in August, FIFA in September, Battlefield in October, and then Anthem in February. Those are the four PC-based titles that will go into Origin Access Premier. And we really won't have a full sense of that until after all four of those titles are in but we'll try and give people updates along the way to the extent that they're meaningful and new information. In terms of FIFA Mobile, we're incredibly excited but it's still early days. The impact to the quarter was certainly above what our guidance was but not a large number because it is still early in that rollout. But clearly, as we stated, both the size of some of the days we saw and the chart positions we saw, and probably most importantly, the feedback we're getting from the consumer as well as our partner, Tencent, all implies that we've got a very exciting future for FIFA Mobile. But I would caution everyone to be careful. We've built that into our guidance for the year. We believe that it's going to be a strong contributor longer term. But as you've seen with FIFA Mobile around the globe, it takes time to build these and tune these models to get them exact. So they really outperform what we've just seen historically. So more to come on that but early days are very exciting on it. Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess, first, when you think about the fiscal 2020 slate. You talked a little bit about the Respawn Jedi title releasing that year. Just curious, is there any room between Respawn and the sports portfolio. Is there any room for another major release or should we kind of block that out to fiscal 2021? And then secondly, just coming back to Origin Access Premier, obviously at EA PLAY and E3, a lot of conversations were around subscription, streaming, and consolidation. I'm just curious what the conversations have been like coming out of those events since you announced Origin Access Premier just in terms of conversations with the other publishers and just industry chatter. Any color there would be helpful. Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So be careful that you don't take 2020 to be literal, as Andrew described it, because we're not giving guidance on 2020 yet. And I think Andrew did say there are other things coming. So more to come on that. We don't like to give everything up in the first quarter of this year. We got to deliver this year first. But trust that there's most likely other sizable titles -- one or two other sizable titles coming. And we'll see as we give guidance and we'll give some more color on that as we get into later this year before we ultimately give guidance at the start of next year. I don't know if you want to touch on subscription, Andrew? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, again coming out of EA PLAY, there was a lot of conversation on Origin Access Premier. And certainly from a gamer standpoint, the feedback was very, very positive in terms of the opportunity to access more great games at great value with reduced friction. And we expect that that will be a big plus for gamers over time. And like subscription businesses, it will take time to build, but we believe in the long-term potential of that as we have seen to be true \u2013 with linear based media like TV, movies, and music. In terms of the conversation we've had with other developers and publishers, I would say that the feedback is mixed. I think we are in a unique position by virtue of the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the many, many, many hundreds of hours of gameplay that we can offer with our own portfolio to take this step forward for the industry, and we do believe we're leading and pioneering for the industry. Some developers and publishers that we have spoken to are very, very excited about the opportunity to access this highly engaged player base that will deliver tremendous lifetime engagement into this live service. And other developers and publishers, I would say, are in a wait-and-see approach. As I've said before, I think the greatest disruption of the consumption of entertainment media, in the last five years of the combination of streaming plus subscription, we're starting with subscription and we're leading from there, and we're investing in streaming over the long term. And my sense is that as we're able to grow the TAM as a result of this, engage players for longer with greater value at lower friction that we'll see continued uptake and participation in services like this. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question, Erica. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I guess, you guys significantly outperformed your earnings guidance for this quarter, but I believe the outlook for the full year remains unchanged. Now I know that there's a lot still to come, so I appreciate the conservatism. But it'd be great if you guys could just confirm especially whether or not your outlook for any titles has come down and since you guided back in May specifically for Battlefield, Anthem and for Ultimate Team, and I have one follow-up. Unknown Speaker : Sure. So I think you've been around for a while, Ryan. I think once in the last five years we've raised guidance coming out of first quarter. First quarter is 15% of our business and you know our conservative approach, so we tend not to do that. We have not changed our outlook on titles. I would say the caution is what I mentioned on FX. We came into the quarter and gave guidance thinking we finally have a tailwind on FX. And due to, I believe, much of the trade war chatter and maybe further chatter on Brexit, we've seen a dramatic change in both the pound and the euro, as well as the other underlying currencies, and that's created a headwind for us versus a tailwind. Now I think we're not changing our guidance because we're not certain how long that will last. But it's the overall view on the market versus a fundamental view on any specific title or business. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Makes sense. And then I guess live services was up 7% during the quarter, and I believe you guided to 10% to 15% for the full year. So it would be great if you could help us kind of bridge those two growth rates together. Maybe what are the puts and takes for fiscal 2Q? And then as you get out into the holidays, it's going to drive that reacceleration in the back half, whether it's going to come from live services like subscriptions in Origin, maybe Ultimate Team or Battlefield, if you can rank order those, that'd be great. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's probably all of those. It's hard for me to rank order because we tend not to give individual live service forecasts. You should \u2013 I think you all know, but start of the sports season is the real peak of live services for sports, the first two quarters coming out for both FIFA and Madden and hockey as well and NBA for that matter. And so you tend to see that as the products are rolled out. The first quarter tends to be the slowest quarter. We actually had a lot of engagement, as Andrew mentioned and as I mentioned on the call, but less monetization just because the design of World Cup. And remember, only about half of World Cup was in the quarter versus half in the second quarter. So we're still sticking. We don't change our guidance by sector, but I would say we're still comfortable with the guidance that we've provided on live services and we're very excited about where it's going particularly that driven by esports, as well as new live services that we'll start to roll out on new products as we bring them to market. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on that and following up again on the commentary from your prepared remarks, on live services, it was interesting to hear that you can also use it as a mechanism for user acquisition, driving user engagement. Can you give us some color on how you think about either turning the knob on monetization versus turning the dial on engagement and user growth through live services as opposed to just going purely from monetization against time spent? Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. I think it's a great question. And certainly the nature of live services is transformative to our business and transforming how we think about acquisition engagement of players over time. And certainly, we think a lot about the lifetime value of a player and the lifetime engagement of that player versus simply a point-to-point transaction or a point-to-point unit sale. And as we looked at World Cup and we went back and we looked at many of the previous World Cups, and I've been working on that business since 2006, what we came to understand was that typically it was an opportunity to bring in a lot of new players and introduce a lot of new players through the spectacle and pageantry of the World Cup to the world of soccer and the world of interactive soccer through FIFA. And as we designed the mode this time around, we certainly had that in mind and had been highly successful, I would say, in acquiring and reacquiring less players as part of that engagement. What that meant through the process was that we had lower monetization than we might do typically as part of FIFA Ultimate Team, but we knew it was an opportunity to bring in a whole new group of players into FIFA more broadly and work with them over the many, many years to come as they continue to play the game. And what I can say is certainly coming out of the World Cup we have seen our core players, as well as millions of our newly acquired players move back into the core FIFA Ultimate Team experience, and we're excited about launching a new game later for them this year and introducing them two new aspects of Ultimate Team certainly as those include Champions League content. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong Q1 for you. Just two little ones here. Curious if you had any potential VR monies from Battlefield V in your guidance in fiscal 2019. I have a quick follow-up. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Did you mean that are we planning a VR experience for Battlefield? Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: No. I was referring to Battle Royale. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think we talked with E3 about bringing out Battle Royale mode for Battlefield. We haven't announced exactly when that will come out, but we did say that we would have one. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And it seems like Battlefield V, you've created a fairly full value proposition, single player, all the multiplayer aspects that a franchise player want. And now you're adding the Battle Royale mode which obviously is a new addition. Just curious, when you think about, I guess, how strong these Battle Royale games are in terms of creating player communities or basically expanding TAM which you've talked about before, they're often monetizing and, of course, you have a couple of really strong incumbents with Fortnite and PUBG. So how do you think about, I guess, a tethered free-to-play Battle Royale which appears to be what you're going to do with Battlefield V versus a stand-alone offering at a reduced price perhaps similar to a PUBG or a free-to-play offering similar to Fortnite, we could sort of maximize the TAM and monetization. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, right now we're focused on \u2013 for Battlefield, we're focused on creating as a mode in the game. No different than the other modes that we have in the game. We may have lots of other things that come out over time for Battlefield. I think we're really focused on how do we continually build live services around all of our games. And you'll see some of that for Battlefield in the comings months and once the game is released. I would say we're interested in possibly experimenting with a essentially free-to-play standalone game that might be in a shooter genre or another genre, but I don't think that's how we're looking at the Battlefield stuff right now. But you'll see more to come on that in the coming months and years. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And what I would say about our Battlefield community is it's growing and diverse community who are looking for many different ways to play the game, and that might be through single player, that might be through traditional multiplayer modes or that might be through what we discussed in a newly developed Battle Royale mode. There are also other new modes that we're developing, again DICE is one of our most innovative studios. We're continuing to build and look to deliver innovative multiplayer components to that game. And as we come into October, we'll be talking more about this, but you should expect that we'll be delivering a full featured game that features all of the traditional components of a Battlefield game in addition to new modalities of play including Battle Royale and delivered in a way that we believe we want to play which is not just what you get at launch but in the context of a live service over time. And we're excited about what we're able to do there. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Thatcher from Macquarie. Ed Alter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. This Ed Alter on for Ben. Can you discuss how the commission rate paid to platform holders differ across mobile consoles and particularly China? And if there's any opportunities you see that you can leverage or scale to improve those rates over time? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We don't disclose that but I think people will have a pretty good sense of what the rates are for Apple and Google and Tencent. And it's a different model within Sony and Microsoft but effectively similar levels across all the western ones. The Chinese Eastern, Tencent and others are different, but I think most people have a perspective on that. So... Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, thanks. So, Blake, I know it's early, but can you talk about the differences between the FIFA Mobile game that's available in China versus what's available everywhere else? In terms of how monetization in China might be better or worse different, presumably ARPU might be lower versus the Western markets. So wondering if the conversion rate to paying users is materially different? Also, can you help us think about the impact for the Champions League to the guidance parameters? Is this purely going to be just more events around the midweek games or are there different modes that you're planning, et cetera? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So why don't I take the first part and then I'll let Andrew do the Champions League piece. It's early days and so I'm going to hold off on giving you any general statistics. But I would say in terms of how the game is different, it's much more localized than we've done in other markets. And part of that is just the uniqueness of the Chinese market and the uniqueness of the fact that many people in China don't yet know all of the intricacies in play or in rules of football. And so part of what we did is try to make the game much more understandable and much more Chinese-centric around how games are sometimes played. It had local content as well, which FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Online 3 do in their respective markets. And so I would say the biggest driver has been localization. But it's still too early to start sort of understanding what all of the metrics are going to be. We'll think about how we can describe that as we get a better sense of it without getting down the path of dealing with individual game metrics, which will probably drive you guys crazy. But I think, all in all, the localization component that ourselves, our teams in Asia and Tencent helped on has been a huge benefit for that marketplace versus where we've been tuning internationally with a base game that we have from the West. This is a much more depth in localization that we've seen in other markets. And we did that because the opportunity and the size of the potential there is so large. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And in terms of Champions League, for many who follow the sport Champions League, maybe the most popular and powerful soccer league, if not sports league, in the world, bringing together the best clubs in Europe and the best footballers in what is a magnificent tournament. And so, you should expected us \u2013 I talked about in the prepared remarks, we have over 100 million players across platforms and games and generations in FIFA. And you should expect that we are thinking about how we can enhance and extend all of those experiences with Champions League content. That might be something as simple as what we've done in FIFA console this year and doing a completely new and progressive remix of the Champions League theme song all the way through the manifestations in story mode and general single player, multiplayer modes, all the way through into Ultimate Team and live service events over time. We're really excited about the inclusion of the Champions League. It's the first time we've had it, I think, in over a decade. And we believe our fan base, given the popularity of that league, again will also be very excited with how the team has delivered an interactive experience across various platforms and games. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And as you know, Ultimate Team is driven by the weekly events that we host. And obviously the Champions League gives us a whole new opportunity for new events to be able to add to that roster. So, that's very exciting for us. And we think this is not just a one-year play. This is something that will continue to help evolve FIFA over time. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good afternoon. I just want to clarify. I thought I heard Andrew say that FIFA had 100 million players. Is that accurate or is that the total EA SPORTS franchise? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: No, that's accurate. So, when you think about \u2013 a lot of the times when we talked about FIFA, we talk about FIFA in the context of console in the West, and certainly being placed in the West. It's easy to think about FIFA in that context. But remember also, we're on FIFA Mobile in the West and in Asia. We have a very, very successful PC free-to-play online game in Korea, Southeast Asia and China. And as we look across the entire platform, we thought it was important that we start to think about FIFA in its true capacity across the franchise, and it's over 100 million players. Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Good afternoon. Blake, I'll preface this by saying, I'm not complaining. You purchased $300 million worth of stock in the quarter. You generated about $90 million of free cash flow. So, I mean, you didn't really dip \u2013 didn't have to dip into your existing cash at all. At this point, what are you thinking about what it would take to maybe accelerate the buyback a little bit? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We're only one quarter into our two-year $2.4 billion buyback and I'm already getting requests to move it up. No surprise. I appreciate that you prefaced it by saying you weren't complaining. We've always focused on trying to have a systematic program, not an opportunistic program, to consistently return capital to shareholders. We target that with our board every year. We've revised it every year and increased it every year. We just brought \u2013 started this new program, which is a doubling of our old program. And our view is we'll take that through the year, see how that performs, and revisit it at the end of the year, and decide if we should continue to buy back more stock or not. We're always trying to balance the need for cash for potential M&A activities or investments versus returning that cash to shareholders. We think the balance that we've hit now is about right. But we're always adjusting and thinking about that to make sure we are at a minimum covering dilution from share-based compensation. And our hope is that we will clearly do more than that in the coming years based on the level that we're at today. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : So, along those lines, I mean, you guys have made two seemingly small acquisitions. One, could you give us a little bit of detail on those two companies that you've acquired? And secondly, are you starting to see a little bit more movement in the M&A environment? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Unfortunately, we're not seeing a lot of movement because I think the industry is \u2013 everyone's doing so well, no one's really forced to try to rethink their direction, and staying in most cases in either a private position or as a standalone public company. That may change over time, and we're always watching that. We look at every major deal that comes through, and we have a team of people that are out in the marketplace all the time looking at players. The two acquisitions we did, you're correct, they're very small. The acquisition of the streaming assets from GameFly was a unique opportunity for us to buy technology that was essentially the middleware in streaming, and we believe it's critical to be able to stream to many different devices over time. And that's a team of people based in Tel Aviv, Israel and they're fabulous at what they do, and it was an opportunity to buy that team and the technology that they've developed, but it was less than $50 million. And then, the second piece is a very small mobile business that we've actually been working with, called Industrial Toys. I've talked to a few people that thought we were getting into the toy business, so we're clearly not getting in the toy business, so don't panic. But it's a group of people, one of the original founders of the Halo series. And they've been working for us on a mobile product that \u2013 as a work-for-hire studio. And we've been very impressed with that team, and with the quality of the people and their ideas of the things they're working on. I won't yet tell you what they're working on, but you will see something in the next couple of years coming out of that studio, we think is pretty innovative in the mobile space. So, we're very excited. We look at a lot of mobile businesses like that for great talent and great opportunity versus buying a specific product per se. And we knew those people well because we've been partnering with them. And so those are the types of things that we'll be constantly doing but, unfortunately, most of those are fairly small and longer term in vision. But we want to make sure we keep enough dry powder in case something does change. And if we find that there aren't really any opportunities, once again we'll go back and revisit the return to shareholders plan. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel, Nicolaus. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, wondered if you'd be willing to size the annual net bookings run rate for FIFA Online 4. I think in the past you've provided some context around the size of FIFA Online. And then, separately, one of the popular features in Fortnite has been cross-platform playability. Is that something you intend to include in Battlefield V or any other EA games? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure. I think FIFA Online, we've talked about both the growth particularly in China as well as the success in Korea. And it's still too early to size what FIFA Online 4 looks like. Right now, it's tracking very similar to FIFA Online 3. And there's always a transition period because you need to tell the consumers there that their currency doesn't translate across the two programs. And in a few markets, we're actually running both simultaneously to allow people to move off slowly versus immediately ship them on. So, trust that it's still small and relative to our 5.5 billion or 5.55 billion guidance, but growing very fast, particularly in China. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of cross-platform play, again we are seeing the same thing. And remember, we have a vision on a 3- to 5-year time horizon where a great portion of game experience will exist in the cloud and be pushed to every device you own. And the game experience you have won't be measured by local CPU or GPU but will be measured by screen size and session time you have, and will drive tremendous liquidity in the market \u2013 in a player base. And I think we are to deliver very different types of experiences as a result of a cloud gaming offering. In the near term, you should also appreciate that we're looking at key franchises in terms of how we could deliver cross-platform players in a similar way that Fortnite has, especially some of the titles have a broad and diverse player base. Households typically have one console, so the ability to bring PC to console and console to mobile into that play experience can bring families together, can bring friends together. And we think it's an important part of our future development profile both in terms of mobile games that we have today moving up per se to console and PC, and console and PC games being playable in mobile. And so, I expect more from us on that front in the future. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So, Andrew, you talked about connecting a billion people a day. So, my question is, how does your cloud-based gaming, the streaming service, how does this contribute to expanding your addressable market and eventually connecting a billion people? And then, just a follow-up on FIFA Mobile. Obviously, great success in China. Just wondering how that success might impact on your thinking about the opportunity that you do see in China over time and is it reasonable that we might expect to see more of this type of launches going forward. Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Great question. And typically my verbiage is a billion people in play versus a billion people a day. But I guess that's the very next step beyond getting them to play with us is getting to do it every day. And you should expect that that would be our objective upon reaching a billion people in play. Certainly, we believe that cloud gaming delivers a tremendous opportunity to do that. So, right now, depending on which figures you look at, but there's probably somewhere between 2 billion and 3 billion people playing games on mobile devices. So, discrete experiences, they're playing for a couple of minutes a day; and where the core part of that population are playing games like Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes for 90 minutes a day. Our belief is that, over time, that player base will continue to mature. We're seeing some of that with Fortnite right now, where we're seeing mobile players move up to a PC or a console in terms of the immersiveness and complexity of that experience. And you get co-players on big screen HD games to come down and spend more time on mobile devices. So, as we think about cloud more broadly, it's about capturing more of that TAM, so expanding the TAM across our portfolio, delivering that \u2013 delivering greater access to games, a tremendous value to our players with far lower friction. And for us, that's going to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Electronic Arts in the future. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of FIFA Mobile, clearly both ourselves and Tencent have been very pleased with the progress of the title, particularly a sports titles because there are not many sports titles in the marketplace. Also, you can imagine that we're having discussions with them on what other titles we might be able to put into the market. We have worked with them for some time, and worked with them obviously on FIFA Online on the free-to-play PC game. And so we're looking at other of our mobile franchises that might work in the marketplace if they were culturalized or localized in some fashion. We're very focused on continuing to try to grow that business and grow our partnerships with both Tencent and other players there to try to build that footprint. We think it's one of the biggest growth market opportunities for us around the world, and you'll see more products in the coming years, I think. I think, right now, the focus is on FIFA because it's still early, but we do think there's opportunity beyond FIFA. For example, our Need for Speed franchise has always been very popular there. The Plants vs. Zombies franchise, the Sims franchise have all been popular in China. And if there's ways to leverage what we're doing across those franchises, we'll certainly look at that. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: We also believe that, as we think about subscription, subscription is a relatively nascent business model in Asia right now. More broadly, I guess, more free-to-play model there. But what we are seeing is a rise of premium game engagement. And we also believe that as we think about Origin Access Premier and we think about the portfolio of games that we have that may traditionally not have had an audience by virtue of their business model in Asia that there is opportunity there also. Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey. This is Ryan Goodman for Justin. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on Battlefield and then one on mobile. For Battlefield, in the commentary, it sounds like the early play tests are actually going pretty well. So, just curious if you had any color on pre-order activities to date, how that's tracking versus your expectations. And then, second question on Battlefield, it's more in the content release strategy. Last year, with Battlefront II, there was a little pushback with the initial player and game progression system out of the gate. So, just curious, is there anything you can share with us in how you're thinking about the content release strategy or cadence with Battlefield? And then, separately on mobile, just \u2013 we're a couple of months into the Pre-Alpha in Command & Conquer, and you had the Rise to Power Pre-Alpha. Just would like any feedback you're seeing there, player reception, just anything to share there. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. We don't tend to directly comment on our unit forecast. What I'd tell you is we look at lots of different components, including pre-orders, but pre-orders continue to be less and less important in a digital world, but we do observe that. We look at everything that people are saying about the game, their intent to purchase the game, and communication around the game as measures of where it's going. We're happy with those. We're also excited about the number of people that played Command & Conquer, coming out of E3 when we allowed people to play it. It's early days there, but what we're hearing is it is an amazingly fun game that really gets people excited, particularly in groups. And so it made up opportunities beyond just individual game, and maybe more of a group game or even esports opportunities. So, we're excited about that, and it's in full test now and being finalized, and you'll see it later this year. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of content delivery for Battlefield V, and you referenced Battlefront II, our objective in Battlefront II is to deliver a large full featured experience at launch that has the opportunity for players to continue to engage in new and fresh content over time, and we've continued to deliver that. As we've talked about before, we had some issues with the progression system and the monetization system which we've since learned from and fixed, and launched a completely new progression system in that game. And the teams continued to work, and we announced new content including Clone Wars content at EA PLAY, and we're encouraged by the reception that we've had as a result of that. So, you should imagine that we have learned from that experience. And as we think about the launch of Battlefield V, again, our objective is to launch a spectacularly built game that is full featured with single player, where traditional multiplayer modes and new innovative multiplayer modes, including Battle Royale, over time. And while the base game that we launched will be large, deep and full featured, that we also understand that players expect to play these games for many months and sometimes years later, and that we have a long-term service plan in place for the delivery of ongoing content and ongoing modes at play. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So, we'll take one last question. Operator : Your last question comes from Evan Wingren from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Blake, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that ARPU in live services was a bit lower than you'd expected on Ultimate Team. I wonder if you could just give you a bit more color there in terms of what you saw in the components and how you're thinking about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. So, the pickup was just in FIFA. Actually, we had a very strong Madden Ultimate Team quarter, which is rare for the first quarter, so we enjoyed that. That not a huge business in the last quarter of the year before the football season starts. But in FIFA, we've \u2013 as Andrew mentioned, we brought a very large number of new or lapsed users into the game and into Ultimate Team. But we remind people \u2013 I think we've tried to temper people's enthusiasm around this when we first gave guidance \u2013 is that people oftentimes play Ultimate Team for months or years before they spend money, partially because they're learning how to play and they're having a lot of fun and they don't really understand how much more fun they'll have if they spend a little bit money. And so what we saw was more people in the game than we expected, but those people did not spend as much money or have money at all. And our view is that that's still a positive because we now see post Ultimate \u2013 or post World Cup, the Ultimate Team business continuing to grow and engage, and we think that's real positive coming out of the World Cup. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just to clarify, so you're not implying that people that do see value and pay for things in the game, that didn't actually trend worse than you thought or decline? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: No. No, I think the only thing you could probably assume is that someone in Germany who really enjoyed playing Ultimate Team probably didn't play after the Germans lost. And I can't quantify that for you but \u2013 or U.S. people who weren't even in the market may not have played as much. But that's the fun and excitement of World Cup, you have these unknown outcomes that keep people excited. But now the core continues to engage in Ultimate Team. And now we believe we're growing the core with some new players that came in through World Cup. Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And the follow-up was, you mentioned free-to-play and experimenting with that. Unless I have missed that, that's the \u2013 kind of the first time I've heard you speak about that. Could you contrast that with the subscription effort that you're doing? Is the thought there that that could be potentially moving towards a freemium like offering? Or is it really a separate endeavor, I guess, that you're looking at? And perhaps, what type of resources are you willing to put against an effort like that? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Yeah. I think \u2013 remember, we've been building free-to-play games in Asia for 10 or 15 years. We have a long experience there, and FIFA Online is a great example of that but we have other opportunities that we've had over the years in free-to-play there. We have a free-to-play mode inside Star Wars (01:01:25) business that we run for years as well. You can either subscribe to it or have a free-to-play version. We're always looking at new models. And my implication was, don't assume that we're going to do something immediately in something like Battlefield. But you should also assume we're looking at a lot of the franchises that we have or older franchises and asking the question, is there an opportunity to have a free-to-play version of that? So, more to come, nothing to announce in the next few quarters. But you will see things, we'll start testing sometime over the next year or so. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Well, great. Thank you, everyone, for your time, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the next few quarters and talking to everyone at the end of October. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. We had a strong second quarter, launching high-quality new games in our EA SPORTS franchises and delivering revenue and earnings above our guidance. With a busy and competitive holiday quarter ahead, our focus is on delivering for our players with new games, new experiences in our live services, and more fun and excitement across all platforms during one of the most popular times of the year for playing games. At EA, our strategy is to create and offer a collection of amazing games and content, wrapped in compelling services, with more ways to play, watch, share, and connect for players around the world. In Q2, we delivered against that with four new games, hundreds of content updates in our live services, record viewership in our esports programs, and continued expansion of the experience in our subscription services. For EA SPORTS, we released highly rated new experiences and content in Q2, including major updates and new ways to play in mobile. With FIFA 19, we set out this year to create a game that expanded our core FIFA product, adding UEFA Champions League and innovative new game modes. Our objective is always to grow the audience for FIFA through content that extends and enhances the experience. And our amazing development team delivered with a game that has been critically acclaimed as one of the best games of the franchise. As we have seen previously when we have delivered innovative and creative new ways to play, such as The Journey, FIFA players will jump into the new content first and over time move into Ultimate Team. So far since launch, we have more players engaging across a great breadth of modes, from Career Mode to Kickoff and Tournaments. For those players that have already moved into Ultimate Team, engagement is high, with more games played and more games per player on average year over year since launch. Players in Weekend League, our most competitive mode in FIFA Ultimate Team, have grown more than 75% year over year since the launch. As we now ramp into our live events inside the service, we expect the participation in Ultimate Team will continue to grow. We designed FIFA for long-term engagement. And while Blake will talk about how some of the engagement in this new content has shifted our FUT monetization in the near term, FIFA 19 is a game that will engage a growing global community every day from now until we launch the next one and beyond. Madden NFL 19 continues to bring new players into the franchise with the most immersive NFL experience we've ever delivered. Madden Ultimate Team, including popular modes like Seasons, Solo Challenges, and Weekend League are showing strong year-over-year engagement as we ramp into some of our biggest live events. Across our EA SPORTS portfolio, NHL 19 was our highest-rated NHL game on current generation consoles. NBA LIVE has been recognized by fans and critics for the unique connection to basketball culture, and FIFA Mobile daily active players increased significantly year over year in Q2, leading up to the new season that is set to launch on November 7. Excitement and engagement in our competitive gaming programs continues to grow. The 2018 FIFA eWorld Cup Final wrapped up our second FIFA esports season in August, setting records, including a 4x increase in global viewership over last year and more than 20 million players participating through the course of our FIFA 18 Global Series. As we set out this quarter for our third season, FIFA esports is now a global phenomenon. We will have three times as many major events, and we expect to launch with 15 official football league partners holding top flight competitions, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, MLS, and the world's most popular league, the Premier League. Both FIFA and Madden are proving a unique multiplier of traditional sports through the context of esports. Players who watch our esports content play more, return more frequently, and are choosing to invest more. With expanded competitive ecosystems and new experiences for our players this year, we see strong potential for continued growth, including increased revenue streams through sponsorship, licensing deals with esports leaders, and broadcast agreements, including ESPN, that continue to reach new audiences. Across consoles, mobile, PC, live services are increasingly the lifeblood of the experiences that players are engaging with today. This is when games continue to evolve for our player communities and where we can continue to deliver the choice, value, and fun that keeps them together with their friends over weeks, months, and years. In our Sims 4 live service, fans have downloaded nearly 30 million expansion packs life to date. And with our monthly average players continuing to grow year over year, we see a long future ahead for this game and its thriving community. We've also learned a lot through Star Wars Battlefront 2 about how to construct a strong first-person shooter live service. We're now beginning to deliver fan-requested Clone Wars content, and we have more to come for the community next year. These two games and many more give an important view into how we are creating games today that evolve with their communities well into the future. Throughout Q2, we had more than 10 million unique players engaged in our Battlefield games, building excitement for the launch of Battlefield V. On November 20, we will bring the community into a new Battlefield that has been designed from the ground up as a service. At launch, Battlefield V will be the deepest game we've ever made in the franchise, taking players into the unseen fronts, untold stories, and intense combat of the world's greatest conflict through bigger than ever multiplayer and gritty single-player War Stories. Then, just about two weeks later, our Tides of War live service will begin a regular cadence of major content updates delivered to all Battlefield V players. Each chapter of the service will bring a new dimension to the experience, fundamentally changing how the game is played. For the first three chapters, here's what to expect. In early December, our first chapter will launch, including a new single-player War Story, a new multiplayer map, tank battles, and more customization options for players. In chapter 2, we're adding co-op and new multiplayer experiences, including the fan favorite Rush Mode. In our third chapter, set for March, Firestorm Battle Royale will arrive along with another new location in Greece. Tides of War is a highly innovative new model for a massive, ever-expanding Battlefield, and we're very excited to begin bringing players into Battlefield V next month. As you saw with our announcement this morning, Command & Conquer: Rivals is set to launch worldwide for mobile players on December 4. It will also be our next official EA competitive gaming franchise, with the complete ecosystem beginning to roll out in Q4, including community tournaments and a championship pro scene. This is a fast-paced head-to-head strategy game that is easy to play, a lot of fun, and perfect for competitive play. We've had great engagement and feedback in our soft launch testing and strong interest from competitive players. This is our first entry into mobile esports, and we're excited for Command & Conquer: Rivals to expand our global audience of players and spectators. Looking ahead, our focus continues to be on connecting more players to more great experiences. On February 22, BioWare will launch their stunning and ambitious shared-world game, Anthem. The team has done an outstanding job executing against their vision for a game with amazing levels of complexity, scale, and innovation. Anthem has won more than 90 awards, including recognition as one of the most anticipated games of the year, and player feedback continues to be highly positive through our pre-launch testing. We can't wait to see this game come alive for fans at launch and through the long-term live services to come. Across multiple studios, we have new projects underway, including games from Respawn that are slated to launch by next holiday season. In our multi-product subscription services, we are pioneering a new value model that is lowering friction for members to access new content, including more than 100 games from EA and third-party developers and publishers. We have deeply talented and creative leaders and teams across the company, driven by the opportunity to put our scale behind their ideas and helping us continually push the boundaries for the global gaming community. We're looking forward to our opportunities ahead, building long-term engagement and lifetime value for players in ever-evolving live services like FIFA 19, Battlefield V, Anthem, and more. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. We're pleased with the strong profitability of our business through the second quarter, and particularly with the record Q2 digital net bookings. The digital transformation continues, with growth in full-game downloads and live services and the launch of our first frontline subscription service. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.286 billion, above our guidance by $16 million. Operating expenses were $610 million, $64 million lower than our guidance, driven by compensation and related expenses and some phasing of marketing expenses. GAAP operating income was $258 million compared to an operating loss of $41 million a year ago, and resulting in an earnings per share of $0.83, $0.35 better than our guidance. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, better gross margin, and lower operating expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $126 million, down $178 million from last year. The decrease was driven primarily by the timing of cash receipts, the timing of royalty payments, and by increased tax payments. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.458 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, resulting in free cash flow of negative $157 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter we also repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $299 million, leaving $1.88 billion in our two-year $2.4 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.5 billion. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.222 billion, up $43 million on the prior year and $62 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven primarily by full-game sales of FIFA 19 and FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Digital net bookings were $637 million, up 10% on the year-ago period and a new record for the second quarter. The main drivers of the increase were FIFA 19, FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Digital net bookings now represent 69% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis compared to 63% in the prior year. This is a new record for the period. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn, live services net bookings were up 6% year on year to $328 million, a new Q2 record. The increase was driven by FIFA, Madden and Madden Ultimate Teams, and The Sims 4, offset by the effects of the transition from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Asia. The Sims 4 live services are in their fourth year, continued to perform very strongly and are on track to grow 20% over fiscal 2018. In addition, our subscription services continue to grow, and we expect the launch of Battlefield V to drive additional subscriptions to our Origin Access Premier service. As a reminder, over the course of a year, our live services business is about 50% Ultimate Team, 30% other live services such as Sims 4 expansion packs and FIFA Online 4, and 20% subscriptions, advertising, and other. Mobile delivered net bookings of $152 million, up 1% year on year, with growth in our FIFA franchise on mobile mostly offset by a decline in Madden Mobile. The Madden team is working hard to turn this around, adding new social features, new game modes, and competitive tournaments. We have two updates out already and a major update coming in December. FIFA Mobile also has a long list of new features coming. Full-game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $157 million, 32% higher than last year, another Q2 record. Growth was driven by the ongoing shift to digital, timing of the recognition of net bookings from FIFA 19, and the earlier launch of Madden this year. The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year on year to 42%. FIFA 19 launched just days before the end of the quarter. But based on the first three weeks of sales, it was about 29% digital, up from 24% in the comparable period for FIFA 18. Over 42% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 36% a year ago. Turning to guidance, our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.15 billion and earnings per share of $3.11. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.65 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.525 billion. The reduction from prior estimates is driven by lower net income and a greater balance of bookings in the fourth quarter, some of which will be collected in fiscal 2020. To reiterate our guidance from our August announcement, we anticipate net bookings of $5.2 billion. This guidance was driven by the later launch of Battlefield V, which also reduces our expectations for live services and subscription revenue in the year, the FX headwind, and lower mobile net bookings. Our revised outlook is for net bookings to be roughly flat to the prior year. We're updating our digital growth targets for the fiscal year to give you more visibility into the changes within our business. We now expect live services to be approximately flat to up 5% year on year, with growth driven by FIFA Ultimate Team. This is lower than our original guidance, primarily due to the reduced expectations for Ultimate Team, the delay of Battlefield V, and the FX headwind. As Andrew mentioned, FIFA players are engaging with the new content we have added to FIFA 19, and this may be delaying the entry into FIFA Ultimate Team. However, once playing FIFA Ultimate Team, engagement metrics are up on last year. We expect our mobile net bookings to be about flat year on year. We have a couple of titles performing below our expectations, and we've moved Star Wars : Rise to Power out of fiscal 2019. Meanwhile, Command & Conquer: Rivals is performing well in soft launch, and FIFA Mobile is off to a strong start in China. Net bookings from full-game downloads are expected to grow 20% to 25%. This is significantly above our original expectations, primarily driven by the strength we are seeing in Anthem, which we expect to skew strongly digital, plus the digital shifts for our other titles. We continue to model an underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital. For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.375 billion, cost of revenue to be $446 million, and operating expenses of $730 million. OpEx is up year on year primarily due to increased investment in R&D. The results in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 306 million. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.725 billion. This is down 12% year on year, primarily because we had two extra launches in Q3 last year, Need for Speed : Payback and The Sims 4 for consoles. The fourth quarter will be stronger than we had originally forecast, driven by higher expectations for Anthem and Command & Conquer: Rivals. In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter. Our business model is robust because it is diverse with global revenues across multiple platforms, business models, and geographic territories. As a result, even with the challenges this year, we expect net bookings to be roughly flat year on year, with strong cash generation and continued growth in underlying net income. The digital transformation continues, and we're moving ahead with our growth strategy. Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Thanks, Blake. At EA, our transformation continues in constant pursuit of the future of interactive entertainment. The very definition of a game is changing, much as it did when we went from offline to online experiences. Games are evolving from finite experiences to live services with infinite potential. These are experiences that are constantly evolving and beginning to bypass the boundaries of devices, geography, and time. This is how games become an even more meaningful part of our daily lives, creating shared connections between you and your friends that exist both in-game and in the outside world. We are investing in the talent, the content and services, and the technology to deliver these breakthrough experiences in our games today and in the years to come. Across the organization, we have more than 5,000 deeply talented creators on our development team. We've cultivated incredible teams in our studios to deliver that across an unmatched breadth and depth of franchises and IP. These are the teams launching Battlefield V and beginning a long-term journey with millions of players through our live service. These are the teams that continually deliver for hundreds of millions of fans across EA SPORTS, The Sims, Star Wars, and more. Our Command & Conquer team is not only delivering a great new mobile game, but are also working with the content for the franchise's PC core. Teams across our studios, including BioWare, Respawn and Motive, are executing on their visions to bring next-generation experiences and content to life. And in other areas, we're fostering new dimensions of our creativity. We've recently launched a new internal creative council to incubate great content ideas and provide support to nascent projects, and we're advancing the work of our SEED Labs team working on disruptive new game designs. We're also well-positioned to lead through the rapid advancements in the technology landscape that are shaping the future of games. Engine technology, cloud, social layers, services, and distributed networks are converging to unlock new possibilities. We're expanding the capabilities of Frostbite with advances in ray-tracing, scalable world editing, AI, and other features that are bringing next-generation experiences to life. As we shared yesterday, we've also been developing Project Atlas, bringing together Frostbite with an expanding suite of digital services into a fully integrated platform that will enable us to more efficiently create and execute on new games that deliver amazing scalable, social, and deeply interactive experiences. Cloud gaming will enable games to reach new audiences and geographies, and we're continuing development on the streaming capabilities we debuted in June and exploring the disruptive combination we see for streaming with our industry-leading subscription services. Underpinning it all will be our Player Network, enabling our players to stay connected to their friends and the content they love wherever they are in the world. We're executing for our players today and positioning EA to lead and grow in the next evolution of games and entertainment. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : And your first question come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you very much. My question is really on the confidence you have for the outlook for fiscal Q4. When you mentioned higher expectations for Anthem, I'm curious what gives you confidence behind that. And also how much certainty do you have that the delayed live services revenue will materialize on FIFA? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think we're confident in both. I think everyone knows we tend to approach things fairly conservatively, and I think we've shown that in our recent guidance and results. We monitor FIFA on a daily basis and Ultimate Team on a daily basis, and we're seeing extremely good and strong metrics, as Andrew mentioned and I mentioned, around all the players who are playing. We also know how players are playing in other modes in the game, and we know the game is designed ultimately to steer them into Ultimate Team. And so we're confident that as they consume the content in FIFA, they will move into Ultimate Team. And we have a great many set of exciting events leading up to the holidays and then after the holidays. For example, this weekend we had our Halloween events around the globe. And despite the fact of Red Dead Redemption taking up a lot of attention in the marketplace, we had one of our strongest FIFA weekends we've seen \u2013 Ultimate Team weekends we've seen in a long time. So we're confident but we're also careful in how we forecast. We want to make sure that we're being straightforward with investors. We're also very excited about Anthem. Andrew mentioned it was getting a lot of positive feedback. We think it's a fabulous game, and you'll see a lot more of it to come after we get out of this holiday window into early next year. And I think our original expectations of the game were probably too low, and thus we think that's important. Remember also that our assumption is we'll sell more Battlefield V in Q4 than we would have originally anticipated as we move that out by four weeks. And any live services associated with that game or with Anthem obviously will also benefit Q4. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. I just had two questions. On Battlefield V, does the strength of the launches of the competitive titles in recent weeks leave you encouraged that there's a strong appetite for console titles in the current environment, or does it leave you, I guess, concerned that gamers maybe spending their budgets on those titles now? And then second, can you talk about some of the changes in creative leadership during the quarter and just how investors should be thinking about the talent that's moving in and out of the business? Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure, I'll take both those questions, Mike. In terms of our confidence in the Battlefield V launch with respect to other things that are happening this year, I think the industry is vibrant and growing, and we couldn't be more excited for our Battlefield V launch. As I said in the prepared remarks, we've still got over 10 million players on our existing Battlefield games that we are in direct communication with as we go into launch. Battlefield has a tremendously rich and robust community who love those only-in-Battlefield moments. We're coming out with strong multiplayer, strong single player, but also the promise of a tremendous live service with content that's free for all players in the months and years to come. So I think we feel good about that, even in the context of what have been some other strong launches, and I think that's additive to what we're going to do there. In terms of creative leadership, again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we have over 5,000 developers in the organization. I think we've got one of the deepest and broadest benches of creative leaders. We made some changes through the quarter in service of stronger creativity in the organization as well as stronger execution across the organization. Again, as we think about the future of games, and I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, we are planning for the future. We see a world where games are no longer bound by device or CPU or GPU. We see a world where they span across platforms, across business models, across geographies. In some of the divisions we made during the quarter, specifically around Samantha Ryan, we're bringing these types of games together who service a very particular player cohort in the context of action, adventure, RPG, and simulation. And we feel very good about the level of collaboration we're going to able to achieve across that group to deliver both creativity, innovation, and execution more broadly. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys, maybe one on capital. Given how much the stock has underperformed recently, I wanted to get a refreshed view on the way you guys are thinking about leverage, possibly returning capital to shareholders, and with the arsenal of ways to create equity value, how you also might be thinking about the M&A landscape. Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So good questions. Clearly, we've been active at buying back stock in the quarter. We try to pace our buybacks around the life of the program versus any certain stock price. We oftentimes don't even pay attention to the stock price on a day-to-day basis because we know there are lots of things that move the market that are well beyond our control. And so our goal is to simply allocate a certain amount of capital to buybacks and then be in the market to buy back that stock every single day and hit our targets of, in this case, $2.4 billion over two years. In terms of M&A, we're clearly keeping our eyes open on everything that's out there. This is all about collecting great content and talent, and we're looking for ways to do that at every possible opportunity we have, and we'll continue to do that. I can't predict anything at this point in time. But part of the reason that we want to leave dry powder both in the terms of cash and in the terms of debt capacity, our capital structure is for the opportunity that could come to us at some point in time to be able to step in and buy an asset or acquire talent and titles that would be helpful to our long-term vision of both subscriptions and streaming. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : And your next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi there. I need some help on mobile. So it looks to me like we have a trailing 12-month mobile fees of $93 million, but a projected full-year for 2019 at $220 million, but mobile is growing at 1%. And can you bridge that? I thought those were rev shares on the mobile platform. How is it that the mobile fees are growing so much faster than mobile revenue? That's my first question. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: I think you're probably missing possibly some deferrals as you go from GAAP to our management reporting numbers. The mobile platform fees are purely what we pay to the mobile platforms like Google or Apple. So essentially, that's the 30% that they take and we book 70%. We can probably go through with you offline the specific numbers just to line them up. I think the key growth driver to remember is we'll add a new title, Command & Conquer, on December 4. We just announced this morning. That will drive substantial growth in mobile during the tail end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and give you some of the mobile growth for the full year. But we have, as we showed on the script, adjusted our mobile full-year guidance off of what we originally thought we would do to now a lower level, which we believe to be really around flat for the year. So a combination of all those things probably gets you back to where would like to see it in your model. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I was really intrigued by this prior comment on Samantha Ryan, where you're servicing a particular player. Is that a pivot towards looking at creating an organizational design around identifying player segments and actually targeting games, a series of games to particular players now? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So yes, that's one piece of the puzzle. Again, we have a lot of data across our more than 350 million players in our network and certainly many more players across our mobile games that we don't know as much about. And what we have come to understand over the recent years is that players are always looking for very specific motivations in the context of play. And some players are looking to fulfill different motivations at different times or on different platforms, and we've started to better understand that in terms of creating new and innovative and creative content for our players. And one of the things that we've seen, particularly as we look to the future when we think about moving many of those experiences to the cloud over time, which unbounds them from the platform that they may have previously been subjected to, is that we have to start thinking about in the context of how they fulfill those motivations over time. We've seen tremendous strength in the collaboration across our EA SPORTS portfolio, both in the context of our core game, core feature sets, and the live services that we built on top of those. And part of what we've looked at in this construct is our ability to do that across action-adventure, RPG, and simulation, all of whom support a collective player set who are looking to fulfill similar motivations. And you should expect over time as we continue to transform the nature of discovery, purchase, and enjoyment across games that we'll continue to try and organize around player cohorts to better service their needs and support what they're looking for out of their games. Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks, that's super-helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Andrew, FIFA is already out and localized in China. But can you update us on what your distribution partners may be saying about changes to the approval process there in what looks like a more stringent operating environment, as this might impact your ability to release other new games in the country? And, Blake, the digital download gap between Madden and FIFA is at 13% based on your prepared remarks. So I guess some of this was due to greater payment friction in Europe and other factors. So is the adoption path for those users now similar to what you saw in the U.S. at the same time? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Sure, I'll take the first one. Right now, we have our products out in China. And because they're approved, they're in the marketplace and doing well. As far as we can tell at this stage, this should not impact our titles. FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile are doing well, and the next title launch in China for us is some way off. And so our hope is that delays are fixed by then. And while we continue to monitor the situation, we don't see any direct impact right now. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Our understanding is it's more through interactions with Tencent and other partners, it's more of a backlog problem than an actual not really approving games. I think as they changed agencies, the backlog built up fairly quickly. So we don't see that as an impact for us, at least in the next year or so, as we focus mainly on FIFA. In terms of the full-game download stats, we've always seen FIFA lag Madden because Madden is pretty much a domestic U.S. business, where FIFA is a global business. And in many parts of the world where FIFA is shipped, the bandwidth speeds are still slow and there may be some payment issues or just payment cultures that differ. Germany, for example, tends not to use credit cards, and so we have lower full-game downloads in that marketplace. That is changing, and we've seen the pace of change of FIFA track pretty much the same pace of change with the other games. It just started from a lower base. And some of it historically was due to the fact that retailers would use FIFA to drive traffic into their stores. That's starting to abate because, once again, fewer and fewer people are buying physical disks. So we believe that same pace will continue, and obviously it's great to see all of our games tracking as a whole at 42%, meaning that some games are well north of that if FIFA is on the south side of that. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks, a couple of questions for me. I guess first with respect to the third quarter guidance, I'm wondering if you could expand on how much of a promotional environment you're baking into the outlook for the Battlefield V release. And then as a follow-up to the live services segment and the guidance, just given some concerns that still exist around user monetization maybe beginning to flatten out a bit, I wonder if you could talk about how much growth we should expect in ARPU within the individual franchises such as FIFA and Battlefield versus growth in the user base as a driver. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So in terms of the promotional plans, our promotional plans are pretty consistent with what we've had in the past. With the case of Battlefield, actually we will not be on promotion on Black Friday because we ship that week. There may be selected retailers that choose to promote it on their own, but we're not supporting those promotions. And then we'll have the regular promotion schedule that you would see through December into the holidays. Similar things for each title, the timing is different and the retail mix will be different. But you should see promotions, both digitally and physical copies, but not that different than what we've seen historically with the exception of the Battlefield V issue relative to Black Friday. And we see that that's pretty consistent with past years. It's always a promotional time of the year. It drives a lot of volume, and we're very supportive of our retail partners and our platform partners who want to continue to keep people engaged. In terms of the Q3 numbers, our focus is always on driving more users into the live service. That's the way to keep a very large market in place and continue to keep it very healthy. The moment you stop focusing on that, you really lose the strength of live services, which is a large marketplace where people can all play together. If you focus too much on revenue generation per person, you start to squeeze the players, and we're very careful not to do that. It happens naturally in some cases due to people's level of engagement, but we're very careful not to allow people to start to spend too much because we know they'll churn out of the business. So our goal, as I think Andrew mentioned before, is to build really exciting great games. We think we've done an amazing job with FIFA, probably the best FIFA we've ever built. And it's got so much content in there that that allows people to play a long time. And if that means that they start playing Ultimate Team or playing Ultimate Team at a level a little bit later, we're fine with that as long as they're enjoying themselves in the game. And we think that's what's going on during the \u2013 and what we're seeing in the quarter. I also remind people, we didn't give new phasing for the quarter when we moved Battlefield out. We just told people what the total year's numbers were, and we left it to everyone to deliver their own phasing. And so I caution people to be overly emphasis on comparing to what they had because what they had before wasn't informed by our giving some sense of things like the mobile title that moved out, when Command & Conquer would start, the impact of FX on the quarter, and the general overall view of our business during the quarter. So just don't over-index on the two quarters, focus on the full-year guidance, which did not change. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Cost - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, it's Matt Cost on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. So on that point about the Battlefield delay, can you give a little bit more color, if you can, around the unit potential for the game, and then bigger picture, how you think about the potential for in-game monetization in the new Battlefield compared to the prior installment? And then the second question is subscription and streaming obviously is a topic you guys have been very forward on. You recently announced Project Atlas. What do you think are some of the key next steps needed to drive a material transition into subscription and then streaming-based ecosystem? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So why don't I start and then I'll let Andrew talk about the second question. Battlefield, the overall forecast really only changed just because of the timing. So when we told people that that moved roughly 3 million-plus units out of the quarter that we originally had expected, some of that into Q4 and some of it into next year's Q1. What you'll find when you get into Battlefield, and I'll leave it up to the Battlefield team to help people understand the excitement around where Battlefield is going and how that might include in-game monetization, but what I'll just say is there will be dramatic evolving gameplay over time : new ways to experience it, things like fortification and reinforcements and new hardware vehicles, weapons, gadgets, and there could be exciting ways to earn those over time or possibly even purchase those over time; new experiences through the single-player stories that will continue to be rolled out; game improvements and excitement around a Battle Royale style mode that will come in the March timeframe; and a pretty exciting live service that we hope will keep people highly engaged. And over time, that may include monetization opportunities to keep them even more engaged. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of content streaming, we've talked a lot about this, that the greatest disruption of the consumption of entertainment media over the last five years has been a combination of those two things. Right now, we're treating them on separate vectors, but ultimately expect that we will bring them together over time. We launched our first subscription what is now over four years ago as a catalog subscription on Xbox and then took that to PC, and we're able to get tremendous learning out of that. And what we have seen is that people who come into that subscription \u2013 again, by definition a subscription is the offering of an amazing collection of high-quality content at a great consumer value proposition with as low friction as possible. And what we have seen from people who have come into that is they play more games, they spend more time, and ultimately they monetize higher in live services as well. We know that great new blockbuster content adds subscribers, and we know that great catalog content retains subscribers, no different than traditional linear media. And so what we have started to do with the launch of our Origin Access Premier this year is to add front-line blockbuster content, and Battlefield V will be the first opportunity for us to truly understand that. We saw really strong uptake after Madden. But remember, Madden hadn't been on PC for nearly a decade. The PC community of Battlefield is very, very strong, and we expect to get tremendous learning out of that as we grow that. In terms of next steps, you should expect us to continue to try and aggregate more content for our players, again, always improving the collection of content and the consumer value proposition, so that players can come in and play more games and spend more time. Some of that will be the creation of new content organically inside of our company. Some of it will be working with indie developers or third-party developers and publishers. And as Blake pointed out, as a long-term vision, we also expect that we would look to acquire both content IP and talent over time. As you think about the context of streaming, we announced and demonstrated in June a streaming service that was working at EA PLAY. We've continued to develop that and continue to work on making that a better experience for players. We're also working with some other third parties that you may have heard about who are developing streaming services, and we believe that our service can work in conjunction with their services over time, ultimately, substantially increasing the total addressable market of players that we have access to and the ability to deliver great games and experiences to. You referenced Project Atlas. That's really an ambitious plan that we've been executing against to make it easier to move these experiences to the cloud by bringing Frostbite and a collected digital platform of services together, so that our game makers are able to effectively execute and deliver the types of innovative game experiences that they see players will want over the next three years. As you can imagine, we've had a lot of inbound requests around that platform and third parties out there who would look to \u2013 who would love the ability to utilize that technology, that combined platform of engine plus digital services. And as we think about adding more content to our subscription over time, we also see that as a tool that would allow us to do that. So add more content to our sub through licensing and potentially acquisition, continue to develop on our streaming solutions both as an isolated service for us as well as in conjunction with others, and then bringing our combined digital platform engine and digital service and Project Atlas to help us get there faster, more quickly, more efficiently, and with more innovative and creative games both developed internally and potentially at some time developed externally. Matthew Cost - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Raymond Stochel from Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great, thanks so much for taking my question. I guess a couple things on Project Atlas. So number one would be how are you thinking about user-generated content in games longer term? You alluded to that in the Project Atlas announcement. And then secondarily, in a streaming world, can you give us a better sense as to your mobile strategy? You obviously have a number of mobile titles in development that are exclusive mobile titles. How do you think about development over time in a more cross-platform and streaming way? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Two great questions. So first in terms of user-generated content, as we look out in the world today, some of the richest ecosystems have a robust community of creatives that are delivering new content experiences for their fellow players on a daily basis. And for us, The Sims franchise has been that since its inception. Part of what we're doing now, we're building that capability into our toolset so that game makers can implement that in future games and bring communities together. Again, in a world that we have a vision of entertaining 1 billion people in play, we are very aware that delivering against the insatiable appetites of that many players across the globe is beyond the scope of just our creative organization. But in the context of having our creative organization see these great worlds and these great characters and these great stories, and having AI amplify that effort in conjunction with large and robust communities of tens and potentially hundreds of millions of players creating content in large scalable simulated worlds, we feel like that's the future of games. We've been investing for some years against it. We're now in a place when we're ready to talk about it, and we're starting to invite people in, including these community creatives, to help us really build out that robust toolset. As we think about mobile strategy going forward, again, over time we do believe that many experiences will move to the cloud and they'll no longer be bound by local devices, whether it's CPU, GPU, memory, or battery life. And more the experiences will be governed by the screen size you have access to and the session time that you have. With that said, we also understand that there will be some players that only ever play on their mobile device, and some players who spend a great or disproportionate amount of time playing on an 80-inch screen. And so we will continue to develop experiences that are rich and robust as those native experiences today, but always with a view of allowing them to connect their experience across streams, but more importantly, to connect with a global community of players regardless of which screen they access a game through. And that's a fundamental shift in how we design the architecture of games. It's also a fundamental shift in how we design the features of games. But in all things, it's about entertaining with innovative and creative experiences that you can experience based on your choice of how you want to play, but where you never feel disconnected from this global community of friends that you have. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, so one question on live services and a clarification. So live services are now expected to be up plus or minus plus 5%, and I think you point out that Ultimate Team is the biggest driver there. It seems to be growing mid-single-digits in the first half results prior to indications. So can you help us understand in the second half why the live services overall shouldn't be up in Q4 year over year just given Battlefront II and Star Wars really didn't really have any updates last year? And I think you have already Black (51:03) coming already in December with Battlefront V this year. Is there anything we should look to for emerging trajectories for Ultimate Team versus maybe (51:14) both year over year, any of those comments? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So assume that we've got very little live service revenue in for either Battlefield or Anthem because they're very new. And until we understand exactly how well does it monetize, we didn't put much of that into our forecast. We'll still see some of the transition impact on FIFA Online 4, which will continue to be a drag. And we've got a forecast for subscriptions, but we're guessing a little bit as to the uptake of Premier based on the fact that we haven't yet seen the real true PC-based titles like Battlefield and Anthem. We'll have a lot better sense once we get through those. So I'd say some of it is just conservatism and forecasting, and some of it is the associations that I just mentioned around live services. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay great, and then just a quick clarification. It's been a couple years since Respawn has done anything with its flagship Titanfall franchise, but I'm not sure if I heard that correctly. It sounded like we should expect games, plural, from Respawn I suppose next year. Did I hear that correctly? I know that you revealed Star Wars 2 at E3, but is there anything else that we should be aware of? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So you weren't coming through very loud. But I think I got what you said, which is you heard Andrew use a plural when he said games from Respawn. Just consider that a little Easter egg left in the earnings call for you. We'll announce more when we get there. But clearly we've got a lot of things working with all of our studios, and you should assume that there will be some things that we haven't announced that come out later in the year when we go to give guidance for next year. Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the questions, a couple of topics. First on Anthem, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there that made you raise your outlook for Anthem in your guidance? And then a follow-up on mobile, I guess growth there has really stalled. What changes need to be made to restimulate growth in mobile? And if you could, just tell us how important you see mobile being to your future and if you need to make an acquisition there, potentially a larger one, to improve that business. Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: Let me start with Anthem and I'll let Andrew address the mobile piece. Anthem, it's a brand-new IP. And so when we originally forecasted it, we forecasted it at a pretty low level, as we thought about without a lot of information. That was last May or April when we put that forecast together. As we've gotten deeper into the final parts of the game and we had it tested with a lot of people, clearly the excitement is building. It started building at E3 as people learned what the game was and saw it. And so typically, when you're forecasting a brand-new IP, you usually start lower and then build that forecast over time, and that's essentially what we've done. We're getting excitement both internally and externally about the game. As Andrew mentioned, it's very different than anything BioWare has built in the past. It looks stunning and it plays extremely well. And that's what's given us more confidence around the forecast. But remember also, as I said earlier, we did not provide new phasing of a forecast. So you should assume that it's not all coming from Anthem. There may be obviously stuff -more from Battlefield V in Q4 than we originally were thinking in our forecast, as well as the mobile title that we talked about, Command & Conquer. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of mobile, as Blake highlighted earlier, where there is an opportunity to bring on new teams or new IP of any category or across any platform, we're open to that right now. However, as I look at the mobile industry and the mobile Top 20 or Top 30 charts, it's not immediately apparent what you would go after. We've seen some fairly significant shift in the mobile marketplace from where it was even a year or two years ago. And it's now also pretty well understood that many of the players that were reaching some fairly serious revenue heights over the last year or two were also outspending their revenue and weren't profitable companies and weren't growing profitably. I think what we have always maintained across our mobile business is that we believe we have a tremendously strong portfolio of content, and we were going to take the time to ensure that we delivered profitable growth over time. And while that growth has slowed this year as a result of some title shifts and title moves, we feel actually very bullish on the future. Command & Conquer I'm very excited about. I think it's a unique and innovative new entry into the mobile genre. I think we clearly have the leading sports business, which is a business that we are committed to and we'll continue to grow. We're seeing \u2013 we have some other products in development right now that will come out in the years to come that I think have started to play into the strength in mobile, as mobile players are looking for creativity and innovation in their experience. And again, as we look at the Top 10 or Top 20 charts, there's also a much greater representation from China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia in terms of title strength. And as I look at what we're doing with Command & Conquer, which has a tremendous fan base throughout the Asia region, and FIFA, I feel good about that. And so while we're always open to acquisition, I think that we also feel very good that the mobile industry is actually moving in a direction where the types of games that we make will be very, very well received. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Buckingham Research. Matthew Harrigan - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. I was just curious if you had any thoughts on the decision by Sony as well as Microsoft to do a next-gen console and how that laces into your perspective, interlaces into your perspective on the business and the evolution toward the cloud and the continued importance of consoles. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So I think that there is a few articles out there and a few rumors and a little hearsay as to what they are and when they're coming and what they might be. I don't think we're in a position today to have a conversation on that. But just know that we've worked with Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo for many, many years and look forward to working with them for many, many years more, even if collectively we all seek to move either some portion or all of our experiences to the cloud. Matthew Harrigan - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: One last question. Operator : Your last question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here, a couple clarifications, if I could. Blake, you talked about the FIFA franchise. To be clear, I guess are front-line players and hours up year on year and thus we just need to get the monetization lever moving here over the coming months and quarters, or are players and hours down and thus monetization has got to work harder? That was question number one. And again, I apologize if I missed that answer. Secondly, you talked a little bit about a second Respawn title next year. Would that also be in the holiday quarter? I'm not sure if you mentioned that or not or if you have any color around timing. And then just finally, Andrew, you talked a lot about Project Atlas obviously. So it sounds like that might be a platform you would think about licensing out to other developers, either on a per seat type of basis or revenue share type of a basis, but building a part that's open to third-party monetization. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: So FIFA, we said FIFA sales were strong in the quarter. So you should assume we've done well with FIFA. We also mentioned that people were playing more modes in FIFA. We also still have quite a few people playing FIFA 18. We were successful bringing them into World Cup, and many of those have not yet converted over to FIFA 19. So it's hard to say today ultimately how it will play out because we're still early in the third quarter. So I would just say we'll see what that looks like over the next two and half months or two months as we get into the rest of the year and even into the fourth quarter. FIFA tends to sell well all through the holidays. And so it's just too early to say one way or the other what people are spending their time on or not. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.: In terms of Project Atlas, again, when we set out on this journey, the objective was to ensure that we had industry-leading technology for our developers to build the most innovative and immersive and creative games, everything from sports games to large world simulations. And in a world where it's becoming increasingly complex to do that, we also understand that is hard for other people. And so as we have started talking to developers and publishers about bringing content into our subscription over time, as you might imagine, we've had a lot of inbound interest on the utilization of a technology platform like Project Atlas that would make it easier for them to create content in this growing complex world. And so while we have no locked-in plans or timelines today, we're certainly developing the technology with a view that over time our objective is to bring the greatest collection of content together as part of our industry-leading subscriptions. And at some level, that might mean offering our technology for use by third parties so that they can do that and then ultimately put their content into our subscription. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.: And on your Respawn question \u2013 I skipped over it \u2013 we'll have more to come on that. We'll read people as we get into the fourth quarter timeframe before we run into next year's full-year guidance. Thank you, everyone, talk to everyone next quarter. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks Mike. Welcome to EA's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we've posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2019. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, February 5, 2019, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Note that our results reflect our adoption of ASC 606 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 and for more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we have posted on our IR website. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Chris. The gaming industry continued to grow through the holiday quarter in our fiscal year 2019. It\u2019s been a highly competitive year, with lots of great new content for players around the world. In the face of this competition, we had significant challenges in Q3 and did not perform up to our expectations. We expect these challenges will continue to impact our performance in Q4, which has led us to lower our full fiscal year net revenue guidance today. Let me first discuss our challenges and the adjustments we are making to address them, then I will discuss the opportunities ahead. We'll start with Battlefield V. We made some decisions on launch timing and key features of this game that we felt would improve the quality of the experience. For context, Battlefield V was designed from the beginning to offer a long-term live service. In August, we determined that we needed some more time for final adjustments to the core gameplay to fully deliver on the potential of the live service, so we moved the ship date to November to accommodate those goals. Unfortunately, the later release date meant the game launched deeper into a competitive holiday window where heavy price discounting was a big factor. In addition, we also made the decision to prioritize other features, including a single-player experience, at launch over a Battle Royale mode. This year, Battle Royale modes became incredibly popular in shooter games. As a result of these decisions, we struggled to gain momentum and we did not met our sales expectations for the quarter. Importantly though, the Battlefield franchise is strong. More than 27 million fans have played our Battlefield games this fiscal year-to-date. Our focus is now on bringing more of these players into Battlefield V with new modes and great content through our live service. In March, we'll kick off our third chapter of updates in the game, which will include, amongst other things, Firestorm Battle Royale. This will be a unique take on the royale genre, integrating unique Battlefield characteristics including strategic squad gameplay, varying objectives, and vehicles. We're responding to our players in Battlefield V by delivering the content they want most into the live service, on a cadence that will fuel the community with fresh new experiences for many months to come. Next I'll touch on mobile. While the mobile market is strong and expected to continue growing nearly 10% next year, the dynamics have become increasingly challenging. The data we have indicates that the average age of Top 20 titles is greater than three years, and that it\u2019s harder than ever for new games to break through. With our latest release, Command & Conquer: Rivals, we had positive soft launch results, but since global release it has not driven installs organically at the levels we anticipated. We are now working to bring more players into that game. We continue to be committed to mobile. We believe in the value of our franchises in the marketplace, and we are doubling down on these games through live services. We are also putting our best teams on bigger projects, and exploring additional ways to create and iterate quickly. We have always focused on profitability in mobile, and we are evolving to better position ourselves for growth in the future. Our performance in Asia was also not as strong as expected through Q3. In Korea, FIFA Online 4 is performing well, with monthly average players exceeding the trajectory of FIFA Online 3 in a similar period from launch. Given nuances in the Chinese market, our transition to FIFA Online 4 has been slower than anticipated, and FIFA Mobile is still in early stages after launching in the market. We have long-term strategies with robust content plans for both games that, combined with the popularity and growth of soccer in the region, we believe will fuel further growth. FIFA continues to be a growing business for us. In fact, we sold more units of FIFA last calendar year than any year before, and we welcomed four million new players into our FIFA ecosystem on console and PC. Our plans for FIFA 18 were aggressive in a World Cup year, and we ended up selling an additional 2.4 million units of FIFA 18 throughout the year, with the intention of converting those players to FIFA 19 when it launched. The conversion has been slower than planned, leading to unit sales that were effectively flat year-over-year. In a year where there was intense competition and many iterative titles were challenged, FIFA 19 still became the best-selling console game in Europe last calendar year. Even on a flat year-over-year install base, FIFA Ultimate Team has performed well, and it accelerated in January with our most successful Team of the Year event ever. Our competitive gaming programs are also adding strength to the franchise, with our expanded FIFA Global Series already garnering 80% more total minutes watched compared to last fiscal year, along with new sponsor engagements and partnerships with industry leaders such as Eleague, Gfinity, and PGL. We continue to be very positive on the strength of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team around the world. We made some calculated decisions that did not work as planned in Q3, and we did not execute well in other areas of our business. Against the backdrop of a very competitive quarter, the combination of those factors led to our underperformance. While we are disappointed with the results, we understand where our challenges are, and we are deeply focused on applying the strengths of our company to address them going forward. We are a learning organization. Over the last six months, we've made organizational changes to shape our teams against our priorities for the future. We've made operational changes to better position ourselves to effectively drive live services and serve our player communities. We've made creative changes, including the formation of a Creative Council to strengthen our creative decision-making. And we will continue to make refinements in each of these dimensions as we focus sharply on execution across the company. The future of this industry is strong, and so is the future of Electronic Arts. As you saw yesterday, we just launched Apex Legends, a new free-to-play Battle Royale game from Respawn. This is very exciting for us. Built from the ground-up to bring innovation to the genre, there are so many unique elements of Apex Legends, from the characters, to the gameplay mechanics, to the teamplay construct. To compete in the highly-competitive Battle Royale space, we also deliberately chose a different go-to-market strategy to surprise and delight players around the world. The launch yesterday was EA's biggest reveal ever by peak concurrent viewers, and it quickly became the number one game on Twitch. The Respawn team has a strong plan for Apex Legends that will engage fans for a long time to come. As the live service evolves, Respawn also plans to launch a premium game this year that is a new twist on the Titanfall universe. More to come on that in the months ahead. Also this month, we will launch Anthem, BioWare's epic new game. Our teams at Bioware have poured so much passion into crafting every aspect of this massive new IP. Millions of fans played more than 40 million hours of Anthem in our recent demos, and we're very pleased to see the excitement in retail and digital channels reaching higher-than-expected levels. Anthem has been on dozens of lists for the most-anticipated games of 2019, and the full game launches on February 22. Looking ahead to FY20, we have a large slate of new games, beginning with some big new additions in our next FIFA title. There was great energy and engagement from NFL fans throughout this past season, we're excited for our plans with the Madden NFL franchise. We will continue innovating and driving our NHL and NBA LIVE games deeper into the fabric of their respective sports. We'll have a new game for our Need for Speed fans, and a new title in our PvZ shooter franchise on console and PC. In addition to Apex Legends, another team at Respawn is set to deliver Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order this fall. This game's development is led by the former director of the God of War series, with a team of veterans from some of the industry's biggest action-adventure games. It\u2019s very far along in development, and having spent time with it recently myself, it plays spectacularly well. This game truly captures the fantasy of becoming a Jedi, and we will have a lot more to share soon. In FY20, we're also set to deliver more content and new experiences in more live services than ever before. We're excited to continue building on the success of our Ultimate Team modes for EA SPORTS. Our Sims franchise continues to thrive in live services \u2013 our Sims 4 community grew by 4.8 million unique players last year, our monthly active players continue to grow year-over-year, and we just crossed $1 billion in lifetime revenue for the game. We continue to have strong expectations for The Sims going forward, and in FY20 we're bringing at least 20 new content drops and expansion packs to our Sims games across PC, mobile and console. We will continue to support Battlefield V and Anthem throughout the year, and Apex Legends will bring seasons of new content and much more to its players. With the breadth and depth of our live services offerings, we are focusing on delivering more of the content that resonates with our communities to drive additional upside opportunities in FY20. This is a challenging second half of our FY19. We are making critical adjustments to sharpen our focus on execution, and to ensure we are well-positioned to deliver more great games and services to our players. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. When we guided the year last May, we had high expectations for Battlefield V, we expected to grow our existing mobile titles and had anticipated launching two new mobile games. As Andrew outlined, it didn't play out as we planned. We decided to move Battlefield V into a difficult launch window against heavily discounted competition; and on mobile, we moved one of our titles out of the year. C&C Rivals is ramping slowly, and we made changes to Madden Mobile that reduced monetization. On top of this, unprecedented competition for players' time impacted the growth of our titles. However, the performance of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team was a bright spot, with the franchise proving extremely resilient in the face of intense competition. In addition, we set a new third quarter record for operating cash flow over the last twelve months. I have decided to give additional details this quarter about which parts of our business are, and are not, performing up to our expectations. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of the business. To compare this quarter's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.289 billion, below our guidance by $86 million. Operating expenses were $634 million, $96 million lower than our guidance, driven by variable compensation and related expenses, and some phasing of marketing expenses. GAAP operating income was $242 million, and resulted in an earnings per share of $0.86, $0.25 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $954 million, up $105 million from last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.563 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $933 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $292 million, leaving $1.59 billion in our two-year $2.4 billion buyback program we began last May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.2 billion. Life to date, FIFA 19 full game unit sales are roughly flat to FIFA 18, and slightly below our expectations. We believe the underperformance was driven by the intense competition throughout this year. It is possible that the success of the World Cup promotions pulled FIFA 19 sales into FIFA 18, given that, during calendar 2018; we sold more copies of FIFA than ever before. Fiscal year-to-date sales of FIFA 19 are approximately 20 million units, and we've also sold over 3 million units of FIFA 18 this fiscal year. And, as Andrew said, FIFA 19 was the best-selling console game in Europe in calendar 2018. FIFA Ultimate Team delivered its best quarter ever, up 6% from last year's Q3, which was an all-time high due to the addition of esports. Although fewer people than expected have bought FIFA 19, average spend per payer is up over last year's title. Madden Ultimate Team is up double-digits life to date. As Andrew discussed, the desire to make changes to Battlefield V led us to move its launch into a more difficult window, and prioritizing the single-player campaign over Battle Royale also hurt sales. As a result, we sold 7.3 million units in the quarter, about 1 million less than comprehended by our Q3 guidance. However, people play Battlefield for a long time, and we're in this for the long haul. Battlefield 1 still has nearly 4 million monthly active users, and Battlefield 4 has nearly two million, more than five years after its launch. When we released the Season 2 content in January, Battlefield V became the largest Battlefield game ever. And we have an exciting live services plan ahead of us, with the launch of the Firestorm Battle Royale game mode in March and continuing through fiscal 2020. The live services content presents an opportunity for upside as we look to sell more copies of the base game and players invest in cosmetic changes to their characters. Battlefield V drove fewer Origin Access Premier subscriptions than we had hoped, given the difficult launch of the game. We remain committed to subscriptions, and we look forward to attracting further subscribers with the launch of Anthem. We are using the launches this year to help us drive the evolution of the service. We entered the year expecting strong Mobile growth, but a combination of a delayed game and underperformance means the business will end the year down. The mobile market is characterized by a small number of highly successful games together with a long tail of much smaller games, many of which merely break even or actually lose money. Our focus has been, and continues to be, on building profitable franchises. Our business continues to be profitable, but growth is unpredictable in such a market. We continually review how we might improve the performance of this business. We launched Apex Legends, a Battle Royale experience in the Titanfall universe, yesterday. It's free to play but a day in is too early to talk about the power of the business model. The Respawn team has executed well to deliver an innovative take on the Battle Royale genre. They have enthusiastically driven the creation of one of the few large-scale free-to-play experiences on console, and we have a great live services to come. Digital net bookings were $1.199 billion, down 3% on the year-ago period. Strong digital sales of Battlefield V compared to Star Wars Battlefront II were more than offset by the decline in our mobile business and the extra game launch in last year's third quarter. Digital net bookings now represent 74% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 67% in the prior year. Live services net bookings were down 0.4%, to $784 million. FIFA Ultimate Team grew, but did not offset the decline in Battlefield 1 live services and FIFA Online in Asia. Mobile delivered net bookings of $142 million, down 22% year on year, with declines across our portfolio. We had made some changes to Madden Mobile in order to broaden its appeal, but monetization fell. We continue to work to turn this around. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $273 million, 5% higher than last year. Growth was driven by the ongoing shift to digital, in particular, for FIFA 19, for which sell-through is 27% digital, life to date, compared to 21% for FIFA 18 last year. Overall, 47% of our units sold were through digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 37% a year ago. Because Battlefield V skews much more digital than Star Wars Battlefront II, we continue to model underlying annual growth of about 5 percentage points. Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP net revenue is $4.875 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $3.20. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.35 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.225 billion. We now anticipate fiscal 2019 net bookings of $4.75 billion. This is below our previous expectations, based primarily on performance to date of Battlefield V, mobile, and Origin Access. We model Anthem units in the 5 to 6 million unit range, and do not model material net bookings for Apex Legends in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.163 billion, cost of revenue to be $265 million, and operating expenses of $715 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, primarily due to the launches of two major titles as opposed to one last year, and increased investment in R&D. This results in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for the fourth quarter using the diluted share count of 303 million. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.17 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with Anthem offset by broad-based weakness. Our experiences this quarter have reset our expectations for growth this year and next. And that means we must make some hard choices about investments. Nevertheless, this quarter has shown that we will continue to be a business with great brands that enable us to generate strong cash flow for investors. In fiscal 2020, we will continue to innovate in our sports titles, with growth for them expected to be in the range of flat to up 5%. In particular, FIFA 20 will include some significant new features, and we plan for both FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team to grow over this year. We will drive the Titanfall universe forward with Apex Legends live services and a premium game later in the year. We will launch Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, a new Plants vs. Zombies shooter and a new Need for Speed. We have modest expectations for Battlefield and Anthem live services, given that they are not yet proven. We continue to refine mobile live services and work on new games. Overall, we expect net bookings to grow low-single-digits and the underlying profitability to grow in line with that. We will provide further details and a P&L forecast when we report in May. To sum it up, FIFA stands out as a robust franchise through a tumultuous year in the videogame industry. We are making changes to improve execution and we're refocusing R&D investments to projects with near to medium-term returns without impacting our long-term vision. Meanwhile, we're looking forward to giving Star Wars fans the opportunity to live the life of a Jedi in Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, to continue to innovate our ever-popular PvZ brand, and deliver another action-packed installment of Need for Speed. And now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. The gaming industry is strong, and it continues to grow. New genres have emerged and become massively popular. Free-to-play is reaching across more platforms and geographies. Subscriptions and cloud gaming are strong future growth opportunities. And above all else, great content continues to be the lifeblood of our industry. As Blake and I have talked about, we are experiencing a difficult second half of FY19. We're disappointed with our underperformance. We are confident in our overall strategy, but we are making deliberate changes to our organization, our operational processes, and our creative focus to address our challenges. Importantly, we are confident and excited by our incredible portfolio of strong brands, our talented teams, our commitment to live services, and our pipeline of new games. We have a slate of EA SPORTS titles that have performed well even in light of increased competition this year. FIFA in particular continues to demonstrate its leadership as a top title in the industry, and it is growing as a business. We will build on the continued success of our EA SPORTS portfolio with significant innovation and new ways to play in FY20. We have our deepest line-up of new IP in more than a decade. We're very excited about the opportunities we have with Apex Legends, Anthem, and Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order in the year ahead. We're also set to bring new games and live service content to some of our fan-favorite franchises. In FY20, we will have new games for our Need for Speed and PvZ shooter fans. We plan to bring a lot of great new content to the passionate and growing player base in The Sims 4, and we're focused on exciting more Battlefield players with upcoming additions to Battlefield V. We will also double down on live services in our top mobile franchises, while pushing forward with new projects and taking the necessary time to set them up for success. Our belief remains strong that the combination of subscriptions and streaming will be transformative to the future of gaming, and we are well-positioned for that evolution. Earlier this fiscal year we added a new frontline tier to our subscription offerings for PC players, and in the year ahead we plan to offer a subscription service on another major platform. We have a lot of great content coming in FY20, and we're excited for more players to experience it through our subscription programs across more platforms. Our industry is growing, and we know expectations for EA are high. As we take action to address our challenges, our underlying business is strong, our pipeline is robust, our teams have amazing talent, and we're confident for the future. With that, Blake and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Mike Ng : Great, thank you for the question. I have two, just one for Blake and one for Andrew. Blake you mentioned that given the more tempered view on growth for next year, EA is making some hard choices out of investments that you're making, you discussed some of the things that you\u2019re focused on but I was just wondering if you could give us little bit more color on areas of the business that you may be pulling back on? And then for Andrew, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the premium Battlefield Title for next year, it seems that in fiscal 2020 Respawn will now be operating or launching three titles between that one, Apex, and Star Wars, could you just talk about Respawn capacity for that? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : So on the investment side, our view is we need to constantly be looking at the performance of all of our different lines of business and where those lines are performing as well as we want. We are focused on making some changes. We are focusing also on the pace of some of the investments, we're not changing our strategy, we're still following the notion that we\u2019re building a subscription and a network world that's prepared for both the existing platforms and future platforms like streaming. It's just the question of the pace. We want to make sure that we're very focused on the most important thing which is great content. Without great content delivery models like subscription or platforms like streaming don't mean very much. So I think, think about our approach as trying to double down on making sure we're building and delivering content and great live services experiences across console, PC, and mobile. Andrew Wilson : On the second point, you mentioned Battlefield, I think it was tight and full that you\u2019re referencing. We have continued to invest in Respawn, on which Respawn did the acquisition. They now have two fully stocked teams one focused on the shooter genre and one focused on action adventure. They also have the benefit of a lot of EA scale and central resources, groups like EA Digital Platform, content development services which is kind of content and Q&A, security publishing et cetera. And well, I don't have more to share on the particulars of what would come in for Titanfall. What I would say is Respawn are a tremendously creative team, they always anticipated that Apex Legends would be a spectacular game in the Battle Royale genre and that they would use that as a ramp point to continue to innovate and deliver a truly creative take on what Titanfall is in a premium context later on the EA. Blake Jorgensen : And I\u2019ll answer that first just looking at Apex Legend should give view a context of what a superior set of game developers sit in Respawn. This team of people is exceptional and the type of game they've built and the innovative level of that game. And second, you'll start to see in the next few months glimpses of the Star Wars game and I think you'll be blown away by what you see. We've played 20 plus minutes of it last week and it is exceptional in terms of its like level of polish depth and what living inside of the Star Wars world is a Jedi and I think people will be blown away by. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great, thank you. We think about Battlefield two years ago is a runaway hit and it wasn't very competitive and then this year obviously Battlefield V this. Just can you talk about a little bit how much you attribute to really the competitive dynamics versus game execution and how can EA improve execution on its titles going forward so that you don't have that misses like the last two years. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : I think it's a really good question. And I think that there is certainly an element of the market and competitive nature of the market that amplified or magnified so much challenges we've had. If I think about Battlefield 5 more holistically, I think we did not do a great job of building momentum early in the project. And I think about this not just in the context of development but I think about this in the context about broader execution against the entire campaign. Our launch didn't resonated strongly as we would have liked it to with players and we were never truly able to catch-up and as our competitors continued to build momentum whether that was Fortnite or Red Dead Redemption 2 or Call of Duty we continued to kind of store from where we needed to be. I think you combine that with a move of the title, again I think that we made the right decision to move the title and service of the quality of the game and on balance those that bought into the game really enjoyed it and the game was better for that move. But the combination of a poor start in our marketing campaign together with what I think was a longer development cycle that put us into a more competitive window and the amplification that competitive window against some of those underperformance factors is how we resulted in Battlefield. What I can tell you is we've gone back and we just completed our global publishing and marketing meeting for the year ahead, just last week. And part of what we have done there it's having far more real conversations early on. Getting the center of not just the production cycle of the game but what is the craving center and how we bring that game to market. And you should expect that we will be more innovative and more creative around both AL marketing campaigns and how we bring games to market and more diligent in our operation against execution of the project plans around development of video games on a go-forward basis. I mean something we are taking very seriously across the full -- the full landscape of development. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Eric Handler : Thank you very much and just a follow-up to Justin, he brought up some good points, how big of an issue do you see with marketing and significant changes need to be made here as you think about particularly marketing in the holiday quarter we saw you had issues several years back with Titanfall 2, despite the fact that was a good game from a ratings perspective. You had decent ratings for Battlefield V and maybe you could talk about what needs to change with marketing or is it just date selection, how are things going to evolve there? And then as a follow-up maybe you could talk about your mobile strategy in the past, has been more of choosing to go for singles and doubles. And in this environment can singles and doubles still work or do you have to go for the big home runs there? Andrew Wilson : Okay. There is a lot in there. Let me start with marketing. I think what you have seen from us is some tremendous marketing across our portfolio, it is how FIFA was able to rise in the way it did through the year, it's how our sports franchises even in the phase of stiff competition still performed well. What I think when we go back and analyze what happened with Battlefield V and Titanfall 2, I think we failed to come to a true creative center of a campaign that was compelling for players. And we spent too long getting to that point. And by the time we got to lunch and we didn't have that creative center for the campaign, we had lost ground against that competitors. Our holiday quarter will always be competitive, in the past we have competed very well. What we have seen this year is that, we had some big misses early on and they gained momentum in terms of the impact ahead of our business over time. As I just talked about with Justin's question, what we have done is gone back and built a formal robust process around how we find our creative center, it's called the reason to play and Chris Bruzzo, our CMO, and his entire organization have restructured the entire marketing conversation from the inception of game development through full campaign. And we expect that will put us in a significantly better position on a go-forward basis. In the context of mobile and I think what you heard from us the prepared remarks is mobile is a tremendously powerful market place, it's a growing market place but we are seeing that it's getting harder and harder to break into that market. What we are seeing is that many, many thousands of games are launching and that only a few are finding success. And even great games are failing to break through. What we're also seeing however is that two things are becoming true. One is that additional focus on existing live titles can deliver tremendous profitability over time and you should expect that we will do that. We're also seeing that patience is important. Some our competitors are having their games in the market for 12 months or 18 months and building and adjusting to drive growth in that space, and you should expect that from us also. But what you did hear from us is that we will be focusing on best team on the big opportunities because in order to breakthrough gamers expect not just a really big brand, not just innovation in gameplay but they expect really big gameplay proposition and part of what we doing on a go-forward basis is focusing on some of those much bigger opportunities. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I'll just remind people that sports like it is in our core console and PC business is a critical component of long-term success in mobile I think life today we've generated over $1 billion in sports business and the beauty of that business is evergreen, it restarts every year and we're trying to continue to grow that with FIFA, with Madden, with NBA around the globe and that's the focus that we're going to continue to step into and trust we don't step up thinking we're going to hit a single or double we\u2019re always focused on trying to hit home runs and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hi, thanks gentleman. Can you talk about how cross play, cross progress is expected across the portfolio? And then, in particular, I see you're limiting either Apex or Anthem's potential. And then secondly, Andrew talked a lot about competition, one way to kind of solve increased competition is M&A. So could you talk about any updated thoughts on M&A? Thank you guys. Andrew Wilson : So again, we think the cross play and cross progress is going to be a very important part of that future, and you should anticipate that we'll be doing more in that space. What AL information would suggest to us is that there is an tremendous amount of play across devices but that overrule liquidity in any gaming community is a good and positive thing even if it\u2019s only a few people or small portion of the community that utilizes that. We absolutely are looking to that in the context of Apex and we'll be looking at that across our portfolio with time and we think about franchises with tremendously large communities like FIFA and think that they would absolutely benefit from cross play and cross progress as more and more people come into these big communities. Blake Jorgensen : And on the M&A front, we're always looking at virtually every opportunity that comes through. I think Respawn presents an example of how it's worked extremely well for us, we've had great integration with their company and we're obviously seeing the fruits of that now and will continue through the next year and longer. Our view is continue to stay close to everyone, be in dialogue, so if there is opportunities that come up we're looking at those opportunities, we're always going to be focused on creating value for shareholders in our M&A discussions and sometimes private companies expectations on valuation don't match the public realities in the marketplace particularly in this last year as public market valuations have change dramatically for ourselves and others in the industry that hasn't necessarily been reflected again in some of the prior market valuations but we think over time that might and we want to make sure we're looking for some of the great properties that we know are out there and we're going to continue to do that. And part of the reason we're continuing to maintain the cash balance and the capital structure that we have is to be in a position to be at the table for any of those great properties that might come to market in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Thanks. So I guess Andrew bigger picture Qubole is working on a streaming platform, Amazon also seems to be doing the same, I would presume Apple probably has ambitions here as well, so it seems like you as a content producer will have a lot more distribution outlets and optionalities from who will be wanting your content on their platform. So can you give us some perspective on how your distribution costs or I guess the platform royalties may change over time and how quickly that may change? And Blake can you give us a little bit more color on where you are in transitioning the FIFA Online 3 users to FIFA Online 4, where the status is that -- where the status of that is in between Korea and China as well as what may be the latest feedback from your distribution partner in regards to the regulatory environment in China? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Okay. I'll take the first one, you're right. There are a number of people or a number of entities working on streaming technology. We believe that is a good thing to the extent that we can massively increase the total addressable market of gamers and get to a point where 2.5 or 3 billion gamers exist, and they currently play in more devices can play in almost every device they own. We think that is a great thing. We also have technology that we have been developing internally that we think will actually be able to accelerate that through our partners and accelerate our ability to reach more customers through cloud service and cloud gaming. In terms of kind of platform growth, I think it's too early to tell what we're seeing right now with some of the players in the marketplace and it seems to be a competition for who can charge content creators less money to distribute their content. I don't know what that net out, I think that will be good for us over time. I also think that increased total addressable market, our potential for more liquidity platform royalty structure combined with our ability to offer a robust subscription offering to many, many hundreds of millions or even billions of players over time represents a very, very big and strong opportunity for our future. Blake Jorgensen : On Online 3 to Online 4, I think Korea, as Andrew mentioned, moving people faster from 3 into 4 and starting to grow 4. China, we are being more cautious along with our partner Tencent but some of the regulatory hurdles are starting to get cleared across the industry which I think will help us speed up that transition from 3 into 4. I was hoping that it would be fully transitioned by the end of this quarter and clearly if not, we think it's going to probably continue at least through the next quarter or maybe early next year but we do view that the long-term play there is a positive one particularly with the growth of soccer in that marketplace. Stephen Ju : Okay, so Blake, just as a clarification when you talk about next year clarification, it's your fiscal year not calendar? Blake Jorgensen : Yes, fiscal year exactly. So we will give you more update when we talk next quarter but my hope is it's not a headwind for us next year and actually becomes a tailwind for us. Stephen Ju : Understood, thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Fiscal year, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Cohen from Stifel. Jeff Cohen : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about what kind of operating margins we could see on the revenue that you expect from Apex Legends versus the revenue you get from a normal upfront game sell, I think it should be higher given that it's all digital? And then if you guys could give us some guidance in terms of maybe how to think about the sizing the potential for that game, that would be great as well? Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I mean both of those are pretty hard after one day only because we don't have a lot of areas to look to that actually pegged, it's different business than say our largest Live services Ultimate Team. Ultimate Team you have people are predisposed to spend because they bought the base game coming in, so the payer ratios I think as we've talked about are much higher than what you would see in a pure free to play game like a mobile game where they are in single-digits. Our hope is obviously we have high engagement and high number of users and the combination of those two things should drive what we believe is very profitable revenue, you are correct having all digital and having that come through either directly, our origin platform where there's no platform fees or through third-party platforms will help depend on what the ultimate profitability is but I think overall it should be very strong. It's just hard for us to size that market more to come on that over the next couple of months as we get closer to doing guidance for next year. As I said we put very little revenue into this quarter four because we just didn't know but by the time we give guidance in May, we will have a much better sense of what we think that will be based on the number of users coming in and then those users that are spending across the Live Services that will continue to roll out. Andrew Wilson : Well it is early, what I can say is that in the first 24 hours we had over 2.5 million unique users trending past towards 3 million unique users and nearly 600,000 peak and current users kind of in the middle of a Tuesday, so it's very early but the response to the game has been very, very strong. We've been the number one views game on Twitch since launch and player sentiment seems to be very, very high right now. Jeff Cohen : Thanks guys. Yes the game definitely seems to be off to a strong start, will that revenue run through the live services line in the model? Blake Jorgensen : Most likely, yes. Jeff Cohen : Okay. Blake Jorgensen : So you probably see obviously some growth there next year, if it's additive and successful which we think it will be, I think as Andrew was saying we're very excited about it, it's just so early, we don't want to put too much into the model yet and it's really not built when I gave that guidance earlier on low-single-digit or mid-to-low-single-digit for the total business that doesn't really anticipate a huge number for our live service business yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie. Ben Schachter : Hey Blake, I was wondering if you could just talk about the use of cash a bit more, you talked about M&A but given where the stock is should we think it would be more active in buyback? And then Andrew maybe you could talk a bit about China, is FIFA really the only opportunity for you guys there or should there be anything else, just any broad comments on Fortnite and how that's impacting you guys and the big holiday? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I will start Ben on the buybacks. I mean, we are two-thirds of the three quarters way through the first year of our $2.4 billion program which is a double of the last program, we've doubled our pace of buybacks and we're tracking to that. We will, as we have done I think consistently over the last few years review the buyback with our board at the end of our fiscal year and determine if we should continue on existing buyback or if we should increase it and that will be based on what our outlook is for the future as well as the cash flow generation. We spend less time focused on what the current stock price is, we want to be in the market every single day which we are and track to the buyback that we've made the commitment to the Street and we'll look at reviewing that each quarter as or -- each year as we near the end of the fiscal year so more to come when we give guidance again. Andrew Wilson : And on China, I think as everyone would acknowledge, China is a very particular marketplace. We certainly see robust growth opportunities for FIFA but we also know that we did a small partnership deal around Command & Conquer mobile game recently that is performing very, very well in China. We know that the Plants vs Zombies brand is very strong in China as is the Need for Speed brand. And as that market continues to evolve and mature, we are seeing that brands like FIFA, brands like Need for Speed, Plants vs. Zombies, Command & Conquer and potentially The Sims, may have tremendous appeal there and working through plans on how we execute against that over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel. Drew Crum : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Can you talk about your expectations for live services going forward, it was fiscal 3Q the bottom and would you expect to see improvement in the out quarters and if so what are some of the drivers for improvement? And I guess separately on Anthem, you were pretty upbeat coming out of the last earnings report being three weeks away from launch having gone through the beta testing, have your expectations for the launch changed in any way and if so how and why? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So on live services remember it's a collection of items as we mentioned FIFA, Ultimate Team has largest quarter in history in Q3, Madden's continued to grow strong the counter is the offset in Battlefield 1 live services which are dying down as the tail of that live service is coming down. And we yet to ramp up Battlefield V live services and I don't, as I mentioned we don't have a large number in there for monetization on Battlefield or Anthem live services because we just don't know yet how those will perform. We're cautious that we want to not put too much revenue in until we really see that revenue. So hard to say now our goal is to continue to grow live services obviously and we think Ultimate Team still has a lot of room to grow and some of the things that we're doing with both the FIFA and Madden for next year should help continue to drive with Ultimate Team growth in those two products as well as I just mentioned possibly some upside from Apex and Battlefield V and Anthem. In terms of Anthem outlook, I think I mentioned five to six million units which is consistent with how we thought about it last quarter and we are comfortable with that based on what we're seeing and outcome of the demo. Both demos lot of excitement around and lot of interest people are realizing it is a game that's unlike any other game they've ever played. The opportunity to work with different suits, to fly, to go into the water I mean it is fabulous mechanics as you're playing the game, and people are enjoying it quite a bit. And so more to come as we learn more but we think there is a great opportunity not just this year for that game but that should sell well for a long period of time as we add more content through the live service plan. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick Johnson : Hey, good afternoon. I was hoping that you could talk about the in-game monetization strategies to be employed in Apex? Also any metrics that you can give us on Origin Access Premier help to understand your progress there. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : So again, Apex is a free-to-play game and so many players may choose and continue to play all the way through the game and earn in-game currency so that they can level up and buy new unique cosmetic items for their character in their world. There's going to be a couple of different modernization opportunities inside of Apex. There will be a revolving direct purchase option that will allow you to buy cosmetic items and at times buy new legends. None of those items will give you an advancement in play is not a play to win mechanic. It's really about differentiating game play and differentiating how you look in a world of a big and robust community. In addition to that there will be Apex packs which is similar to a loot box mechanic where should you not wish to purchase direct, you can go in and buy items as part of a loot box mechanic. There will be repeats in that. So there's a whole system to insure that you always get something of value and again all will be cosmetic and in places you will get things through the loot box mechanic that are at a cheaper rate than buying through direct purchase. The Respawn team have been very, very thoughtful around it, they've looked at a lot of great monetization strategies throughout the game industry. They've come at this with the opportunity to allow players who got to play the entire game for free, if they so choose, to direct purchase to get the things directly that they want, if they so choose all to use a loot box mechanic to experience that surprise and delight would have built in buffers and backups to ensure that players always receive something of value and that players aren't getting a whole bunch of duplicates through that system. I'm actually really proud of what team has done and I think what we're seeing from early feedback from players is that they're on to something really special that's wide variety of users again. We expect that many, many tens maybe at some point hundreds and millions of people will look play this game and it was important for them to think through it, they are completely proud of where they got to. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark. Mike Hickey : Hey Blake, Andrew. Thanks for taking my questions, guys I appreciate it. Andrew Wilson : You bet. Mike Hickey : First I guess on Apex Legends, I guess congrats what an awesome deal, it's really hard to be surprised and your marketing efforts there were -- from Respawn were definitely exceptional buzz is high, I guess looks like Respawn also has a fair amount of work done on a content roadmap we have sustained some engagement, I was curious how you think maybe longer-term in extensions Mobile Asia, esports related to Apex in the Battle Royale genre. And also curious if you feel that there might be a tension between the Battlefield, Battle Royale experience and one that you just served with Apex Legends? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Great question. First is that Apex Legend is being built from the ground up with a view that it has the potential to engage and entertain hundreds of millions of players. And when you look at the game and I was watching being streamed early today, that's mesmerizing to watch. When you watch great players like Ninja playing the game, it's pretty special and exciting to watch, one of the more exciting games I have ever had the fortunate viewing. And so you can see very clearly as you watch and you play the game, that there are going to be opportunities to take the game in different directions over time. esports will almost certainly be part of that additional game modes, the impact of additional legends over time, great view content will have an impact. As I said earlier, we are looking at how to take the game to mobile and cross play over time. And I also expect that this game will have tremendous value in Asia and we're in conversations about that. Some of those conversations as you might guess are new. We took a very deliberate strategy around how to launch this game. Again in a world where we have not executed as well on some things through the past six months as I would have liked, I think the development of marketing teams executed against this extraordinarily well and surprised a global industry. The development team was very cautious about building a completely different game and wanted to make sure by the time they launched this game into the marketplace, it would surprise and delight players maybe how to play from day one. Our marketing team will also be very conscious that when you start talking about the innovative nature of this game, the core play, the squad play, the in-game mechanics, the communication system all the things that Respawn has done that we wanted to be very careful not to tip out hat or show our hand to the competition. We're going to come out with a truly innovative and creative game. And we also knew that the break into what it is a very competitive marketplace, we had to do something truly innovative with the launch. I think the teams have done a tremendous job there and you should expect that we had very big and robust plans for this game and it will branch in a lot of different directions over time. Blake Jorgensen : I just mentioned today in a tweet that they are planning on a premium product, we mentioned that today as well later in our fiscal 2020 that continues to evolve Title for our Universe. And I think there's a lot of exciting things on the roadmap that you'll learn more about in the coming months. Andrew Wilson : And to the second part of your question around Battlefield Firestorm, we think that these while they sit inside the Battle Royale kind of genre, two very different types of experiences. What we've seen is the community who want to play these types of games is hundreds of millions of people strong. We think there is an opportunity to deliver the fast-paced play that is Apex Legends and where that game goes to a big part of the community. And then also the strategic play, the vehicle play, the things are unique to a Battlefield Battle Royale mode will offer differentiation of play for a different part of that community, and at some level there may also be some cross over. But given the size of the community, given the very different types of gameplay even inside the Battle Royale genre, we believe those two modes can fit very well together in the community. Mike Hickey : I appreciate that. Andrew Wilson : One more question. Operator : Your last question comes from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies. Tim O'Shea: Yes, so thanks for squeezing me in, I just love to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons of free-to-play and how full price games can perform in an environment where AAA content is given away for free. You obviously mentioned in the intense competition and looking at the fiscal 2019 outlook packaged goods which seems like a decent proxy for full price, it does imply a sharp step down here and just maybe a follow-up but what do you think is the right mix of business models going forward, we sort of articulate your vision around streaming games being streamed from the cloud, we heard you articulate a vision around subscriptions and now you surprised us with this big free-to-play game. Thank you for the questions. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I think remember the packaged goods decline is really just that digital shift and the shift towards more and more parts of our business having Live services. I think the issue around free-to-play is to make a free-to-play game work well, you have to have a huge audience, we believe Apex has the potential of that but there are many games out there that sell anywhere between 3 and 7 or 8 million units that are very successful games but those audiences aren't big enough to support a free-to-play game like you see in Mobile for example. Typical mobile games we see 80, 90 million downloads of a client, that's how you make a mobile game work and a free-to-play economics work. We always believe there's going to be multiple models. There has been for many years, Asia's been primarily free to play but big games and big marketplaces but as you look at some of the more successful action oriented games of this past year like God of War, Spider Man, those are games that most likely aren\u2019t free-to-play style games because they're not big enough to sustain those types of economics and we think people want to consume games in different way, some through purchase, some through subscription, some through streaming purchase, or streaming subscription, and some through free-to-play models across many different platforms. So we think it's a great way to continue to grow the industry, we think Fortnite help grow the industry another free-to-play games and this is an opportunity for us to try to participate at it. Tim O'Shea: Thanks Blake. And also -- Blake Jorgensen : Go ahead, sir. Tim O'Shea: I was just going to say thank you for the additional disclosure to this quarter. Blake Jorgensen : Okay, good, thanks. Blake Jorgensen : And I hope we had a chance to talk to everybody in the coming days and I appreciate everybody's time and we will talk soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Natalie, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Christopher Evenden : Thanks, Natalie. Welcome to EA's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are : Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, July 30, 2019. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 7, 2019, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Note that our results reflect our adoption of ASC 606 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. And for more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we have posted on our IR website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. The last year was a period of growth in our industry, and one of significant change as transformation accelerated and player behaviors evolved. Throughout our FY2019, we saw strength in our business and our portfolio, and achieved some powerful milestones in our top games and services. We were also challenged by some things that did not go as we planned. Our learnings are helping us sharpen our execution, and we now have key opportunities to drive growth in the year ahead. Overall, our player base grew to more than 500 million active player accounts in FY2019. This was driven by engagement in our top franchises and live services on major platforms, as well as the introduction of new IP including the free-to-play game Apex Legends that helped us reach new audiences around the world. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here. The strength of our EA SPORTS business in FY2019 was powered by some of the deepest and most innovative games that we\u2019ve ever delivered to our fans. In a year where we had great experiences in both FIFA 18, including World Cup content, and FIFA 19 with the UEFA Champions League, we had more than 45 million unique players in total playing FIFA games on console and PC during FY2019. More than a hundred million more players engaged with our FIFA franchise on mobile and PC free-to-play during the year, as well. FIFA Ultimate Team continued to show strength, and our competitive modes like Weekend League saw engagement double year-over-year. We\u2019ve had greater than 60% growth year-over-year in total unique views, and more than half a billion minutes watched, of our FIFA Global Series content \u2013 and some of our biggest tournaments of the season are still to come. We\u2019ve seen similar trends in our Madden NFL franchise. Players are staying engaged in Madden NFL 19 for longer, our Madden Ultimate Team business grew year-over-year, and Madden competitive gaming is driving excitement and viewership of the franchise. Our season-ending Madden Bowl tournament was broadcast directly from our new in-house studio here in Redwood Shores to ESPN2 and digital channels, and garnered 7x as many peak concurrent viewers as last year\u2019s event. We\u2019re proud of how we\u2019re delivering for EA SPORTS fans on all platforms, bringing the authenticity, immersion and competition that players are looking for all year round. On February 4, we surprised the world with Apex Legends, an all-new free-to-play Battle Royale game from Respawn. The creativity, innovation and fun of this game set it apart immediately, and the fluid gameplay mechanics delivered a core experience with the excitement and competition that players around the world had been craving. Apex Legends is the fastest-growing new game we\u2019ve ever had, quickly reaching the milestone of 50 million players, and millions more have continued to join. It has also helped us tap into new player audiences, as nearly 30% of Apex Legends players are new to EA. We\u2019re incredibly excited and humbled by the passion that fans around the world have for Apex Legends. We\u2019re now very focused on delivering for this massive global community with a long-term live service, including new seasons with more robust Battle Pass content, new legends, and exciting evolutions to the in-game environment. We\u2019re also working aggressively to bring the game to more players in more markets and platforms around the world, including Korea where we saw an opportunity in the market and self-published Apex Legends via Origin. We are still at the very beginning of this exciting journey with Apex Legends, and we look forward to sharing more as we go, including the first details of Season 2 at EA PLAY in June. We also expanded the Battlefield V experience in Q4 with the arrival of Firestorm, our first Battle Royale mode in a Battlefield game. The DICE and Criterion teams built the biggest map in franchise history and brought signature elements of Battlefield gameplay into this 64-player survival mode. In the first week after launch, Firestorm became the biggest Battlefield live service event ever, with nearly 60% growth in active players\u2019 week-over-week. We\u2019re currently in the middle of our third chapter of live service updates to Battlefield V, with more chapters set to begin in the summer and fall, each bringing more of what fans are looking for with new maps and missions. We\u2019ll showcase some of the great new experiences coming to Battlefield V at EA PLAY. We are similarly committed to the live service for Anthem, and delivering for our community in this new IP over the long-term. The launch of Anthem in Q4 did not meet our expectations. However, we believe in the team at BioWare, and we also believe in what they set out to achieve with this game \u2013 building a new IP and melding genres to reach a new audience. Players have spent more than 150 million hours in Anthem since launch, and we\u2019ve heard from them that the beauty and expanse of the world is stunning, and that traversing the environment in the Javelin suits makes for amazing gameplay. However, we\u2019ve also heard feedback from our community about issues that began to manifest as the game reached scale, and that they want more depth and variety in the mission modes of the game. The team is now very focused on continued improvements to the game, and will then bring more content updates and in-game events that will enhance and expand the Anthem experience. As we wrap up FY 2019, I also want to highlight the continued success of The Sims 4, which has grown every year since we launched. We launched three new content packs and multiple game updates for our Sims 4 community throughout the year, all of which contributed to a 35% year-over-year increase in active players and our strongest year of engagement yet for this ongoing live service. The passion of our Sims community is incredible, and we look forward to bringing them many more great experiences in the year ahead. Looking to FY 2020, we see an exciting year ahead. Across HD platforms, mobile and PC, the global gaming audience is growing. Great games and services will continue to be at the center, and we are focused on bringing new experiences to more players on more platforms in more geographies throughout the year. The variety of new games and experiences that we\u2019re planning for players this year demonstrates the breadth and depth of our portfolio. We will have new titles and experiences in our biggest sports franchises, FIFA, Madden NFL, NHL and NBA LIVE, bringing innovation and excitement to hundreds of millions of EA SPORTS fans around the world. We\u2019re set to deliver on some of the biggest requests that we\u2019ve had from our communities, including new experiences and gameplay advancements that will more deeply immerse players into the world of their favorite sports. For Star Wars fans, Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order will deliver an amazing single-player adventure, launching in the same window as the movie this holiday. Need for Speed returns to consoles and PC this year, revitalizing the street racer versus cop fantasy at the core of the franchise. We\u2019ll have a new Plants vs. Zombies HD shooter title, fun and irreverent as always. On mobile, we\u2019ll have new titles going into early user testing this year, ensuring that we\u2019re giving players more time to test and give feedback before we go live globally. And our support of the indie developer community will continue with Sea of Solitude. We are also deeply committed to our live service communities, delivering more content and more ways to play, watch and create. With the growth of Apex Legends, the team at Respawn is fully focused on live service with a cadence of big new seasonal content launches and continual updates and adjustments to the experience throughout the year. We\u2019re set to deliver 20 new content drops and expansion packs this year for our thriving Sims community on console, mobile and PC. We have robust live service plans for Anthem and Battlefield V, and we\u2019ll also continue delivering new content for Star Wars Battlefront II, where our commitment to the game has enabled us to build a very strong community over time. Our competitive gaming programs will continue to be a major focus as well, with our competitive modes in FIFA and Madden, global tournament ecosystems, and high-quality esports programming set to grow our audience of players, viewers and sponsors. We are working to bring more great games and content to our players where they are. Subscriptions are a key element of this approach to provide players with more choice, and we will expand our subscription offerings to include more games and more platforms in FY2020. In our Origin subscriptions on PC, there are over 200 games from EA and outside developers, and that will continue to grow. As we announced this morning, we are bringing our EA Access console subscription to players on the Sony PlayStation 4 this summer. We\u2019re now positioned to offer a subscription on more platforms than any other publisher, and we\u2019ll look to add to that in the coming year. We have a lot ahead of us in FY2020. We are committed to our players, and we\u2019re excited to be pushing forward with our plans. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. To echo Andrew\u2019s comments, the last 12 months have been a time of change for the videogame industry. Nevertheless, we ended our fiscal year with strong growth, driven by our live services businesses which continued to provide a very large, stable and profitable source of net bookings. We significantly outperformed our expectations in Q4. This was, of course, largely driven by Apex Legends, but sports were also stronger than we had anticipated. Anthem underperformed our expectations. I\u2019ll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare this quarter\u2019s results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $4.95 billion, cost of revenue $1.32 billion, operating income was $996 million, delivering EPS of $3.33. These results enabled us to deliver operating cash flow of $1.55 billion and return over a $1 billion to shareholders, about 83% of free cash flow, through our ongoing share repurchase program. Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $4.94 billion. Digital net bookings accounted for $3.72 billion of this. Live services net bookings were a record $2.41 billion, up 10 percentage points year-on-year. Within that, Ultimate Team showed its worth as a stable source of net bookings, growing 5% year-on-year. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter : GAAP net revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, above our guidance by $75 million. Operating expenses were $766 million, $51 million above our guidance, driven by tactical marketing investments in the launch of two major new franchises, and by variable compensation. Operating income was $196 million and resulted in earnings per share of $0.69, $0.13 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $599 million, down $16 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $35 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $564 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $301 million. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.45 billion. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings were $1.36 billion, well above our guidance of $1.17 billion, and up from $1.26 billion last year. As mentioned, the beat was driven by Apex Legends and our sports titles, offset somewhat by Anthem. Digital net bookings were $1.19 billion, up 14% on the year-ago period, driven by strong digital sales of Apex Legends and Anthem. Digital net bookings represented 75% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 68% in the prior year. Live services net bookings were up 24% to $845 million, primarily driven by Apex Legends. This delivered the biggest year ever for live services at EA. FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams both closed the year very strongly. With regards to our subscription services, we continue to add subscribers, exceeding 3.5 million across PC and console at the end of the quarter, and we look forward to growing this meaningfully with the addition of EA Access to PlayStation 4. Mobile delivered net bookings of $135 million, down 23% year-on-year, with declines from aging titles across our portfolio not offset by growth from our new title, Command & Conquer: Rivals. Our mobile business remains highly profitable, delivering a contribution margin of over 40%. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $213 million, 10% higher than last year. Growth was driven by the launch of Anthem and by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. The Q4 mix benefited from the launch of Anthem, which, judging from sales so far, is the most digital game we have ever launched. Turning to our expectations for fiscal 2020. In dollar terms, we expect the gaming software market to grow 7% over calendar 2018, with mobile up 12%, console up 4% and PC flat. Guidance for 2020 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.4 billion, cost of revenue $1.3 billion and GAAP EPS of $8.56. The forecast for GAAP EPS includes a one-time tax benefit from the internal transfer of some of our intellectual property rights to our Swiss subsidiary, where our international business is headquartered. The final tax benefit will be at least $5 per share, but could add as much as $13 per share to GAAP EPS during Q1 fiscal 2020. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be 18% and we do not expect this transfer to impact our cash taxes nor our operating cash flow. With regards to cash flow, for fiscal 2020, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $50 million. This year we expect the headwind from FX to net income to also be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, we will launch four sports titles, and expect units to be slightly down, off of a very strong year for FIFA unit sales thanks to the World Cup. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order we are modeling in the range of 6 million to 8 million, the new Need for Speed title we expect to sell around 4 million units, in line with past performance of the franchise, and the upcoming Plants vs. Zombies shooter to sell in the low single-digit millions. Overall, net bookings for packaged goods and other are forecast to be approximately $1.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year, driven by the continued shift to digital. Digital net bookings are expected to contribute $3.9 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Further breaking down digital net bookings, we expect live services to grow 10% to 15%, led by Apex Legends, FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4. Turning to our subscription business, we expect subscribers to grow meaningfully from the addition of PlayStation 4, on top of some organic growth on existing platforms. Apex Legends is easily the fastest-growing franchise we\u2019ve ever had, and we hope to build a live service that entertains players for years to come. Given the exceptional nature of the game, it is appropriate to take a cautious approach to financial modeling. Thus we are forecasting net bookings in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Note that this assumes no contributions this year from any future mobile version, or a game in the Chinese market. As you build your model, remember that, although the game is free to play, we incur costs for all players. As a result, you should model gross margin in the low 80% range. As a live service, contribution margins are expected to be in the low 60%, above our corporate average. We are hugely excited about the future of Apex Legends. Players love it, with a Metacritic of 89 and an extremely high net promoter score. Engagement is strong, and we have big plans for the Legends and the world they compete in. We are in advanced negotiations to bring Apex Legends to China and to mobile, and we will update you on timeframes when those negotiations are concluded. We are self-publishing Apex Legends in Korea. The game offers an opportunity for us to build a direct connection with our players there, and we hope to be able to leverage this for other games. We are also forecasting further growth of our Sims 4 business, off of fiscal 2019, which was its strongest year ever, including the launch year. Finally with regards to live services, we expect FIFA Online to show year-on-year growth from Q2 onwards. With regards to our mobile business, our portfolio continues to contribute healthy profits. We will start early user testing for two new mobile games this year, in line with our intent to give our games more time in soft launch, and we are not modeling any net bookings from either of those games in fiscal 2020. As a result, we expect mobile to be down around 10% to 15% in fiscal 2020, with aging titles in the west partially offset by strength in Asia. Net bookings from full-game downloads are expected to be down 5% to 10%, driven by product mix, offset by the underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow in the very low single-digits per cent in fiscal 2020, as a result of continued tight expense control. Focusing on Q1, we\u2019re expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.1 billion, GAAP cost of revenue $188 million and GAAP EPS of $5.84. The one-time tax benefit mentioned earlier falls entirely within the first quarter. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $690 million. Looking ahead, we will continue to build on the changes we have made to our studio organization this year, in leadership, structure and processes. We recently launched Firestorm, Battlefield V's Battle Royale mode, and that brought over a million people back into the game. We continue to invest heavily in Anthem, with developers working on game quality, content, systems and game mechanics. It's great original IP and we've doubled down on the product. We are continuing to build out Apex Legends, and are finding creative ways to rapidly bring it to new markets. We will reach an extraordinary variety of players in our FY 2020 slate. We will launch sports games, a racing game, an action title and a first-person shooter. We will add over 20 different content drops for The Sims 4. We are delivering on our commitment to players with deep live services content for Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, Anthem and Battlefield. Reflecting the industry as a whole, our games encompass premium, free-to-play, subscription and hybrid business models. The breadth of our content served us well in fiscal 2019 and positions us well for the future. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. The future of this industry has never been more exciting and full of opportunity. We\u2019re deeply focused on strong execution against our FY 2020 plans, and delivering great entertainment for the ever-expanding audience of players around the world. We\u2019re building amazing new games from powerful franchise brands, including Star Wars, FIFA, Madden, NBA, NHL, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. For tens of millions of players around the world, we have extensive plans to evolve and add to the Apex Legends experience. Fans of Battlefield V, The Sims 4, and Anthem will have more great content and new ways to play in the year ahead. We\u2019re working on new projects in mobile to join our portfolio of large-scale live services, and taking the time in player testing to hone breakthrough experiences. Throughout EA Studios, our creative leaders and talented development teams are deeply focused on delivering quality and innovation to our players in each of these experiences in FY 2020, and much more in the years to come. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in services and engine technology powering the games and experiences to meet the changing needs of players. At the core is our best-in-class technology platform, which provides the foundational services to deliver ever-evolving, connected experiences at scale. In the year ahead, we are focused on optimizing our technology to our studio needs, leveraging cloud, A.I. and other tools to increase iteration speed for our developers, and enable faster time-to-player for our games and our communities. With great games and powerful services, we will provide new ways to play, watch and compete. Competitive modes are driving some of the deepest engagement from players in FIFA and Madden. As our major esports tournaments drive viewership records, we have expanded our own broadcast production capabilities, and we\u2019re continuing to partner with networks like ESPN and Twitch to reach broader audiences. Combined with new sponsorships and great brand partners that are connecting us to more fans around the world, our opportunity in the global esports movement continues to grow. These priorities will help us meet the needs of an expanding global player base. In the year ahead, we will seek to be where more of our players are, offering our games through more platforms, through more business models, and in more markets. We will deliver great games to players on console, PC and mobile in FY 2020, and with more choice in premium, subscription, and free-to-play models. We are already leading in subscription services on more platforms than any other publisher, and we have plans to expand that in FY 2020. And with excitement for global brands like FIFA and Apex Legends, we\u2019re also working aggressively to bring our games to new players in Asia through self-publishing and valuable partnerships. We\u2019re ready for another dynamic year of growth in the games industry. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Blake Jorgensen : Hi, Nat. We are ready for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Evan Wingren of Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan Wingren : Thank you. Just wondering on Apex Legends, if you could provide some early learnings from the game, how you're thinking about free-to-play models in future businesses? And then Blake, on the Apex Legends guidance for the year, if you look at the growth rates that you provided for the full-year for live services, it does seem like that you would expect the rest of your live service business within your guidance to be roughly flat to down slightly. Just wondering and trying to understand the moving pieces there. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : I\u2019ll take the first part and then I\u2019ll give Blake the second part. As you heard from our prepared remarks, we\u2019re overjoyed with Apex. Again, the team at Respawn has built with universal price from a global gaming community. But at the same time when you bring 50 million players or more in short order, you learn a lot of stuff and you learn about the dynamics that come up with scale, with access, with matchmaking, with cheating, with monetization, with content creation. And I'm proud to say that the Respawn team is a learning team and they are taking all of that and rolling that back in the game experience. And as we talked about, their focus is to ensure that at the very core of the game, the foundation of the game experience continues to be unbelievable fun, exciting and fair for all players, and they have big and robust playing to fulfill, again something we learned, what amounts to insatiable appetite for new content and new programming in the context of the game over time. With respect to how we think about that across our portfolio, again free-to-play is a powerful business model where you can bring tremendous amounts of people at the top of the funnel and ultimately social interaction and competition form the very center of the game play experience. And we will almost certainly have other free-to-play experiences in our portfolio over time where the game that we're looking to build fulfills that criteria. Huge plying population and social interaction and competition at the very core of the experience. There are many other types of experiences, particularly experiences like Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order that don't fit well into a free-to-play model. And as we think about broad offerings across premium free-to-play end subscription, we know that we are fulfilling broad and varied motivations of the global playing audience. And so there will be many other games that don't fit that business model that we still believe are really, really strong opportunities for us to entertain and engage the global reach of players. Blake Jorgensen : So on the second question, actually I'm not sure how you're doing your math because we do see growth across the Ultimate Team business for the year. We see growth \u2013 a small growth number for FIFA online in Asia, but most of that comes starting in Q2 as I mentioned. Slight decline in our Star Wars : The Old Republic business, and probably one or two other businesses where there's some offsets. But overall we're seeing growth. We should see more backend Ultimate Team growth versus front-ended because despite not meeting our expectations last year at World Cup, we still had a strong a World Cup Ultimate Team, particularly a strong second quarter Ultimate Team year-over-year. We will see probably some challenge in Ultimate Team in the second quarter as a comp, but should have a strong third quarter and fourth quarter. Overall, we're looking for growth across \u2013 live services across virtually all the quarters. The biggest challenge is going to be the fourth quarter where we\u2019ll be comping the first quarter of Apex from this past year. Evan Wingren : Great. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking the question. Just on Madden's Ultimate Team. You mentioned Blake, how FIFA and Madden closed the year very strong. I was curious if you sort of talk to what drove that strength? And then step back and how you think about ex-China FIFA Ultimate Team growth, just talk about sort of the keys to really reaccelerating that growth in the back half sort of beyond the comps? What's the strategy to get more and more payers and players? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So I think characterized Ultimate Team in any of our live services is driven by addition of new activities and content. Over the last 11 years we've gotten better every year at designing events in Ultimate Team that engage players who can effectively have more fun each year. And when they have more fun, they're liable to spend some more money along the way. This year for example, we added an activity in the fourth quarter around the young up and coming players and a global soccer and it was one of our most popular events of the year, really caught fire with people and we will clearly be continuing to tune that. In Madden, we've continued to tune events associated with esports as well as post Superbowl around things like the combine and draft and they've been very popular and one of Madden\u2019s best years we had ever. And so it's really the beauty of live services is it's a daily business. The teams respond to daily data about what consumers want and what they're doing and continue with the same path and that will be the same path we follow with Apex Legends, where we\u2019ll continue to have seasons where there will be new ways to play, new maps, new activities, new characters, new weapons. It is the beauty of the live service business that every day you wake up and think about what we can continue to add to this to make and allow people to have even more fun on deeper engagement. And that\u2019s very different than the traditional business and one which we believe is a much more predictable business and steady business over time. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Andrew, question for you. I mean, obviously we're in the new age of gaming, so things like Twitch kind of matter and it helps drive marketing, but how relevant do things like that matter to you once games are launched in and out and you\u2019re driving live services? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Again, Twitch have been a valuable partner for us and represents a significant engagement node for members of the playing community. And so I expect the Twitch will continue to be important part of gamers lives. In terms of Twitch viewer data or Twitch viewer numbers at any given time, it is one data point that we use. There are ebbs and flows and what streamers want to project in those ebbs and flows and what viewers want to see. A lot of that is around new content and new engagement models. And so we would expect that as we kind of go through the year, whether that\u2019s for Apex or FIFA, we will see ebbs and flows in Twitch viewer data, and we will match that with a broader engagement days that we see and a player sentiment that we get from interacting directly with our players and use that overall drive what is a more enhanced and engaging and extended and expanded player experience for each member of our playing community across each one of our games. Blake Jorgensen : Andrew, I'd add to that. Our experience in creating broadcasting content is getting better and better each year. We add a substantial investment this past year in buildings. As Andrew mentioned, building our own broadcast facility and the team built a world-class facility where we go directly to ESPN or other broadcasting partners that we have with the content that we've created. And it allows us to repurpose the studio for virtually any game we have, it set up as a Madden studio, but we could easily do it as a FIFA studio and Apex studio or whatever it might be. And it can be used not just for creating esports tournaments, but for creating broadcast content to essentially continue the development and excitement around our games and get people engaged. And so you're going to continue to see more and more of that as part of what we do. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Thank you, gentleman. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open. Eric Handler : Thank you very much. Blake wondered if you could talk a little bit about the origins subscription service that you're having. What is your view on that business for the year? And I'm not sure how much you have to invest on a fixed cost basis at this point, but is this a profitable business in your view for fiscal 2020? Blake Jorgensen : Without a doubt profitable, we wouldn't be doing it if we saw it as a profitable business. For us, we've continued to invest in the origin platform around network and player related tools, ways for players to engage with games easier \u2013 more easier discovery of better social tools around things like matchmaking, better tools around communicating, and you'll continue to see that evolution over the next couple of years. We have a long technology roadmap that our teams are focused on there. Making the look, the feel and the interaction much better, we're also trying to make sure we built some of those tools that could be used on other's platforms if those other platforms don't have those tools because our goal is to replicate subscription across any available platform, where we think it would benefit from a subscription. We know consumers want to consume games that way. We've continued our experiment where we'll continue our experiment this year with frontline titles. We had forefront line titles this year, FIFA, Madden, Battlefield and Anthem and we're continuing to collect data on exactly how that differs from the catalog titles and we're continuing to add third-party content. As Andrew mentioned, we have over 200 games in our origin, access program and some of those from great developers like Warner Brothers or other large third parties. And we'll continue to add those, because we think that's important for consumers. We think our scale is a far greater than anyone else in the industry, particularly scale AAA games. And that's going to be important to building that subscription base. And the addition of Sony is going to be a huge benefit to both Sony and ourselves around how to have more people playing more games through a subscription offering. So more to come we mentioned we're over $3.5 million subscribers across the current origin and EA access on Microsoft platform. We think that steps up this year on both organic growth as well as on a growth with Sony. But you'll probably see us approach other platforms in the future to try and have them involved. In particularly as streaming becomes more and more prevalent in the future, we think screaming and combination with subscription could be very powerful. Eric Handler : That's great. And just as a follow-up to that, I remember speaking this time last year, or well what you launched around E3, the hope was you felt the shooters would have a big impact on the subscription services, and obviously Battlefield and Anthem had their issues. What do you feel is driving the subscriptions now and as you look into fiscal 2020, what's going to be the key drivers of content for those service \u2013 for the subscription service? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. We hadn't built Madden for PC and 10 plus years, so it was probably the lowest driver because they're just not that many people playing Madden on PC. But we've, believe we'll continue to add to that platform because there's more people playing FIFA obviously. And many of those are starting to get a chance to play Madden because they've never played it before. And we'll see more people that are traditional shooter players play action games like Anthem and sports games that they may not have played before. And so we find that it takes time for people to get through what's in the subscription. In some ways it's daunting. There's so many games in there, but they start to settle into a pattern in which they play games that they really enjoy. And many times they're ones they've never actually played before. So we think continually adding, we'll update obviously this year with Madden and, and FIFA, and other titles to drive the subscription as well as third-party titles. And we'll continue to feed that content and make it easier to find that content in play with new tools for interaction between other players. And we think that will help drive the subscriptions. Andrew Wilson : The other addition to this is not unlike all the media and entertainment subscriptions, is that we will use the engagement that we see inside subscription to help us think about what new games should we partner with to bring to the sub. And what new games that we should greenlight internally, and you will likely see us over time, start to greenlight some smaller games that go into the subscription with a view to growing them into much larger games in the future. And so not only do we think this offers tremendous value to players from a monetary standpoint, we also think it offers tremendous value to payers because that allows them to really play the games they want to play, and in the future play games that they may otherwise never get to play, but for subscription. Blake Jorgensen : And to be clear, we're conscious that the investment in the subscription tool and network doesn't come cheap. And investment in third-party content where we usually share revenue could ultimately start to cap margins in the service. We're conscious that unless we can develop a more stable business and more predictable business, it probably doesn't make sense to hurt our margins. We're not going to do as some others have in the media industry overspend or spend a dramatic amount more on content that we're delivering or building ourselves. We're going to continue to deliver and build a content that we have been in the past and look for other partners to help us deliver content and see how it plays out with the consumers. And it's now small portion of our overall business. We think it can be a meaningful portion and ultimately impact and change the way that the financials come each year in a much more stable fashion. But we're still on that journey and we'll see how it unlocks in a world of streaming because that may dramatically change the number of people that have the opportunity to play games in this method. Eric Handler : Very helpful. Thank you both. Andrew Wilson : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a broader one. Away from your own subscription and streaming offering over the medium term, how are you thinking about either partnering or not with other potential streaming subscription models that might make themselves available to the video game industry broadly as you look out against distribution and getting a wider distribution for your product as possible? And the second part of the question, in a world where there was some product that\u2019s free-to-play, and others that are distributed via streamed models, could that mean that we end up with less marketing intensity broadly and higher ROI for the industry? We'd love if you could weigh in on that as well. Thanks so much. Andrew Wilson : Well, let me grab the first bit and then maybe Blake and I can share the second. We come at this with true guiding principles. The first guiding principle is one that has stood the test of time for Electronic Arts, which is we seek to be platform agnostic. We have done a tremendous job since our inception of partnering with any and old platform holders that we could deliver games in any way that we could. And part of that is as a result of our second guiding principle, which is to be where our players are and offer our players choice in how they engage. And so as we look out in the market, we're very excited about a number of new players coming into the industry, particularly players at scale have the ability to dramatically increase the total addressable marketed players and provide frictionless access to this tremendous entertainment that we create. We will continue to find our business on these two guiding principles, to be platform agnostic wherever possible and to provide player choice and be where players are at every possible moment. And we feel like that either in the context of what is likely going to be changing consumption models over time, will both be good for us as an organization and more importantly, the best for our players over time. Blake Jorgensen : On the marketing side, I think in the near-term there probably isn't a large impact because you're obviously trying to bring people into the subscription which requires marketing as well as people to understand the games as we normally do. I think over the longer term, our hope is it certainly does. If you are able to help people discover new games once they're inside the subscription, we believe that's probably less expensive to do, and most importantly eliminates one of the big barriers for players and that is the risk of that they're not going to like the title. We do know that there are people that buy games and only play them once or twice and the risk at first as do they want to try something new? When it does subscription, they think that that next game is for free. And so what we're trying to do is get people to actually or breakdown that barrier of trial, which we believe is subscription can do and it's certainly can do it in a far less cost than it is in a traditional model. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is open. Benjamin Schachter : Guys congrats on a good performance for the year. When talking about the viewership thing, so when you announced [indiscernible] you talked about the strategic value of YouTube for its gaming business and within that context, can you talk about how you're thinking about viewership, how you monetize it? Is it still primarily about promotion for the core or do you see more direct revenues from that? And related to that, how your relationship with YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and the others evolve? And then just separately, can you talk a little bit about how political trade talks with China might impact the video game business? Is there anything that that may change there? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : I\u2019ll let Andrew take the first one and then I\u2019ll try to attempt to take the second one. Andrew Wilson : Again, so in the context of viewership, the first thing we\u2019re seeing is that gaming is a more meaningful part of our player's lives than it\u2019s ever been. And in addition to playing the viewing of games is as important to them. And that's not a natural human beings with him watching people play sport for hundreds if not thousands of years. And for many people the playing of games is very core to their competitive juices being fueled. And so we're going to see more and more that viewership transcends participation and it becomes a growing part of what is players gaming life. In the broader conduct for us, it all amounts to wonderfully great content. And part of the reason why we build our own production facility here is because we do want to ensure that the content that our view - that our players are viewing is as higher quality as a possibly could be. And ultimately the combination of playing our games and watching our games and engaging in a vast amounts of content that we're able to create that is of deep interest to our players as game becomes more important to them. That will almost certainly add to the value of our overall network and our overall ecosystem in the same way that any content or media business which see value. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I would answer that. We look as Andrew mentioned with great partnership with Twitch. We also have a great partnership with YouTube. We've been using those platforms for obviously working with influencers and showing our content. The one thing I think where we have a difference in many of the other game companies do is we also have great partnerships with many of the sports leagues. And when you think about FIFA, that's a collection of some of the biggest sports organizations in the world and people like UEFA and the champion's league, the premier league and others, which are really global businesses now versus the regional businesses, they weren't historically. And so we're working with them to find ways to help them build their brands around the globe, which may be not just traditional video games, but combinations of video games and broadcasting opportunities where we're doing things like esports tournaments and others. So it's a huge potential for us down the road and we're very excited about it. In terms of China, it's a daily question in our mind when we see what tweaks come out each morning. So it's hard for us to gage. We've know what you think is I seen a very strong partnership with Tencent around FIFA and other games and of the marketplace and those games are both on the PC \u2013 traditional PC platform as well as mobile platforms in China. We built a good partnership with other players in other parts of Asia. We'll continue to do that. We haven't heard anything or seen anything that would imply pressure based on any of the current trade talks. And our hope is that whatever is discussed is it settled in a way which it helps us even deepen our partnerships with those players in those markets. Benjamin Schachter : Blake, can I ask one quick follow-up on that? Just the negotiations around Apex entering China? How were those negotiations different than from previous titles? Blake Jorgensen : I would say not really that different. I think as we get deeper and understand the market more, we may ask for things that we didn't ask for it before, but they're not all that know. It just remember Apex is what we're at 92 days into this and the first 30 days to 40 days we were trying to figure out how many people we could add each day on the tech side of the equation and what content they needed. And so it's taken us time to work with potential partners and everyone wants to work with us. So you're trying to go through the partnership discussions, but overall it's been very positive. Andrew Wilson : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum of Stifel. Your line is open. Andrew Crum : Thanks. Hey, guys. Blake, so the $300 million to $400 million for Apex bookings, you suggest remodel fiscal 2020. Any guidance you can offer in terms of quarterly phase in there. And then separately, I think there's expectations. There will be new console from Sony and Microsoft out over the next 12 to 18 months. How is that in any way influencing your planned R&D spend and margin guidance for the fiscal 2020? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. That's a good question. I would probably put more in Q3 through Q4 then in Q1. We've already given you a Q1 guide in total. So you could probably work through what it is because \u2013 we just released our first season at the start of the quarter. We haven't announced what our next season will occur, but you would assume that it's probably at the tail end or the front of the second quarter. We assume that each \u2013 all the new content that we add will continue to help build that revenue base. So \u2013 but we're guessing a little bit, because we don't have a lot of history here. So I would probably, it's not straight line is probably a little more weighted to the back half of the year. In terms of the new consoles, we're still in the discovery phase around what exactly that means. But we've tried to build our basic engine structures, so it is can be modified for new consoles or new technology fairly easily versus having it be built from scratch. As part of the reason, we went down the path of trying to build frostbite as one of our major engines inside the company. And as a reminder, if you go back, many years back \u2013 going from Gen 2 to Gen 3 was very expensive. But some of that was driven by was the first time we went to HD versus non-HD into the games themselves as well as going from still on very customized boxes. When we went from Gen 3 to Gen 4, our costs actually didn't go up at all. And that's because the boxes were designed on more standardized chipsets. You didn't have the HD probably you are already there. And I think we just got better and we had better technology. And so our focus is on how do we try to minimize the cost going to the next generation, will know more in the next time, I'm guessing two or three quarters as we get closer to exactly what's going to be out there. But our hope is that there's not a big impact. Andrew Crum : Okay, thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post : A couple of questions maybe first with Blake, just a lot of questions on Apex will then obviously a very strong starting. Congrats on that, but how has it been the last 45 days as far as you users and usage and spend? And then maybe one for Andrew, two years now in a row where we'd had the big first person shooter, holiday title, under perform expectations. How much is that due to fortnight and other competition versus execution and how are you thinking about Battlefield maybe a year and a half from now just making sure that's going to be a great title? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : So I would say we're still \u2013 we're not in a place where we're going to give out a lot of metrics. You can assume that, the first 30 days was off the chart, I mean, again because so many people were playing. Our average daily user base has come down slightly, but there's still a lot of people playing. And obviously the biggest challenge on spend is having enough things that people could spend money on. You got to create content for people to spend money on. So you probably should assume that our spend levels have come down, but we also have the new edition of the battle paths, which essentially you had a lot of spending around battle pass and then people use that as their currency for some period of time. So we're learning what those spend patterns look like. So not a lot of guidance to give you. I would say that we're still very happy with where it is a got a very consistent user base. And we're trying to keep people with new content and new ways to play and that's where the biggest focus is going to be as well as continue to make sure that the players experience gets better and better in terms of how they play? If there's any bugs in it. We've never had anything of scale at this level. I think our biggest concurrent user day in FIFA would be 1.5 million users. And here we saw concurrence that we're 5x to 10x that is some cases. And so it tests and so we're learning along the way, but everything has worked much better than we thought. And it's just a question of more content. And before Andrew answers your question, I'll just make sure to remind everybody we're not going to start giving guidance for fiscal 2021. We just gave guidance for fiscal 2020. So\u2026 Andrew Wilson : And so again you referred to a Battlefront II and Battlefield V. I think that at the end of the day, we've got to create right games and no matter what's going on in the marketplace, we have to create great games. I think Battlefront II on balance in it kind of hard to see through the midst of this, but on balance, Battlefront II was a great game. We made some missteps in the context of progression and monetization, which actually clouded, what was otherwise a really great game and with the ongoing commitment that the studio has had with the player community, it's now a really strong game with really strong player sentiment and we expect that will continue to do well. We should have had that done at launch, but we are a learning organization and we've continued to support that community. I think with Battlefield V, we were missing the Battle Royale mode at launch. I think the players really wanted that. That was certainly in the front of mind of a global FPS player community. Again, we've now launched Firestorm. We\u2019ll talking about 60% week-over-week engagement and the team continues to be very committed to Battlefield as well. Through all of that, other people are also going to make great games and whether that's Fortnite or it's Red Dead Redemption 2. That's no different for us than it's been certainly for the 20 years I've been in this company, there's always competition. The good news, of course is there's more and more players across more and more platforms, across more and more business models each and every day and more now than there have ever been. And so we see the opportunity as being bigger and more exciting than it's ever been. But at the very cold we must execute. And everything you've heard from us in our prepared remarks is that we are going throughout entire studio and marketing organizations and working on ensuring that we execute against the delivery of spectacular games and very clear communication with our players to ensure that we're delivering what they want and they know what's coming. Blake Jorgensen : We\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Barclays. Your line is open. Ryan Gee : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, going back to Andrew's comments on game development. Recurring item that we've seen this year with Anthem and in previous games from BioWare, were some publicly publicized technical hurdles at launch. And I think the solution has been to respond quickly and issue big day one or week one patches. So has that been something isolated to just EA? I think it's something your peers are doing as well. But from an outsider looking in, it seems like doing this, it should be in the QA roadmap and the trust earlier before impacts, your public perception and your financial performance. And maybe provide some context on the challenges of running these big online worlds, what's being done now on the back-end at EA to ensure your games play as expected at launch. And then especially with Stadia and xCloud from Microsoft, adding to the complexity of games going forward, what you guys are doing now on the back-end to really prepare for that future? Andrew Wilson : So first I would say it's very perceptive and insightful question. And the reality is it's not just an EA challenges and an industry-wide challenge. And as games get more complex both depth and breadth of game experience and you're moving from what was initially a BioWare game, which will be somewhere between 40 and 80 hours of offline play to 40 to 80 hours of offline play plus a 100 or 200 or 300 hours of older game that happens with new developed players at scale online. Traditionally, what has happened with these massively online games as you would go through a seed of the launch process, you would have soft launches and you have beta tests and we've been launching these types of games in Asia and there'll be four or five different kind of community tests that happened throughout the development process. And that brings kind of the QA component of what happens to these games at scale more forward. In the west that kind of comes [in the confidence] with typically how games has been marketed. And so what we're doing now inside the organization is saying, okay, typically the way we would have marketed games like this is on this drip feed approach of releasing new content over time, build up kind of the appetite and the excitement for the game and then launch the game and it would run. As games has gotten bigger that system isn't working as well as it has done in years gone by. And so what you should expect from us is that we \u2013 it's not just about changing the development process in the game, is not just about changing the QA process in the game, although both of those things are being changed dramatically inside of the organization right now. But it also comes down to changing how we launch games and how we rolled out and you should expect we'll start to test things like soft launches, the same things that you see in the mobile space right now and it also comes down to changing how we communicate with players. And our entire marketing organization now is moving out of presentation mode and into conversation mode and changing how we interact with players over time. So the day that we bring truly a global audience into play, we have strong confidence that one, the game is ready, two, that the infrastructure can handle the game at scale and three, that our players understand exactly what reasons they're going to be playing and how they\u2019re going to be playing both on the day of launch and over time. We think that we are in a really good position. I think that gets really hard, if you don't have scale to do this in this new world, until we feel very good about it. And over time we hope that we can lead from the front and help other developers and publishers change the way they do things as well. Blake Jorgensen : Great. Well thank you everyone for taking the time today. We'll look forward to seeing everyone at EA PLAY in July, if not before that or before June. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Christine. Welcome to EA's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks.

During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. We delivered a strong start to FY '20. Players were deeply engaged in our top franchises with growing communities reaching new peaks of engagement fueled by content and in-game events in our live services. As a result, our operating results significantly exceeded our expectations for the first quarter. We're thrilled by the great experiences that players are having in our games, and we're looking forward to delivering a lot more throughout the fiscal year. Interactive entertainment continues to grow and expanding global player base [indiscernible] and tailwinds for the industry. With this backdrop, the core drivers of growth for EA are the depth and breadth of our portfolio and IP, our expertise in live services, our leadership in subscriptions and competitive gaming that expands our reach and drives deeper engagement. We're also continually strengthening our foundation of great talent and technology. I'll touch on some of these drivers with a few highlights here. Let's start with Apex Legends. We have a massive global audience continuing to engage in this high-quality free-to-play experience. Apex has tremendous gameplay at its core and we've built it to have longevity as a live service that will continue to drive engagement over time. In our live service, we're delivering seasons of new content, a collection of new content and updates that begin to roll out at the start of each season and continue throughout the course of several weeks and months. We launched Season 2 in early July, including a robust Battle Pass offering, a new character and additions to the environment. And to date, it had outperformed our expectations with significant growth in daily and weekly active players. In each season, there are in-game events that are additional drivers of engagement such as the event coming in the next few weeks that will bring new content and deliver one of the most fan-requested features since the launch of Apex. There will be more updates and in-game experiences in the weeks to come for Season 2 and Season 3 is shaping up to be even bigger. All of these elements, the fantastic core gameplay, seasons of new content and additional in-game events are designed to continually excite and engage the Apex community over the long term. We're also expanding into additional growth opportunities for Apex Legends. Esports will bring new drivers of social interaction and competition to the Apex ecosystem. Interest from teams, broadcast partners and sponsors is strong and we've had great success with our first exhibition event, including a competition at the ESPYS that was broadcast on ESPN and ABC. We'll have around 8 teams from around the world participating in our first official competition in September. Our plan is to bring Apex Legends to China and a worldwide mobile launch are also on course, and we will share more on our plans in the future. In our EA SPORTS portfolio, our franchises like Madden NFL and FIFA are delivering for core fans, innovating to reach new players and leading our growth in esports. Looking first at Madden NFL. We continue to see deep year-round engagement in the franchise. Live service events and tie-in content with the NFL Draft drove growth in new players joining Madden NFL 19 in Q1 and also deepened engagement in Madden Ultimate Team. We're now just days away from launching Madden NFL 20. The innovation in this year's game like the new Superstar X-Factor abilities, new personalized career campaign and the more fluid core gameplay are all designed to appeal to new and existing football fans. Madden NFL esports also continue to drive growing viewership. Players in our Madden NFL competitive ecosystem engaged 4x more than noncompetitors last season and our events drove record broadcast and digital viewership. We're now looking to build on that success with the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. We have partnered with all 32 NFL teams, our competitions are aligned with key big NFL season and we're welcoming major sponsors, including Pizza Hut, SNICKERS and Starbucks. Finally, the latest season of our fan favorite Madden NFL Mobile game launches tomorrow. And this year, the game is bringing back some of the classic modes that fans love as well as new innovation in social call play and customization. Through great experiences on console and PC, the ever-popular Madden NFL Mobile game and our leading esports programming, Madden NFL continues to reach and engage a wide audience of fans. Our FIFA franchise had a strong -- had a very strong Q1 with players deeply engaged in our Ultimate Team live service. Our biggest in-game event, Team of the Season, had more than 3 million players logging into FUT daily to play, the highest daily levels we've ever seen for this event. Esports of FIFA is exploding as well with our competitive modes growing faster than any other mode in FUT. Momentum is strong across our entire FIFA esports ecosystem and next week's FIFA eWorld Cup finals will be the culmination of a season that has engaged 17 official lead partners, players from 20 different nations, more than 30 live events and more than 60 million total views to date.  Looking ahead to September, FIFA 20 is set to expand our FIFA platform with a brand-new dimension of the game for players who want more personalization, customization and community. VOLTA FOOTBALL brings a street style of experience to the franchise where players can build their own characters, express themselves and play different forms of the sport in different environments around the world. That's in addition to major advancements in the core experience designed to deliver the most authentic football gameplay we've ever produced. FIFA 20 will have an unmatched breadth of top leagues, teams and players included in the game, a continuing differentiator of the authenticity in our FIFA franchise. Our licensing program is built on the strength of multiyear relationships and careful consideration of the most important players, teams and leagues that our fans love to see in the game. From console to PC, to our FIFA Mobile games in the West and China, to our FIFA Online offerings in Asia, FIFA continues to be the way that hundreds of millions of players around the world come together in their shared passion for soccer. Our Sims 4 live service also continues to be a rich and rewarding experience for our players and a strong platform for growth. The Sims 4 continues to be one of the great owned IP success stories of our portfolio and we are planning for FY '20 to be our biggest year yet of new content. Knowing that, we gave more fans a chance to get into the game through a one week promotion in May to download the base game for free. Almost 7 million players downloaded the game during that time. In addition to the base game promotion, total expansion and game pack downloads also increased 55% year-over-year in Q1. We launched our seventh expansion pack, Island Living, in late June and has already become one of the best selling packs for The Sims 4. We are fortunate to have an incredibly vibrant and creative Sims community on console, PC and mobile, and we are continuing to double down on this amazing franchise to reach new players and open up exciting new dimensions of The Sims this year. Subscription services are expanding across the industry as well. We're a pioneer and a leader in this space, having just launched our subscription on a third major platform with EA Access on the Sony PlayStation 4. We believe subscriptions can be transformative to the player experience and the gaming industry over the long term as they offer tremendous value and choice to players and greater flexibility in the games we bring to market. Our PC subscription already includes more than 220 games, 140 of which are from third-party developers. We are continually adding to this with new games from EA, from indie developers seeking to expand their reach through our EA Originals program and from our third-party partners ready to reach more players through our services. We're also working to expand our subscriptions to even more platforms. Mobile continues to be a growth opportunity for us. Live services are a key aspect of our mobile business with franchises like Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile and The Sims continuing to drive strong ongoing engagement. Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes has grown to nearly 80 million players launch-to-date. Galaxy of Heroes has the most deeply engaged community of all of our mobile games and we plan to continue delivering great new content and in-game events to grow the audience this year. We've also just started pre-alpha testing for Plants vs. Zombies 3. In a market where discovering an acquisition can be challenging, Plants vs. Zombies is one of the most beloved brand in gaming. To date, we've had more than 1 billion downloads worldwide of PvZ games in mobile and we're looking forward to bringing something new to fans around the world. We're continuing to prototype and develop more bespoke mobile projects as well as new concept for cross-platform play. The mobile space is complex and competitive and our focus is on bringing more innovation and unique new experiences to mobile players. In addition to the franchises and live services that I've already mentioned, we'll be delivering many other new experiences to players throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. NHL 20 is launching in Q2 with hundreds of gameplay advancements as well as new competitive and multiplayer modes. We'll take the wraps off our new Need for Speed game heading into Gamescom in a few weeks. We have a Plants vs. Zombies shooter title coming to console and PC later this year. And the excitement and anticipation for Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order has been strong coming out of EA PLAY in E3 where the game received 45 award nominations and great vibes from the player community. Respawn's track record speaks for the high-quality games they develop and they have created a brand-new Star Wars story that will be a lot of fun to play when it launches this holiday. From the core game to live services that extend and enhance experience, to new ways to engage through subscriptions and competitive gaming, our focus continues to be on strong execution and delivering innovation, quality and fun for players at every turn. We're fortunate to have some of the greatest and most creative talent in the industry driving our effort to continually learn and improve. With robust, best-in-class technology powering our efforts, we're also in a position to scale and evolve with the changing needs of our players. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We delivered operating results significantly above our expectations this quarter. And at high level, those results were driven by broad strength across our core franchises. Apex Legends continues to delight players and we are pleased with the impact of Season 2 since its launch on July 2. This quarter's result demonstrates how the power of our portfolio strategy, combined with extra content, deliver strong results even in relatively quiet quarters. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.21 billion compared to $1.14 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $79 million. Operating expenses were $607 million compared to $622 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower sales and marketing, partially offset by continued investment in new IP. This was significantly below our forecast, driven by timing of advertising spend. Operating income was $415 million compared to $300 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $4.75, up over 400% year-on-year. Underlying EPS was well above our expectations, driven by net bookings, gross profit and operating expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $158 million, up $38 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $113 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $305 million, leaving $979 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.19 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $743 million, approximately flat year-on-year. It was $53 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. Digital net bookings were $701 million, up $8 million on a year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 76% of our business compared to 69% a year ago. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 12% year-on-year to $504 million, led by Apex Legends and The Sims 4. FIFA Ultimate Team was up 11% year-on-year at a constant currency or 5% at actual exchange rates. Diving into the detail, Season 2 launched for Apex Legends at the beginning of Q2 and we're pleased with its performance with regard to both sales and engagement. We will continue to add content during the quarter with a major event in mid-August, and Season 3 will begin next quarter. We are also increasing investments in content development and marketing to continue to drive growth in Apex Legends. FIFA Online outperformed our expectation. FIFA Online 4 performed well in Korea and Southeast Asia where we have fully transitioned from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4. Meanwhile, FIFA Online 3 outperformed our expectations in China, and we are positioned well for switching over to FIFA Online 4. Finally, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 base game promotion delivered nearly 7 million new installs, and we remain on track to have the fifth consecutive year of growth in The Sims 4 following its launch in 2014. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 17% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. Although down year-on-year, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectation and maintains a highly engaged user base, leading us to be optimistic about performance and a huge year for the Star Wars franchise with new TV shows, movie and theme park launches. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $75 million, down 22% year-on-year due to last year's launch of A Way Out and FIFA 18 World Cup promotions in the quarter. 47% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Although this is up 7 percentage points year-on-year, we continue to model an annual shift of 5 percentage points, given how strongly digital Anthem -- strongly the digital side of Anthem was during the launch last quarter. Before discussing guidance, I'd like to highlight that there were three income tax events in the quarter that impacted our GAAP Q1 results and our full year GAAP guidance. Please refer to our press release for those -- for details on those tax events. As a result, we expect to recognize a $1.7 billion benefit in the fiscal year, which is $200 million better than we included in our guidance last quarter, although the phasing of the benefits between Q1 and Q2 has changed since we gave that guidance. $1.08 billion of this amount was recognized in the first quarter and the remaining $620 million will be recognized when the Swiss tax rates change, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. We do not expect the above events to impact our FY '20 operating cash flow or our management tax rate for fiscal 2020. Now turning to guidance. Except for the increase of our tax benefit of $200 million or $0.66 a share on GAAP EPS, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect The Sims 4 and Apex Legends to each deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.575 billion, with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and free cash flow of around $1.45 billion. For the second quarter, we continue to expect net revenue of $1.315 billion, cost of revenue to be $407 million and operating expenses of $679 million. This results in earnings per share of $2.60 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.23 billion. We're very excited about the Madden NFL launch and the upcoming Apex Legends event and the launch of FIFA 20 with VOLTA FOOTBALL at the end of the quarter. We over-delivered this quarter as a result of the performance of our core franchises. These evergreen live services provide a tremendously solid base for our business and enable us to invest in new opportunities to innovate and to take risks. We are unique among our peers in this and it is no consequence that we are a leader in cloud gaming, subscriptions and in the strength of our player networks. People will only engage with our games if they have fun playing them, and we continue to invest in keeping them fun, whether it's in major innovations such as VOLTA FOOTBALL in FIFA or new modes, events and legends in Apex Legends or even adding laundry to The Sims 4. We aim to give players content they want to play. If we're successful in that, we're successful as a business. The combination of core plus innovation plus fun will drive our success through the year. Coming up in August, we have more live services for our newest franchise, Apex Legends, and the latest installment in one of our most storied Madden NFL. FIFA 20 launches right at the end of the quarter. The following quarter, we have a new IP, Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order. Simultaneously, we continue to invest in more new IP and new technologies and new business models. We believe we have the right ingredients in place to deliver fun for our players and success for our business. And I look forward to reporting on our progress to you next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. The world loves to play games. As the global gaming audience continues to grow and spend more time with the games they love, interactive entertainment is an increasingly important part of our daily life. At the heart of this is social connection, the unique ability that games have to connect and inspire players to be part of a shared experience. New platforms, new technologies and new ways to engage will continue to fuel growth for the industry. And through these opportunities, we are positioning EA to lead. It begins with great games that can fulfill the motivations of a diverse global player base. We continue to invest across our portfolio to deliver the depth, breadth and quality of experiences that players seek. Our top titles across sports, simulation, shooters and racing connect hundreds of millions of players on console, PC and mobile. We create experiences in some of the most popular owned IP in the industry, including The Sims, Battlefield, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. We've introduced powerful new IP like Apex Legends and we are building new licensed experiences like Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order. Our pipeline is full of innovative new projects for our current franchises, new IP and plans to revisit some of our fan favorite brands as we continually work to bring more high-quality games to our players across a growing number of platforms and devices. Live services enable us to build powerful communities where players come together and continue to share in the experiences they love. We've had great success building deeply engaged long-term communities in Ultimate Team, The Sims, Battlefield, Star Wars and more. And now, we're adding that with our massive player base in Apex Legends. Each live service is different, designed uniquely for the community it serves. They also enable us to continually learn from our players, their feedback and their motivations so we can drive more innovation and creative exploration in the future. Interactive entertainment today transcends the act of playing a game. New ways to engage like esports are becoming just as important. With FIFA and Madden, we have the largest esports ecosystem in sports games, and Apex Legends is going to be a major new addition to the global competitive gaming scene this year. We believe that our games can make competition accessible to everyone with the opportunities to bring competitive play to more of our franchises. And we look forward to delivering for more players, viewers, sponsors and broadcasters around the world. With games becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, subscriptions offer compelling new value proposition for players. Other industries have demonstrated how subscriptions fundamentally shift consumer behavior. We consume more television content in different ways because of video subscriptions. We consume more music in different ways because of music subscription services. We believe the same is happening with games where subscriptions can offer access to great content at great value with tremendously low friction. When combined with cloud streaming, the barriers are lowered even further, making it even more compelling to jump into new games and connect with new communities. The subscription opportunity is powerful for both players and game creators, and we're continuing to invest in our leading services on console and PC. In addition to more great games, passionate global communities and new ways to engage, there will be more transformative shifts on the horizon. The content push of progress and innovation is what sets this industry apart from every other form of entertainment. With our teams of incredibly talented developers, artists and engineers, we are working to drive creativity, quality and fun through every aspect of the player experience now and in the future. We look forward to sharing more updates in the months to come. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So Andrew, Blake, it seems like FIFA Online is on a recovery path right now, but this game is still distributed only in Korea, China and Southeast Asia. And I think we have talked about this many times before, the opportunity should be global. So can you tell us where you stand between either FIFA Mobile or other things you may be doing in the background? Because it seems like the demand for this game should be multiples of the audience that you are reaching right now. Andrew Wilson : So again, I think we think about FIFA as a platform that brings together soccer fans or football fans depending on which country you're from together to share in their passion for the game. In any given market, that might mean going to them in different ways with different games on different platforms or different business models. Right now, we entertain probably a couple hundred million people. We see an opportunity for growth there certainly, but when you think about the offering that we have across console, PC and mobile through premium, through live services like Ultimate Team, through access to the game in subscription and free-to-play on mobile and PC in Asia, we feel like that we -- we feel like we have really strong offerings for a global player base. You should imagine that we're always thinking about how we can attract more users to the platform. That's why we are working on VOLTA for this year. We think that that's going to bring in a whole new range of players who love the game but want a different type of play than the traditional 11-on-11. And as we think about more focus going to mobile over time, we also expect that we'll continue to grow that business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : I'd like to better understand how you're tracking against your $300 million to $400 million bookings guidance for Apex Legends and The Sims. How much did you realize in the quarter? Are you about 25% of the way there? And how should we think about the phasing throughout the rest of the year? Blake Jorgensen : Well, I think as we said last quarter, you should expect that the first quarter was smaller [Technical Difficulty] remaining three quarters, Q2 through Q4, because we were still, one, experimenting; and two, we didn't have as much content. Clearly, quarter two has more content in it. We talked today about a major event that's coming in a few weeks in August that will clearly continue to drive the engagement and content, which tends to drive monetization. And you should assume -- Andrew mentioned that Q3 will have even more than Q2, so we're going to continue to build that. I would assume that the back three quarters of the year are probably all about the same size based on what we know today and larger than the first quarter. That's all I can really tell you because it's just early days and we're only one month into -- or less than 1 month into Season 2 right now. But everything's tracking to plan or better for us, and so we're very confident on the $300 million to $400 million on Apex. Obviously, Sims, we've called out that it's in the same range of $300 million to $400 million. We didn't do that before, but we wanted to remind people that our business is not based on Apex Legends alone. It's very important to us, but it's still a relatively small part of our overall business. And franchises like The Sims have been continually producing that range of revenues because we run them as a live service. And we want to make sure people understand, we have confidence in building a live service around Apex and that will continue to grow over time and we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But we know we've got amazing engagement. We have 8 million to 10 million people on a weekly basis playing the game. That's huge for us on almost any game that we see. And we'll continue to take advantage of that, keep them engaged and playing everyday. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : For me as well. First, on Apex, I was wondering more specifically what you see in reengagement with some of the early players in terms of what has drawn them back into the game? And then secondly, Sony made some comments today on third-party software sales, reducing their outlook a little bit. Was just hoping for any color from your end in terms of the preorder environment for some of the titles or the retail environment overall. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I'll hit the second piece. Andrew wants to talk about the Apex engagement, if you want. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I would just come back to the comments that Blake just shared. And we have between 8 million to 10 million people engaging in this game on a week-by-week basis. That is large by any measure. It makes it one of the -- probably the most engaging games. We have continued to see great fan sentiment inside that game. And we expect to continue to grow that audience over time. Again, when we think about Apex Legends, we set out to build something with longevity. And at the very core is a great gameplay experience. And we know that long-term engagement involves the ongoing release of new content and the ongoing running of events, both of which the team at Respawn are doing with great success, but the very core of that is a great gameplay experience. And we're building this in a way that we expect to continue to grow and continue to be a meaningful part of our business for a long time to come. And the sign of engagement that we see today lead us to believe that's possible. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. We think about this as almost like an annual title. We will continue to innovate that game and evolve that game over time and hope to believe -- I believe that we have a 10 year run ahead of us or if not more. There's so much potential and ways to change that game over time and add to that game. We think that there's just huge potential in that and that's how we're managing it. In terms of the news around Sony, I have not seen the Sony news so I don't know exactly what they said. We're not seeing any softness in our demand metrics around our titles. And thus, the reason that we reconfirmed our guidance for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from SunTrust. Matthew Thornton : Blake, maybe one for you and then one for Andrew, if I could quickly. Blake, just in terms of the other guidepost for the year, you talked about Apex, you talked about Sims. I think last quarter you gave us a couple more guidepost around mobile down 10% to 15%, some of the frontline unit assumptions as well. Just curious if there's any changes in those kind of assumptions versus three months ago. And then, Andrew, maybe if you could just talk just really quickly about the VOLTA mode within FIFA and how you're thinking about that impacting engagement? But also monetization, how we should kind of think through that? Any color there would be helpful. Blake Jorgensen : So no changes on guidance. We're pretty consistent with all of the numbers that we provided at the start of the year. And all the metrics that we've seen are leading towards that and we're feeling confident about it. Andrew Wilson : And on VOLTA, again, I go back to some earlier comments, is we do see FIFA like a platform and we do see our opportunity to bring together hundreds of millions of football fans around the world to experience football in a way that is meaningful to them. We do that across platforms. We do that through business models. We do that through different access models and different play models. And what we recognized with the platform at this juncture was that there was a lot of really hard-core football in there. And we expect that, that will continue to be the most meaningful part for much of the FIFA playing community. But there was also a whole group of football fans that wanted a more casual style of play. And we built that model to attract new fans. And what we have seen over time, as we have put new modes in the game, and I will use The Journey, our story-based mode that we did a few years ago now, when we started that mode, is that it brings in a whole new set of players that come in to fulfill different motivations in the game. And ultimately, they become part of the community and the richness of that community and typically move into the more competitive modes in the game like FIFA Ultimate Team and the competitive esports modes inside of Ultimate Team. And so we think about VOLTA that way. So our expectation is not that there will be an impact on monetization over the long term, but rather we are growing the aggregate size of the FIFA community. And that typically, what happens as we grow that community is those players become part of it, become enriched by it and then move more deeper into other modes in the game like Ultimate Team and our competitive esports modes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark. Michael Hickey : I guess on Apex, I've got a ton of questions. I'll try to limit it to a couple. But I was hopeful -- I mean, given the sort of profile of the game, the competitive aspects of it, esports is sort of a no-brainer. It's great to see you guys start to move forward to your first, I guess, state of mind in September, but maybe some more color in terms of how big esports could be in terms of driving engagement, monetization and maybe overall player feel for Apex. And then, I guess, just another add-on, mobile in China, is this still a possibility in '20? Or is this more of a fiscal '21 event now in terms of expanding insulated opportunities [indiscernible]? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Let me hit the mobile one real quick and I'll let talk Andrew talk about esports. We did not put anything in our annual guidance for either mobile globally for Apex in China and that's because we are still obviously working with a partner but we don't have timing set up, but I would assume it's a '21 event in both cases. We'll give you more knowledge or more input as the quarters go on this year as to how that timing will evolve, but right now, I would assume nothing in '20. Andrew Wilson : On esports, again, what we see around the esports community more broadly is the most successful titles are those that have very, very large global player bases where social interaction and competition are at the very core of the experience. And again, I go back to Apex Legends is built as a really, really unbelievable phenomenal game in the first-person shooter category, which has, as its core motivation, both competition and social interaction. And of course, it has a million-strong global audience. So we feel very good about its appeal and its application to an esport. We've also had a series of events and our -- and we'll have our first competition featuring 80 teams later in the year. And as we think about engagement, again, as we've talked about with FIFA and Madden, engagement of competitive gaming players is typically 4x to 7x higher than noncompetitive players. So our expectation is that not only will the esports component help fuel the existing community and drive higher engagement there, but it will ultimately attract new players and new viewers and new spectators and drive higher engagement there as well. So we feel like it's going to be a very important part of the global community over the long term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital. Gerrick Johnson : I guess the obvious question no one's asked yet, bookings should be by $50 million, EPS by $0.30, gross margin by 240 basis points, so why no increase in full year guidance? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I mean it's a good question. I think we've only raised guidance coming out of the first quarter probably once in my tenure here. And it's rare because it's such a small part of the overall year. I would -- if you look at the phasing that we do in our guidance, we basically just dumped it into the fourth quarter, not for any real reason other than that's supportive. It's no -- it's almost all catalog and we just don't know, but it's still small enough that we wanted to at least remain conservative in how we forecast. And based on what transpires in Q2, we'll then decide if we should change guidance or not, but that -- it wasn't much more complicated than that. Gerrick Johnson : Okay. Can I just dig into the gross margin for a second? That outperformed by 240 basis points, so what drove that? Blake Jorgensen : So we have done a faster and better job than we expected on controlling the online cost of revenue, particularly with Apex, but continue across all of our platforms. When we first started Apex, remember that you have millions of people playing, so they can be expensive games to operate, and we called that out in our Q4 earnings conference call. The team led by our CTO, Ken Moss, has worked hard to try to continue to bring down those costs through either different partners or simply how we're operating the game, and I think we've done better than we thought. And we had a bigger digital quarter than we actually expected. We tend to play in around 5% growth of full game downloads, for example, and it was higher this year -- or this quarter. And our digital business was stronger than we had expected, so that really drove it across the board. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research. Raymond Stochel : Not just about Apex, but across all of your content that you're building, how are you thinking about the cadence of updates? Do you think players these days have expectations for a faster content drop cadence than prior? And do you think those expectations are too high now? And what changes do you need to make to hit or come close to those elevated expectations? Andrew Wilson : I think it's a really good question, certainly one that we see and hear a lot. The reality is we build games for a lot of different communities, and every single community is different. Some communities, of course, like a FIFA community, have a natural cadence of events that occur in the real world that we tie things to, and that makes sense for that community. A community like The Sims has a longer cadence flow. Again, we're set to have the biggest year in terms of content release this year, and we've continued to grow that franchise since launch, but it is not typically a weekly cadence of content because it doesn't make sense for that community. If we think of a game like Apex, again, it is, at its core, a great game, and so a lot of the ongoing engagement exist because it's built as a great competitive game. And so when we think about that, we think about seasons not as a onetime event, but seasons as kind of a kick-off -- as a series of events that happen kind of over weeks and months of time. We feel really good about where we're at with Season 2 on Apex. We think that we're learning as we go. Again, this is -- remember, FIFA Ultimate Team, we started this what is now over 10 years ago. It started very small. We've got much better at engaging with the community over that period of time. And now, Ultimate Team is this tremendous business for us. The same is true for The Sims, which launched in 2014. We get smarter and better in terms of understanding how to fulfill the motivations and the desires of our players. And we expect that we'll continue to learn and get better with Apex as well. One thing that we do try and avoid is that we end up purely as a content furnace with our games. We try and make games that have great gameplay that engage at their very core, and then we're able to build on engagement and fulfill motivations with additional content and additional events. But we try and avoid wherever possible finding ourselves in a position where content is the only means of driving engagement because we just feel it's harder to build longevity with that type of model over time. And we've learned that through over 10 to 15 years of live service experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cohen from Stephens. Jeffrey Cohen : Thanks for the incremental color on The Sims. It feels like that franchise would be one that would do really well on the Nintendo Switch. So I'm curious how you guys determine which platforms you'd bring the game to or games to? And is there any reason why you wouldn't want to bring that one on there? Andrew Wilson : Any time we're evaluating platform conversations, we are really looking at a couple of things. One, does the game really fit the profile of that platform in terms of the control or the community ecosystem? Two, do we think the community playing on that platform would appreciate the game to go there? Or would they prefer to play it somewhere else? We have a lot of data that would suggest a great many Switch owners also own a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One or a PC and very often choose to play the games that we make on those platforms even though they have a Switch and they enjoy a lot of great content on the Switch. And so there's always an evaluation process that goes on a case-by-case basis. And I wouldn't say that The Sims would never go to the Switch, but I think we're doing really, really well attracting Sims players. As we said, we did the promotion in the last couple of months and brought in 7 million new Sims players that we expect will engage in that community on a platform that is really tailored to user-generated content, creativity and customization. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Todd Juenger : Can I visit just a little bit at Respawn, just the resource question? It's something we get from investors a fair amount. And so obviously that studio is being taxed with some really important stuff. So I guess would love to hear your thoughts on how resourced the Apex Legends effort is, either in terms of bodies or dollars or whatever you can say? And where did that come from? And did any of that get pulled from the Star Wars effort? And just to reassure us that you've got enough on all of that. And why don't I leave at that? It's a pretty broad question. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Good question. I would offer a few pieces of feedback that I think will make you feel better about life. The first is that there are multiple teams at Respawn, very different teams as well. Again, Apex Legends is a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter and has a bespoke team specific to that type of game. This is the team that had worked on Call of Duty many years ago, had launched Titanfall, and now Apex Legends. So this is very much their particular skill set. The Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order team is a completely different type of team led by Stig, who had been a game director on God of War, and it's all about the single player journey fantasy of being a Jedi. And so they have two discrete teams. And there's actually a third team at Respawn as well working on some new things. In addition to that, this is where scale matters in this industry. In Electronic Arts, we have a very large central group that can provide art, engineering and design help if needed across the company, and we have a number of live services teams also across the company that are well-suited for the creation of new content. And so the combination of individual teams inside Respawn that are individually staffed with their specific games in mind and the global scale of EA and the central resources that we have to help across art and engineering, we feel very, very good about our ability to sustain the needs of our global player base. Blake Jorgensen : We've also pulled teams from outside of Respawn to provide them resources on development if they wish to do so -- as Respawn wishes to do so. We have a large DICE team in LA, for example. We have a large live services team in Vancouver. And what we've tried to do is perfect our organization to be able to work long distance as well as in the middle of a studio. And so we've given them the opportunity to pull on any resources they want. And they're very, very conscious about how to make sure they've built the best game and they use the resources very effectively to do that, but they -- there's no shortage of resources relative to what they need. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe another big picture question. As you think medium to long term on the shift you're trying to execute on towards more subscription services and cloud-based distribution models, how do you also think about allocating resources against that longer-term goal versus maybe the shorter to medium-term transition where the industry could go through another console cycle next year and how you think about aligning resources and assets inside the company against both those transitions? Andrew Wilson : Another good question. And so I would start with it doesn't matter what the platform or the distribution model or the business model. What matters is that we build great games. And we are doubling down and working with great diligence across our studio organization to ensure our teams have everything they need to build great games. And that will continue to be our focus near-term, medium-term and long-term. In addition to that, again, given the scale of this company and the leadership of our CTO, Ken Moss, and what we've talked about with Project Atlas some months ago, is we're also investing for the future to ensure we don't find ourselves out of position. As a company, we started to invest in our digital platform over five years ago. I think we're still the only developer publisher with a unique ID system that carries with our players regardless of game or platform they play on. We have a single data scheme and data platform across the company and single infrastructure in security and transaction engine and these types of things. So we've been working on this model for some number of years to ensure that we are ready for the future. Now, as we think about cloud and subscription, again, we went out -- we bought a small company out of Israel that really gave us a head start in how we think about cloud fabric. We've been working on learning an organizational structure around subscription. And so we feel really good about our future there. But at the end of the day, we continue to be focused on making great games. We have seen the value of great games in games like FIFA and Madden and The Sims and Apex Legends, and we expect that we will continue deliver great games and -- but ensure that we have the technology backbone there to when the industry is ready. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I think we've obviously been doing tests and learning along the way. So we started with our subscription on EA Access on Microsoft. We've learned a lot from that. Obviously, rolled out on Origin. And then, as Andrew mentioned earlier, we just rolled out on Sony. And each of those rollouts have gotten easier and easier because we understand the technology better, but more importantly, what the consumer wants. And so it becomes more of the muscle memory of the company versus having to start a new initiative from scratch. We're working hard on moving -- building games for next year on Gen 5. I think it's obvious. I think everybody in the industry is doing that. As has happened in the past, not all games come out on Gen 5 immediately. And obviously, with games like Madden, you'd probably bring the Gen 5 game out when the Gen 5 console ships, not when Madden itself ships, but we'll be ready on Gen 5. We're very excited about it and we've been working on it for some time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies. Alexander Giaimo : I was just curious if we can get your updated thoughts on the overall mobile strategy. It looks like mobile bookings were down another 17% year-over-year. I know a lot of that is due to the aging of some legacy titles. So maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing there. And then with all of the smaller mobile developers out there, is this a sector where M&A might make sense? Andrew Wilson : Yes. A good question and either -- we've not had a material shift from our stated strategy over the last couple of quarters. I think we continue to see the mobile industry grow. It's a very meaningful part of the revenue profile, of the contribution, but it's also extraordinarily competitive and it's very tough and we've seen a lot of large-scale mobile games and mobile companies in pretty serious decline over the last 6 to 12 months. We have a mobile business that still has an operating contribution of 40%. So it's very, very profitable as a mobile business. And we've held on to that and we feel very good about that. But if we think about our strategy, I would talk about it in three core categories. One is that we have some tremendous games in live service mode, and what we're seeing is the average age of the top titles on mobile is actually getting older as those games scale and it's harder and harder to break in. So when you look at games that we have like Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes or Madden Mobile or FIFA globally, we feel very good about our ability to grow those live services over time and really work hard to ensure that we're filling -- fulfilling the community. The second element of that is, is that we are in a world where acquisition of new players is really, really tough and it's really hard to break into the mobile charts. We're really focusing on our IP that we believe has real resonance inside the community, and again, like Plants vs. Zombies, which has been downloaded over 1 billion times, is absolutely a candidate there. And you should expect that we will focus on our IP that we think can break out in what is otherwise a very costly acquisition market. And then third, I think you are right. There are a number of smaller mobile companies out there who have the capacity to build some great games but maybe don't have the marketing firepower to actually break into the market or the network of players that we have that they could access. And I think there will be an opportunity for some M&A over time. I don't think that's an easy path, but we're certainly out there and talking to a number of different players about how we might accelerate their otherwise senior objectives. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. If you had to think about it on priorities, I mean clearly, as we mentioned, we'll have a new Plants vs. Zombies game, a high priority for us; Apex going mobile, and that's globally a high priority for us. And FIFA and Madden remain super high priorities because they're two of our largest games. And as we talked about earlier, the global opportunity for FIFA, including China, is very large. And so we're spending a lot of time there and we'll continue to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin from Deutsche Bank. Clayton Griffin : Blake, I just want to follow-up on what you talked about in terms of learnings coming out of -- on Microsoft EA Access and just if we can get an update on what you're seeing in terms of user behavior. I know it's early days with Sony, but what you're seeing there, relative willingness to engage with live services on those platforms. Any color there would be helpful. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I mean what we first saw and has pretty much stayed true across almost all of the platforms is that people ended up playing twice as many games as they did before they joined the service, which is kind of a no-brainer because that's what you would typically see, say, on a Netflix or a Spotify or others because you've reduced some of the friction of trial essentially. But we also find that people played their games a lot longer, meaning they found a game that they really enjoy playing that they didn't know about. And so it's the discovery aspects of where a service goes which helps a lot. And then if it has a live service on it like in Ultimate Team, they start to spend more money than they did before they went into the service. And part of that might be subscription behavior where oftentimes people think they're getting things for free and are willing to spend on them, and sometimes they just -- they found something they didn't know that they wanted to play and they get deeply engaged in it. And so we're trying to reduce the friction of trial to see new games and to learn about things that they didn't know or didn't want to spend money on getting in by giving them an amazing economic value to start a subscription, and that's stayed true across all of the platforms. And the one other piece is that you were going to wrestle within any subscription is how do you manage the churn over time and you've got to curate dropping content into the subscriptions at a fairly predictable rate so people will stay in. And we've been trying to do that by bringing third-party content in to help fill in the places where we don't have content because we don't necessarily have content every quarter. And we're thinking about how games might even change in terms of how they're developed over time to better match subscriptions. So you have more to come, but we're in a really good position. We have more subscribers than any other service in the industry by a long shot and I think a lot better experience base because of that. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one is you talked a little bit about resource allocation, kind of going back to a couple of the earlier questions, the one from Eric. Can you talk to us a little bit about what percentage of the overall R&D budget or headcount is sort of being attributed toward new potential franchises and new IP just so that investors would kind of get an idea for what could be in the pipeline as we head into 2021 and beyond? And then the second one, on NBA Live, just philosophical thoughts about potentially going free-to-play on that. Blake Jorgensen : Why don't I start with the first one? I'll let Andrew take the NBA question. We would say, as a rough allocation, it's probably 20% of our R&D budget. That's always hard because do you call VOLTA new IP? We certainly do internally, but it was part of this -- the FIFA team that have developed and evolved that product versus a brand-new IP from scratch that we may be working on, like an Anthem, for example. We try to do both where we're evolving games with new IP and new gameplay modes, but we also try to make sure when we're thinking about games for 2000 -- our fiscal '25 and '26 and '27, way out, where there may be a small group of people starting to ideate and generate the concepts, but you don't scale it up for a couple of years until you really get it to a status or a place where you think you are ready to build the game. But we've always kind of mixed it that way. And it's a balance between inside game teams, as I mentioned, as well as stand-alone teams that we're developing that didn't exist before. But we're comfortable with that mix. Andrew Wilson : Yes. On NBA, we've seen some speculation but -- around free-to-play, but we don't have anything to share at this time. Our game team has been working hard. As a company and as an EA SPORTS brand, we remain committed to basketball and our partners, the NBA and the NBA Players Association. And our game keeps getting better and better every year, and we'll be excited to bring NBA Live 20 to market soon. Blake Jorgensen : All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We'll talk to everyone either during the quarter as we see you around the country. Appreciate all your interest. And we'll also talk to you next quarter at the earnings call. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. We continued a strong FY '20 with an excellent second quarter. Our latest EA SPORTS titles are captivating a growing global player base, and deep engagement in these titles and our ongoing live services fueled our continued momentum through Q2. As a result, our revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations for Q2, and we are raising our full year guidance today. At Electronic Arts, we are focused on creating amazing new games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and reaching more players when and where they want to play. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here of how we delivered against these focus areas during Q2. First, let\u2019s cover our new games. EA SPORTS is innovating for a growing audience of fans. Madden NFL 20 is off to an outstanding start, growing year-over-year in player engagement, units sold and Ultimate Team. The excellent core gameplay and fresh new experiences in franchise mode are delivering for our loyal fans, while Superstar X-Factors and the all-new Superstar KO mode are resonating with a broader football community. With a launch that began earlier in the preseason and a second major beat at the NFL Kickoff weekend that brought more players into the game, we\u2019ve delivered growth across the board in Madden. Unique players were up 12% year-over-year in Q2, games played in franchise mode more than doubled to over 100 million in the same period, and Madden Ultimate Team unique players are up nearly 20% year over-year. Our Madden competitive gaming season has kicked off as well. Our major tournaments are aligned to key moments in the NFL season, we have a groundbreaking virtual stadium rights partner, and other major brands are partnering with us throughout the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. The innovation in FIFA 20 is also deeply engaging fans and bringing new players into the franchise. Total players in FIFA were up nearly 15% year-over-year in Q2, and with the addition of the VOLTA Football street soccer experience, new-to-franchise players have grown 7% year over-year. Enhancements to the core gameplay and Ultimate Team are also re-engaging more franchise veterans, with unique players in FIFA Ultimate Team growing 22% over last year. People are playing more FIFA than ever before, with total in-game matches up more than 30% year-over-year. And as players continue to engage in the FIFA 20 experience and Ultimate Team, our FIFA 20 Global Series is kicking off in November, with millions set to compete in our unparalleled nine-month worldwide esports competition. Last season, more than 800 million minutes of FIFA esports content were watched, and with sponsors like Adidas and others breaking new ground with us this year, we\u2019re excited to reach an expanding audience with more great content. We also saw growth across our broader EA SPORTS portfolio. With innovations in NHL 20 delivering for hockey fans, Hockey Ultimate Team grew year-over-year in Q2. FIFA Online in Korea had some of our strongest-ever months on PC, and we\u2019re also seeing growth in China. FIFA Mobile has now been downloaded more than 250 million times life to date, following the launch of our latest season that includes 650 new in-game events. It was a very strong Q2 for EA SPORTS, and we\u2019re excited to build on that momentum throughout FY20. Q2 also showed the strength of our ongoing live services. In Apex Legends, we continue to deepen our long-term investment in the game and its community. With each successive season of new content, we are building, adding to the experience, and learning. For the first season in March, we launched the Battle Pass, and began the regular introduction of new legends. In the second season in July, we brought more content, a map update, ranked leagues and larger events. The third season, which launched in October, is our biggest yet with an entirely new map, amazing events like the Halloween-themed content in the game now, and much more to come. Weekly average player peaks in Season Three are significantly above our Season Two peaks, and we\u2019re continuing to bring more new players into the game. Apex Legends is a major long term franchise for us. Since launch, we\u2019ve significantly expanded the team working on the game, and it continues to grow. Our pipeline of future content is packed with really fun experiences that will be delivered through upcoming seasons and a regular cadence of updates for the community. With the Apex Legends community now growing past 70 million players, we\u2019re focused on expanding to mobile, new platforms and new geographies, as well as launching an Apex competitive gaming program that we\u2019ll share details on soon. The Sims 4 also continues to be an incredible long-term live service with a growing audience. Monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year in The Sims 4, and engagement across the franchise has led The Sims to surpass $5 billion in lifetime sales. The Sims continues to be one of the great franchises in gaming, and we have plans to bring new experiences to its amazing players for a long time to come. We are also reaching new milestones as we seek to bring great games and services to more players on more platforms. The launch of EA Access on PlayStation 4 significantly grew our subscriber base through the course of Q2. We also announced this morning our plans to bring EA Access to Steam on PC, adding a fourth platform where players will be able to connect and get the benefits and value of our subscription service. This is a unique and exciting partnership with Valve that will enable us to bring PC players in the Steam and Origin communities together. Helping more players connect to our games whenever and wherever they want to play will be a continuing focus for us. We look forward to sharing more announcements about other platforms in the coming months. For our holiday quarter of FY '20, we\u2019re delivering great new games and content across our portfolio. First, the irreverent new Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville launched two weeks ago to praise from fans and critics, and we\u2019re looking forward to the holidays for this family-friendly game. In early November, Need for Speed Heat arrives for racing fans, blending street racing by day and underground racing by night, all with the deep customization that fans expect. Players have been getting primed through the Need for Speed Heat Studio mobile app launched this summer, where they have already customized more than 7 million cars, which can be loaded straight into the game at launch. Then, on November 15, Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order arrives worldwide. This game is coming to market at such an amazing time. From the launch of Star Wars : Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disney theme parks; to the upcoming Disney+ series The Mandalorian; to ongoing games like Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront II, and The Old Republic; to the culmination of the Skywalker saga in the upcoming film, Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker, this is a year unlike any other for hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans out there. The one fantasy that many of those fans have been telling us they want is to experience the journey of becoming a Jedi and we\u2019re set to deliver that with Jedi : Fallen Order. The Respawn team have been pouring their passion into creating this new game in partnership with Lucasfilm, with characters old and new, and a story that is now an authentic part of the Star Wars universe. It\u2019s going to be a thrilling adventure to play, and with more than 140 million views to date of trailers and videos for the game, the community is eager to jump into Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order in just a few more weeks. The holidays will also be a busy season for players in our live services. Our Battlefield V players will be able to jump into the expansive new Pacific theater, a major addition to the game that includes new factions, maps, weapons and vehicles, starting two days from now. And in Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS franchises, The Sims 4, Anthem and Star Wars Battlefront II, our communities will all have new content and new experiences to dive into during the holiday quarter. Looking farther ahead, I want to share a few thoughts on FY \u201821 and our plans for the continued growth of Electronic Arts. We reach a massive global audience of players with our games today, and we have a core business fueled by live services that continues to grow. Next year, we will build on that with a full slate of new EA SPORTS experiences, including new titles that we are adding to our sports portfolio. New consoles are always an opportunity to drive more innovation in our EA SPORTS games, as our fans are eager to begin experiencing a new generation of play. That will include our plans for NBA LIVE. With great support from the NBA and NBA Players Association, we had been working on an innovative new direction for our game timed with the All-Star weekend, an experience designed around new ways for players to engage, connect and create through basketball. Now, with greater understanding of the new platforms and what they can power, bringing social connection, accessibility, and player creativity to the forefront, we feel we can go so much further with the new design. So we\u2019ve decided not to ship an NBA LIVE game in FY '20. Instead, we\u2019re expanding our vision for NBA LIVE, and continuing to work closely with our NBA and NB Players Association partners on this new project that we\u2019ll share more details on next year. Our live services will continue to grow and enhance the experience in our major franchises. We\u2019re expanding our Apex Legends team to deliver our content plans for FY '21, and we will reach new audiences through mobile and across Asia. We have ongoing growth expectations for The Sims 4, with new expansions and all-new ways to engage and grow the community. Our Battlefield franchise and its community are also a major focus for us, and we\u2019ll add new content and new ways to play Battlefield V in FY '21. Targeting new innovation that will be enabled by next-gen platforms and a growing install base on the new consoles, our next Battlefield game is set for FY '22. We also have plans for new experiences that we\u2019ve not yet announced for next year, new titles and new IP for multiple platforms. Introducing new games will always be at our core, and we look forward to exciting players with unexpected new titles in FY21. We will also be driving new opportunities to connect with more players through expansion our subscription services, new platforms, cloud gaming, and more. We\u2019re confident in the continued growth of our business at Electronic Arts through FY '20, FY '21 and beyond. We have a big holiday quarter ahead of us, and we\u2019re excited to continue a strong year. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. The strong results this quarter illustrate the power of our focus on live services and on our core franchises. Games are evolving, and the way people play them is changing. We had great launches for FIFA and Madden, and the quarter\u2019s story is dominated by live services that engage players over extended periods of time. Live services strength in Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Apex Legends and FIFA Online drove performance significantly above last year. I\u2019ll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter\u2019s results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA\u2019s net revenue was $1.348 billion, above our guidance by $33 million. Operating expenses were $675 million, $4 million lower than our guidance. GAAP operating income was $268 million, compared to an operating income of $258 million a year ago, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.89, $0.29 better than our guidance. As a reminder, $2.11 of our earnings was driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, lower operating expenses and a richer digital mix. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $37 million, up $163 million from last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher profit and faster collections. Operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months was $1.748 billion, $290 million above last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $10 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.3 million shares at a cost of $306 million, leaving $674 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.277 billion, up $55 million on the prior year, and $47 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven by broad strength across our portfolio with notable growth in live services. Digital net bookings were $790 million, up 24% on the year-ago period, and a new record for the second quarter, driven by growth across our numerous live services offerings as well as an increase in full-game digital downloads. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing twelve-month basis, compared to 69% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter\u2019s digital net bookings in turn, Live services net bookings were up 50% year-on-year, to $493 million, another new Q2 record. The increase was driven by Apex Legends, Ultimate Team, in Madden, FIFA and NHL, The Sims 4, and FIFA Online, partially offset by the tail of Battlefield 1 DLC. EA Access is off to a great start on PlayStation. Ultimate Team net bookings grew strongly year-on-year for both Madden and FIFA. Even adjusting for the fact that Madden had an extra week in the quarter, and both Madden and FIFA benefitted from early access sales on PlayStation through EA Access, both were up double-digit percentages over last year. Notably, given that we launched VOLTA Football in FIFA 20 and it immediately became the number 2 mode in the game, behind only Ultimate Team, weekly average users for FIFA Ultimate Team still grew 15% year-on-year. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 20% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. The segment outperformed our expectations, driven by new content in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. FIFA Mobile China, FIFA Online 4 Mobile, Madden Mobile and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes all grew this quarter, and, subsequent to quarter end, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes had its second-biggest day ever. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $175 million, 11% higher than last year, another Q2 record. The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year-on-year, to 51%. FIFA launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first 3 weeks of sales, it was about 34% digital, up from 29% in the comparable period for FIFA 19. Overall, 50% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the 12 months to September 30. This compares to just 42% a year ago. Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.410 billion, and earnings per share of $9.57. As a reminder, $5.74 of this is driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.625 billion, $50 million above our prior expectations. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.50 billion. With regards to business drivers, we have raised our net bookings outlook for the year to $5.125 billion. Live services remain strong, and we continue to expect Apex Legends and The Sims to both deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We\u2019re not passing through the full beat, primarily as the FX headwind has increased significantly and we have pushed NBA Live 20 and Respawn\u2019s VR Medal of Honor title out of the year. Together, these headwinds amount to approximately $100 million against our original expectations for net bookings. For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.51 billion, cost of revenue to be $482 million, and operating expenses of $733 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, driven by the negative adjustment to variable compensation a year ago. This results in earnings per share of $0.92 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 295 million. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.94 billion. This is up 21% year-on-year, driven by live services, particularly Apex Legends and Ultimate Team, and because we have two launches in the quarter this year, versus one last year. We released the launch trailer for Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order this morning, and early reaction appears extremely positive. We\u2019re excited to bring this action title to Star Wars fans on November 15, and continue to model sales in the range of 6 to 8 million units. We are modelling Need For Speed Heat to perform similarly to previous titles in that franchise, with unit sales of 3 to 4 million units. Looking further ahead, I\u2019d like to expand on the view Andrew gave you into our fiscal 2021 slate. We\u2019re doubling down on live services combined with our core franchises. We\u2019re investing in Apex Legends as our shooter in fiscal 2021. We expect to drive growth in all of our major live services next year, including Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, FIFA Online and The Sims. We will continue to grow our subscription business. We believe Apex growth will be driven in part by the continued expansion of content and by the launch of the service on new platforms, geographies and on mobile. As Andrew noted, the Sims is now a $5 billion franchise for us, and it continues to grow, driven by new content and new platforms. Mobile growth will be driven by the ramp of our new Plants vs. Zombies title, sports on mobile, including FIFA Mobile in Asia, and Apex Legends, offset by aging titles elsewhere in our portfolio. With regards to product launches in fiscal 2021, we will add at least one more sports title to our annual slate. We will launch Medal of Honor VR. We\u2019ll deliver some exciting remasters of fan favorites, including the Command & Conquer game we\u2019ve already disclosed. And we have two new unannounced EA Partners titles coming from third-party developers. In addition, we have other unannounced titles in the FY21 slate, we will give specifics nearer the time. Overall, we expect to drive growth in net bookings and underlying profits for fiscal 2021. We will provide formal guidance on our Q4 call as usual. Growth in fiscal 2022 will be led by a new and very exciting Battlefield title. I introduced the quarter by discussing how player preferences have changed the way we build and deliver games. We\u2019re investing in games that people play for longer and engage with much more deeply. For example, the number of matches played in FIFA per player has grown nearly 10% year-on-year, and we expect VOLTA to grow that still further. Similarly, the time spent playing matches in Madden NFL 20 is up by about one third. We expect this strategy and focus will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. It is a great time to be part of the interactive entertainment industry. The excitement throughout the community for new experiences and innovation shows how games more than any other form of entertainment can bring people together. Billions of people, from every corner of the world, bring their passion to play, connect, compete, and share through games. Making that possible is what drives every single one of us at Electronic Arts. Amazing games are the very core of our business growth. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio of games across genres, fulfilling a breadth of motivations for our players. From escape in Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, to competition though EA SPORTS, to social connection in Battlefield V, and more. Creativity fuels our future, and our studios have many more new experiences in development. New IP at Motive, new projects at DICE, Bioware, Maxis and Criterion, new mobile titles, new titles for EA SPORTS, new indie and third-party developer titles, all that will continue to excite and grow our global audience. Live services extend and enhance the experience of those games. Apex Legends, FIFA, The Sims 4, Galaxy of Heroes and more of our top franchises have thriving global communities spanning hundreds of millions of players. We\u2019ve been pioneers in this space, building on years of expertise and success to deliver continuously evolving experiences fueled by new content, in game events, and fan-requested updates. Competitive gaming adds another dimension to the experience to play and watch, and we\u2019re building on our strength here with more of our franchises set to enter esports in the coming months. As players around the world play their favorite games for longer periods of time, robust live services will continue to be vital to the experience, and a growth driver for our business. Reaching more players on more platforms is also a key driver for us. New consoles, cloud gaming, and more platform choices will continue to expand the addressable audience. We\u2019re thrilled to be bringing the EA and Steam communities together through the EA Access subscription, and we\u2019re working to reach more platforms in the near future. As cloud gaming continues to develop, through Project Atlas we are testing games streamed on public cloud infrastructure to ensure we are at the forefront of this developing space. We\u2019re also very excited to continue working with our first-party partners on their new platforms, where we\u2019ll be well positioned to deliver some outstanding new experiences beginning next year. With some of the most talented, creative and passionate teams in the industry, we are building momentum. Our focus on making great games and live services for more players around the world has never been stronger. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. On the live services commentary, just want to make sure we are understanding the key messages on how much of the doubling down on live services has to do with existing franchises, which is how we should think about the key to investment and make against new franchises where you see pockets of the industry where you can extend into live services and broaden out the portfolio looking out over the next couple years? That's number one. And, Andrew, you're coming on EA SPORTS, I'm just curious what you mean by the potential to broaden out the portfolio there as well. We saw a headline today about the MCAA and possible compensation of athlete. That's an area where you guys have historically had some success going back to football title from years ago. How should we think about the opportunity around broadening out EA SPORTS as well? Thanks so much, guys. Blake Jorgensen : So let me take live server one first, Eric. You know, we have invested heavily in live services over the past 10 years. Obviously, we're seeing the benefits of that today with titles like Ultimate Team across all our sports and The Sims, obviously Apex is a new live service which we will invest heavily in to try to continue to grow that business. We view that as an annual shooter franchise effectively. And we're trying to build that as a 10 year business not one year or two year business. And we're very excited about the roadmap that the response team has put in place. Beyond that, obviously FIFA Online in Asia is critical. We're announcing as we move from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Korea rapid growth. We're still operating both platforms online 3, and online 4 in China and over time, we'll move to a single platform there. But we feel like we're out of the woods on the bad comp from last year and so we're starting to see good growth there. And we're looking at how do we extend live services across every single one of our titles that can be as successful or more successful than what we see on our sports titles and The Sims and Apex. That includes titles like Battlefield titles, the action game like Anthem and you\u2019ll continue to see improvements across that and we\u2019re excited about where that can go. It is how people want to play games. It is where we think we have a skillset that is different than many of the other game companies and we think we can continue to be very successful there. Andrew Wilson : On the EA\u2019s SPORTS point, there are a number of EA SPORTS games that we\u2019ve worked on or developed or published over the years. Some of those sports, we\u2019re seeing strong resurgence and strong growth, and we\u2019re investing back in. It\u2019s an area of key strength for us as a business, and EA SPORTS teams have demonstrated an ability to truly engage a global population of sports fans. With respect to NCAA Sports in general, yes, we have been in that business before as well. We saw the news today as did you, we had fed into the NCAA Working Group. That news today was new to us. We\u2019re still digesting it. We would anticipate that there is still a number of things that would have to happen over the coming years before we will be able to get back into that business, but certainly we\u2019re watching closely. Chris Evenden : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson : Hey, good afternoon. So, you guys talked a lot about what\u2019s coming into fiscal \u201821. I thought it might just be helpful to summarize fiscal \u201821 and how you kind of comp incremental titles launching fiscal \u201820. So, just kind of rattling through it, growth for Apex Legends, FIFA Online in Asia will grow Ultimate Team for both Madden and FIFA grow, Sims I\u2019m not sure if you were implying growth or not, a new sports title, Command & Conquer, NBA Live, VR, two new partner titles and maybe a couple of other titles that you can announce right now. Is that sound correct or was there anything I missed regarding? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, no, we were implying growth for Sims as well. We\u2019ve continued to grow that title every year for that since it was shipped what seven years ago and we feel that continues on. They\u2019ve got a really robust plan for continued growth. And there may be some other re-masters that we do along the Command & Conquer line that we just haven\u2019t announced yet. But that \u2013 we believe all that yield is pretty exciting fiscal 2021. And effectively, what we\u2019re doing is giving you some guidance on fiscal 2022, knowing that the Battlefield is coming then. And remember, the goal of Battlefield for 2022 is to really take advantage of a larger installed base of the new console. Bringing out Battlefield next year, where the new console base is fairly small, doesn\u2019t really give justice to the potential of the title. And so that\u2019s part of our driver and moving the title into fiscal 2022. So, think about it as multiyear growth model that we just tried to lay out for people, and we\u2019re pretty excited about it. Michael Olson : Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. It sounds like you\u2019re implying Apex Legends will grow and still kind of some of the whole that not having the Battlefield will create. I know it\u2019s hard to quantify but kind of qualitatively, how much is a growth in Apex next year is dependent on getting the game approved in China and having success with the title on mobile as well? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, it\u2019s hard to predict when you get approval in China, so we don\u2019t know. So, I would assume that an Apex China console PC game is probably the tail end of the year, if not even the following year. We think, we\u2019ve got a faster pace on mobile globally ex-China. So, we would hope to see that in the year as well, sometime during the year, really depends on how long we keep it in soft launch. But we\u2019re obviously including those as we think about growth but the bulk of that growth is probably \u201822 verses \u201821 where we really start to gain traction there. Michael Olson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, this is David on for Alexia. Just within your live services results, is it possible to quantify it all the contribution that you\u2019ve seen from subscription in the quarter? And maybe how should we think about the trajectory of subscriptions going forward, just following the partnership with Valve you announced this morning? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, I mean, subscriptions, I mean, live services so large, subscription is still a relatively small portion of that. We are around 5 million subscribers now and have grown much faster on the Sony platform than we did in the early days of the Microsoft platform. Obviously, there are more consoles out there now, so that helps it. But the Sony platform has grown well beyond our expectations, and we\u2019re very excited and they\u2019ve been a great partner for us. As Andrew mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to drive subscriptions across as many platforms as we can. We want to go where the gamers play. And clearly that was the driver of Valve Steam approach. What we found is that subscribers engage more and spend more money at the end of the day. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great business model. They\u2019re very sticky. They tend to stay in the subscriptions longer and they\u2019re looking for great content and they find games they\u2019ve never played before then start to monetize in those games. And that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re so optimistic about it. But it\u2019s still a relatively smaller portion of the overall business because, obviously, in the quarter, almost $500 million of revenue, the big dominators there are Apex and Ultimate Team and followed by The Sims and FIFA Online in Asia, but it continues to be an important part of the overall life services business. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric Handler : Thank you very much and appreciate all of the details you guys have given on the call so far. A couple quick things, hoping you can help out with. One thing that was not mentioned was Titanfall 3 and has that been sort of integrated now into Apex Legends? Is that still being looked at as a separate title? Blake Jorgensen : It certainly could be a separate title in the future where we really want to keep the team hyper focused on Apex because we see there\u2019s so much opportunity there. But \u2013 so I can\u2019t give you a sense of if and when it will come, but it\u2019s still a great brand and we certainly won\u2019t forget about it down the road. Eric Handler : Okay. And then two other quick falls. When you talk about doubling down on live services for next year, you\u2019ve obviously been focusing on live services for a while, but is anything changing with regards to the amount of spending that you guys are doing or anything financially with the model as you double down on these live services? Andrew Wilson : Yeah, I think there\u2019s really three, four changes. One is, we\u2019re seeing players want to apply and engage more. Again, over the last 24 to 36 months or even a little longer than that, you\u2019ve seen us focused deeply on live service and drive engagement into our games. And you saw that through last year, and we\u2019re seeing that pay off this year. And so, as we look forward, we\u2019re seeing players\u2019 events even greater intention to spend more time into those games. So, this really \u2013 there is two other broad changes. One is just how we developed the cold features inside that game and we\u2019re doubling down on those types of features that allow players to fulfil those cool motivations that drive alive service, social interaction, competition, self-improvement, creation, those things that really drive our live service business. And then we\u2019re doubling down on the teams both in terms of development and marketing in terms of how we bring those things to market. And what you\u2019ve seen this year is a willingness for us to do things slightly differently. If you take what we did with Madden this year, we launched the game earlier and we held another whole set of content for a different audience and marketed that differently, entitled that differently and released at around kickoff, and we\u2019re seeing tremendous success as a result of that. And so not only will we build a double down on the actual development of the feature set, we\u2019re also going to be speaking and communicating and marketing the content differently to gamers across the board. Blake Jorgensen : And part of it is changing the talent mix. We\u2019re bringing in more people that have live service expertise. I think there\u2019s probably no one in the world that has better live service expertise than we do in sports. But you need to make sure you\u2019re bringing in talent that can support a team like Apex, support the Battlefield teams so forth. And that\u2019s important because the talent mix is very different and we\u2019ve been successful in recruiting some fabulous people into those teams and will continue to focus on that. Eric Handler : Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Hey, thank you. So Andrew, I\u2019m just wanted to dig in a little bit more in terms of the decision making process that went into Battlefield skipping a year here. So \u2013 and I was wondering whether this is a conscientious decision to shift the direction of the franchise or is this more of a resource constraint decision? And should we still be thinking about those franchise or something that is still a two year or maybe even a three year cycle release or maybe more like a perpetual service like what you may have been intending to do with Anthem. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Good question. So, still that resource constraints, I\u2019ll say that up front, but it was a very thought through decision for us and there was a few factors that came into play. And the first is that we still see a burgeoning opportunity with Battlefield V. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re about to launch a whole new theater of wall with the Pacific theater and the team is still really thinking about, how they can continue to drive that service on a going forward basis. So, we think there\u2019s opportunity still inside the Battlefield V experience, as it was built as a bite large service from the beginning. The second is we now effectively have an annualized shooter Apex Legends and we see tremendous growth opportunity that can continue to engage, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, now over 70 million players. And as Blake talked about, we have opportunity to take that into other regions and to other platforms. And we think is a tremendous growth opportunity on that and want to make sure that we give that the time that it deserves. And then third, as we thought about building for the next Battlefield. Battlefield has always been cutting edge, leading edge, both in terms of visual fidelity, and in gameplay and in multiplayer play. And as a team really began working against that. It became a parent to us that, launching into the next gen platforms was going to offer tremendous opportunity for innovation. But we really wanted to give the install base some opportunity to grow. And believe that in combination with the first three things I talked about launching battlefield in FY \u201822 is a really strong move for us and presents us with an opportunity for strong two years of growth. In terms of the overall franchise direction, I don\u2019t think you should read into this a dramatic change in franchise direction other than it will be driven around live service as the nature of our industry now. It will be cutting edge. It will be high fidelity. It will be doing things in the context of multi-play and social play and competition that Battlefields to this point have not done. And we do believe it will be a really, really exciting title in FY \u201822. Blake Jorgensen : Other things, Stephen is a lot of investors, I don\u2019t think fully appreciate the depth of our catalog business. As Andrew mentioned, Battlefield V, we want to continue to have that as a critical part of our catalog. You all might be surprised, but we have sold over 33 million copies of Star Wars Battlefront I and Battlefront II combined. That\u2019s a huge tale for our business going forward. And so we\u2019re very conscious as to how we think about staging when our games come out. And I think people get used to the annual cadence of sports, which works really well in sports, but we want to be careful on some of these other franchises that we give them the long life that they deserve inside our business and can generate great returns for us over a long period of time. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Berg with Berenberg. Robert Berg : Hi. Thanks. I\u2019m really looking to dig a bit deeper in VOLTA and some of the early trends you may be seeing there particularly interested in two areas. I guess the first is clearly you\u2019ve seen excellent Ultimate Team KPIs in the period, but how much time a player spending in VOLTA versus your expectations, is it any more or less? And also interested in the appeal with any of some of the vanity items. Have you noticed particularly interested in customizing, any thoughts on setting? And a quick follow-on question if I can, Ultimate Team player growth, but in your opinion with any of this due to VOLTA or just general underlying growth there? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : There was a lot in there I will do my best. First, we\u2019re very happy with VOLTA. Again and what we\u2019ve talked about over the years is our objective around our FIFA franchise more broadly as we think about FIFA is our platform. And how can we build features that attract new audiences to the game? We did that with the journey with story mode for a number of years. We did that with the World Cup content last year and we\u2019re doing that with VOLTA this year with the express purpose of bringing new fans into the game and reigniting the passions of laps fans, who may be not applied FIFA for some time. As a result of that, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, VOLTA is the second most played mode in the game. And games across the board engagement across the board is up in FIFA. So we\u2019re very, very happy about that. In terms of what impact that has on Ultimate Team. What we do continually discover is that Ultimate Team as a mode with these core motivations of collection and competition and social interaction at the very core, often our players ultimately find their spending most of the time. And so, even as we brought players into the game around the journey, even as we brought players into the game around the World Cup content last year, and even as we bring plays into the game around VOLTA this year, we do see a positive impact that has on Ultimate Team over time as players come together with their friends and engage in what is, one of the most fun parts of the FIFA experience. And so our expectation is that we will continue to drive that growth. That Ultimate Team, all the work done in Ultimate Team in of itself drove growth, but the combination of that in bringing new fans through VOLTA effectively drove our Ultimate Team performance. And you should expect it will continue think about our FIFA franchise and our Madden franchise in this way around building new modes to bring people in, and then helping them find their friends in the modes they love the most. Robert Berg : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum : Hey guys, good afternoon. So, you guys have talked extensively on the audience metrics for Apex. And you know that the weekly players were outperforming close to Season 3 launch versus Season 2. Can you comment on the motivation trends you\u2019re seeing there may be that gives you some conviction around growth in fiscal 2021? And then I guess separately, could you update us on your plans with Google Stadia? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Sure. So, I\u2019ll start on the first one and then Andrew can talk about Google. So, I think the key is you\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re seeing positive monetization trends. We\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s going and that\u2019s why we reiterated where our original guidance was. The key with Apex as any live service is, test and learn, test and learn. So, as Andrew described, we are continuing to add new events in each season to try to understand the spending patterns and what people like to spend money on and how much they\u2019ll spend, and will then tune those events overtime. So, there\u2019s going to be holiday themes events like the Halloween event that\u2019s going on now. There are going to be competitive style events. There are going to be gameplay style events, and then events associated with new characters or as you saw in this season or new map. All of that is along the lines of continuing to try to grow and build the number of players, the weekly average users, the frequency of play and the monetization that falls out of all those combined together. And that is a process that we\u2019ve done over the last 11 years on Ultimate Team. And I think we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at we\u2019re pretty excited about how we\u2019re doing that with Apex. So, more to come, but I think we\u2019re heading in a very positive path there. On the Stadia, update? Andrew Wilson : Yeah. On Stadia, no updates right now on Stadia. We\u2019ve got some old things coming, both in terms of our own tests, we\u2019re running as part of project Atlas and on the public infrastructure that we\u2019re being very happy about, and with some other cloud partners, who are launching some things in the future. Drew Crum : Okay, thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Mario Lu : Hey, guys. Couple of questions, one on FIFA and one on mobile. So, glad to hear that FIFA Ultimate Team bookings is still expected to grow double digits next year. And you mentioned both as a number two mode, but I don\u2019t believe you currently monetize in that mode, as all the cosmetic items can only be earned by playing versus spending money. So, is there a possibility in the future to include a battle path or some friendly monetization mechanism in this mode as well? And on mobile, any overall thoughts on partnering with overseas companies like Tencent to help develop your mobile titles? And would that be included in your bucket of two titles from third parties next year? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : So, on VOLTA, yes, we\u2019re seeing strong engagement in the visual content and the aesthetic content. We don\u2019t have a focus on the monetization of that content this year. As we have done over the years, the first objective is to attract new players. I think we\u2019ve done that very well so far. The second objective is to drive deep engagement of that player base overtime. And then typically, once you put those two things together, it ultimately drives monetization, but that\u2019s not our focus this year. Blake Jorgensen : And just a couple of clarifications on your second question. So, we said double digits growth in the quarter for FIFA not for next year. I don't know what we're doing for next year. We're very excited that we can continue to grow. That's what we said. But we didn't give any sort of sizing on any of the products for next year. I will say that the double digit growth is healthy double digit growth. So I'm not talking about 11% here. We're 10%, we're talking about healthy double digit growth across both FIFA and Madden. And we're very excited about the continuation of that. And we're just reporting on that in the in the quarter. And in terms of the other two titles, those are third party console PC titles we were speaking of, not mobile titles. But you should assume that obviously for Apex mobile in China, we would use a third party. And I think as we've said, we're considering using a third party for Apex mobile globally, because obviously there could be some ability to have some economies of scale there by using one partner maybe. Mario Lu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Ryan Gee : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may. So if you look at revenue from packaged goods and full game download, it looks like that was down a little bit year-over-year, but you guys did report FIFA and Madden were up nicely in the double digits. So can you just explain the disconnect between sales in new games revenue being down and some of your new releases being up year-over-year? Was there any pressure on ASPs or was the catalog weaker? That's the first question. And I have a follow-up. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, so yeah, so full game download is actually up year-over-year 11%. So 275 million from 157 a year ago. The strength in that was driven by Madden and FIFA. Remember there's only a few days in FIFA. And remember as well FIFA, we did not ship gen 3 FIFA this year, it's the first year we've stopped selling gen 3 FIFA. So you can imagine there was some downward pressure on gen three. We also added PS4 into the subscription. And so you can imagine there was also some people playing FIFA through the subscription. And so we still see growth with those factors is pretty impressive. We are seeing you know, obviously, some of the older titles probably are dropping off even though they tend to sell well as full game downloads, but they're always an age, you know, on those so something like, you know, a FIFA 18 that someone might still buy as a full game download because they wanted the World Cup mode. You're seeing less of that. But overall, we saw growth across all the core franchises led by FIFA and madden. Ryan Gee : Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like it maybe is more helpful for us to look at subscriptions plus packaged goods revenue plus full game downloads revenue, because people are shifting in and out of each bucket year-over-year. So maybe that's a better way to look at your business going forward? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, I think the other thing to remember is, we're now over 50% of full games being sold digitally. You have to imagine that if you're a retailer out there, you are buying less full games. And historically, the business was built on, you sold in a huge amounts of games, and then those sold out over a long period of time and you oftentimes had to support that with marketing or sales reserves. That business has changed dramatically. Retailers are either buying less or maybe not even in business. And that's because people are buying things digitally. But that flattens the sales curve in some way for some of these games. And I think you'll see that across the entire industry, not just with us. Ryan Gee : Okay, great. And then just my second question is related to DICE and Battlefield. So they're not going to have a title next year, is it fair to assume that they will still have something for next year as you think about the Star Wars Battlefront franchise if that could be some project for next year? And why would any project that you do have next year, would you not want that to benefit from the new console launches, as you mentioned that, you know, Battlefield 6 or what you might call it will benefit from a larger install base? And why wouldn't you just hold titles out everything till fiscal '22? Andrew Wilson : Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on there. One is we're not announcing anything else that DICE is doing in specifics for next year. But you should imagine with a number of live services and play that will continue to support those. And Blake talked about the ongoing strength of Battlefront II, and I reference the ongoing strength of Battlefield 5. As we think about balancing the portfolio around titles launch next year, and titles that will get the greatest boost of later on, what we have seen is a greater propensity for sports game players to play across both generations of title and we've seen that lift. And some of the things that we really want to do in the Battlefield franchise as it relates to the new fidelity that will really show up well inside of a Battlefield game. We'd like to have a deep install base for. So it really comes down to balancing a whole range of different things across our portfolio. But we feel very good about the opportunity to grow the business next year, and have a Battlefield tall in FY '22 that will grow there well and deliver on what our fan expectations will be for Battlefield game on next gen platforms. Ryan Gee : Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Hi. Thank you very much for the question and for the color for fiscal '21 and '22. I just had two if I could. And the first is just on Madden. Could you just comment a little bit about how Madden compares to FIFA from engagement and content and monetization perspective? And whether you see the opportunity to close the gap there in the next few years? And second, with rises Skywalker being the last Star Wars movie until 2022, can you talk about how the timing of theatrical content affects your Star Wars strategy going forward, if at all? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : So the Madden metrics are actually very similar to the FIFA metrics with one exception that the Madden metrics monetize better than FIFA because it's primarily a U.S. based sport and FIFA is very global. And so you obviously have economic differences. So the ARPU effectively is higher in the U.S. But the number of people who play Ultimate Team are very similar. The number of people who spend in Ultimate Team are very similar. And the timing of how people play relative to the sports season is similar. The other thing that FIFA has demand \u2013 FIFA is a longer season, right, you get a full nine plus months where you're not getting that long of a season in Madden. But we've done a good job of extending the events, post the Super Bowl to try to keep people engaged around the combine and draft and all those things that transpire. And we're stretching that engagement out. And so \u2013 but you know, even with hockey, we see similar patterns across the Ultimate Team. It's really at the end of the day, the revenue is driven by one the size of the game. Obviously, FIFA larger because it's a global game and two by the local economics around how much people are willing to spend relative to their overall spend patterns. The second question? Andrew Wilson : On the Star Wars piece, so well the rise of Skywalker is the last in this particular film set. You know, Disney had talked about having extraordinarily robust plans around that franchise over time. What we talked about was, you know, The Mandalorian coming with Disney plus the new movie And Galaxy's Edge in theme parks. And so our expectation is that in partnership with Disney, we will get the benefit of the ongoing plans around the continued development and provision of great content experiences for Star Wars fans for many years to come. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we have time for one final question. Your question comes from the line as Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey : Hi Andrew. Great quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think last question like you gave a little bit more granularity on active players, it's 8 to 10 million weekly after season. You could update, that sounds like high, just want to confirm that? And then on your 300 million to 400 million for the year, that you reiterated. Can you give us some perspective where you are trending within that range as we sort of set the stage for growth for fiscal '21? Then I have a quick follow-up. Blake Jorgensen : I can't give you any more than the range. But I just remind people that 300 million to 400 million is a small portion of 5.125 billion, so don't over index on it. Because if it was three and a quarter versus 3.75 versus 400, I don't think that's going to make a break the year. In terms of the user profile, I think Andrew mentioned that was very similar weekly average users still in that 8 to 10 million range. We're very happy with that. That's extremely robust. And you know one of the largest games that we've ever seen inside our portfolio and that continues on. It's very engaged and community. And, you know, you'll continue to see us add things that drive engagement like esports and obviously more content. And we feel like it's tracking as we would have thought. Mike Hickey : Good. I guess the second question from me is, as you sort of gave us a perspective of '21, '22 fiscal, did see anything BioWare, or from BioWare, or Star Wars, Star Wars related IP games and development for console PC over the next couple of years, or if you think that or we should just assume that likely is going to expire? And then on BioWare I think Dragon Age is going to go up, any thoughts on that studio post Anthem looking at future releases? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, I mean, you should assume that there's, you know, Dragon Age out there, and we talked about it publicly that it's in the works and probably comes after fiscal '22. But, you know, we typically don't give multiyear guidance this early in the year or multiyear guidance period. So I don't want to start giving '23 guidance now that I've started a hint on '22. But you should assume it's out there and plans are underway for that product, as well as some other products. There's some other Disney stuff that might drop into \u2013 Star Wars stuff that might drop into '22 or maybe even earlier, but with more to come on that. We're still highly engaged around the Disney license. Believe it or not, we are close to a $1 million on Star Wars : The Old Republic, revenue from the start of its history. So you know, it's a business that just keeps on going. And we like those types of businesses and we're going to continue to layer those in and clearly Star Wars is part of that process. Mike Hickey : Thanks a lot. Blake Jorgensen : All right. Thank you everyone. We'll talk to everybody, either between now and the end of next quarter or the end of next quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your call. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Chantal. Welcome to EA's third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we've posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks and audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q4 fiscal 2020 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, May the 5th, 2020. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.

During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts, with new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The Sims 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY 2020. What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games, our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry and we're expanding to more distribution channels, so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players, made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi : Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later, spanning all three trilogies and more, critics have re-reviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional and the Celebration Edition helped to drive performance at Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars : The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilm. It's nearly one year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season three was bigger than season two, with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY 2021 and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends global series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio. It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA Football brought an all new dimension to FIFA 20 and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3. FIFA 20 is also the number one most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch two major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with a prestigious South American club tournaments CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana as well as the E-Libertadores a new expansion to our FIFA 20 global series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3. In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game Discover University continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community. As did the surprise addition of the child from the Mandalorian series on Disney+ just before the holidays. Meanwhile PvZ : Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world. Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden to Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner in indie content and some more surprises to come. Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry it is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. With content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. With the strength of our IP and live services we're well-positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on three major platforms and coming to Steam in FY 2021, we're expanding our leadership in high-value low friction subscriptions for more players. And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players, and continuing our growth into FY 2021. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks Andrew. EA successfully launched three games last quarter : Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and of course, Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to eight. Launching eight major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons, and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan favorite reinforcements, exotic planets, and epic new ways to play across three cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched three seasons of content including three new legends, five in-game events, three town takeovers, and a whole new map of six new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works; we had another great quarter with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months. EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that combined with a positive true-up this year creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our two-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game. Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio, with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on the year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends, but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team. Growth in FIFA online in Asia was also extremely strong. Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales, plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. Turning to guidance, we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the two new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year with broad-based strength this year, offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability, even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across our broad range of genres. We're launching four sports titles including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises; four other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we'll also publish four titles globally from smaller developers. Finally we expect two new mobile titles to make it into soft launch. We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leveraged the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22 plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high quality entertainment for our players. Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. We're delivering for our players and our business is growing. Our foundation is great IP that excites and engages hundreds of millions of players. We've added the breadth and depth of our portfolio with great games like Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order and the innovation in FIFA, Madden and our ongoing franchise is helping us reach new fans and grow our total player base. We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises, new IP, new partner indie titles and some other surprises in FY 2021 and beyond. Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to four franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors. We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thanks, gentlemen for taking the question. Looking at the past two Star Wars games, one was a massive multiplayer; one was obviously a big single player. Seems like sales numbers initially are roughly the same but one's got live services, one doesn't. How has that shaped the way you think about future game design as we head into the next console with a big focus on live services? Andrew Wilson : Great question. And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play; inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base and we think about each of the cohorts within that we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand particularly with Star Wars is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction competition and multiplayer is really important for a large part of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is it also is that inspiration and escape model that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base. Andrew Uerkwitz : And if I could just ask one follow-up. As we think about live services, but also more distribution channels more -- easier hopefully cheaper marketing. Should we expect EA to launch more than eight games when we look out three, four, five years or is kind of like is eight a good number? Andrew Wilson : I would start by saying eight is a lot. If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is this also has a layering effect. So, as we launch games that have live services that last one, two, three, and in some cases, four and five years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think eight is probably a pretty good number. Some years there might be a few more of that, some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good. The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third-parties and Indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content. And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and Indie developers. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. And what I would add to Andrew's comment is remember one of the major strengths of our business is a deep catalog. And a deep catalog is based on not just this year's games or last year's games, but maybe even games from two or three or four years ago. And we sometimes see north of $1 billion in catalog sales in the following year. That's very powerful to us. It's very profitable. And it is critical in continuing to maintain the brands that we have built. And fans will come into games at many different levels either through direct purchase or through subscriptions. And that deep bench is something that creates a lot of value which I'm not sure people always think about as we're thinking about the value of the overall business. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Thanks gentlemen and congrats on the quarter. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks. Chris Evenden : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matt Cost : Hi guys, it's Matt on for Brian. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the mobile business. It seems like you made some great progress, obviously, on constant currency growing year-on-year. Can you talk about sort of what you're seeing in that business and maybe any thoughts you're having on potentially partnering with other mobile app developers and some of your competitors have seen some success recently following the strategy like that particularly in terms of going in markets like Asia. And then if you could just quickly an update on Project Atlas? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So, obviously, rolling mobile out in China, you need to have a partner. And we're -- as we've said in the prepared remarks today that we're working with a partner there and we're very excited about the opportunity. That partner is also helping us develop a mobile Apex for the globe. And -- well, more to come on that in terms of timing, but that's also a big upside for us. We have not built a lot into our forecast for next year on that, because the timing is always uncertain. But we do believe that there's a lot of opportunity there. Obviously, we'll also do a PC version of Apex in China through that same partner. But we will selectively use partners where possible. We have some great studios. We think we can continue to build great games. But where possible, where a partner can either increase the time to market, or help us in markets where we don't necessarily have the ability to go to market ourselves, like China, we will use partners. And more to come on Apex and any other titles that might fit in that. Andrew Wilson : Just a couple of other thoughts. We've talked in previous calls about kind of a three-pronged strategy around mobile, the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that may be some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that. I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in an area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven't been as focused on. The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well. And then third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. On Project Atlas, the other part of your question, you'll continue to hear more from us about streaming and other components of Atlas. We're in tight connection and conversations with all of the players that are doing streaming. We're very excited about where it's going and the potential, as well as how we can continue to improve the tools that people use inside of the subscription models that we put in place. So a simple reminder, our goal is to be on every platform and to offer our great products to consumers, wherever they want to play them as long as we can play -- provide them at a quality level that we're comfortable with. So you're going to hear and see a lot more in the next coming year. Matt Cost : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open. Raymond Stochel : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Is there anything that you can discuss as far as VOLTA. Can you give us an update on monetization for VOLTA. And then, any more details on FIFA Ultimate Team being up double digits this call. Is that like-for-like as far as first launch? And then, what would be driving that growth? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : We're very happy with VOLTA. VOLTA brought in a whole set of new players and engage them in new and interesting ways. As we've also talked about a lot in past calls, as we think about building live services, we really think about building engagement first and monetization to follow. As I say, I think that what the team did with VOLTA this year is really, really strong. They've taken some great learning from feedback they've received from the community and we'll continue to build on that in the years to come. And while we don't have any announcements yet on monetization, a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services. So we're excited about what that might bring. Blake Jorgensen : And what I would say on Ultimate Team and this is not just FIFA, this is Madden and this is NHL and our other games. The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we're running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play. People won't play Ultimate Team if they are not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year either refining existing events or adding new events and that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy that social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services. Chris Evenden : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerrick Johnson : Hey, good afternoon. Two questions. First gross margin. Maybe you could provide us with the puts and takes, the bridge from last year to this year? And then also on the other titles that you did have guidance for, any update to that guidance for those titles? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. So gross margin's really simple. We sold more Madden, more FIFA and more Star Wars Jedi than we expected. And all three of those are royalty properties, so we had to pay royalty on them. Royalty gets booked in gross margin. That's a good problem to have. I'd take that all day long, because obviously it's driving the overall business and the profitability of the business. So nothing more than that. It's pretty straightforward. I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that. And we've also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield's coming the year after that, which should also drive growth the following year. And we see that as a big positive for as we've said the continued plan to try to have a strong growth, top line bottom line cash flow as we go forward. Gerrick Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. Your line is open. Alex Giaimo : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to dig into Apex aspirations a bit more without getting too bogged down into the F 2020 or F 2021 guide specifically how should investors be thinking broadly about the growth aspirations for that franchise. I think you've mentioned in the past that you view it as a 10-year franchise and it's obviously early, but should we think about it sort of as a modest straight-line grower moving forward or is it a bit more lumpy? And then just given the free-to-play nature of that game hoping you can just update us on how the profitability of Apex compares to the broader profitability of EA as a whole. Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, it's good questions. I mean as I think Andrew said we're just getting into our one-year anniversary in the game which is fantastic. We've been very pleased with where the game is. The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise. We will continue that journey no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago. And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean it's just an incredible job they've done. It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, six months ago, we probably wouldn't have known and we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain. But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it. What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that I they go back seven and a half years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said, we will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors. And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information, we're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense. We'll try to give you as best guidance as we can. We want to grow the business. We think it's got a long history to it, but more to come and we're very excited and very optimistic about where the opportunities can go with Apex. Andrew Wilson : Just a small add. At a game level, as we look at the industry and the games that have actually lasted a decade or more, things like League of Legends, things like CS : Go, things like DOTA 2 to continue to engage huge populations of players around the world. There's really kind of three core pillars of those games; really compelling and identifiable characters, a truly compelling world, and competitive skill-based highly social game plan that continues to evolve and emerge over time as players continue to get better in the game. They are the three core tent poles of Apex Legends as again and as we think about the year -- the next year and the year after and we add new geographies and we had new platforms, again, as what Blake said, it's hard to predict exactly how that will grow, but our belief is that we have growth ahead and we're very, very encouraged and excited by the fact that the team gets better and better at answering needs of the players. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2. We expect Season 4 will grow again and we're excited about what will come. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. And you mentioned our comments in the past around, we're trying to build a long term franchise. At the end of the day, we would much rather have something that lasts for many, many years -- doesn't -- is not a boom and bust. And that's how we're trying to design the business. The team is very aligned with that. And if it can turn into essentially an annual shooter for us as part of our franchises. We think that's huge value to the overall company. So that's how we're looking at it and how we're approaching it. And we think everyone's aligned around that and more to come. Alex Giaimo : Thanks, guys. Chris Evenden : Thanks. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Cohen with Stephens. Your line is open. Jeff Cohen : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about how big of a driver Jedi : Fallen Order was for new subscribers to origin access? And then, broadly, just, can you talk about how churn has trended within your subscription products? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So remember that it's the premier subscription that gets frontline titles. Which is only part of the overall origin access model and not in the Sony or Microsoft program. Obviously, it added to it, but its early days. So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out, because they're still playing the game. We have not seen big changes in churn. It's been a big question for us, because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that that will also bring people in. And the most important part is -- what we found out is, people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription. And that's a huge win, as we start to build people into new, either games or genres or sports that they've never played before, because it only increases the growth of their interest in playing great games. Jeff Cohen : Thanks, Blake. Congrats on the quarter. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is open. Matthew Thornton : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Without getting into maybe any specific dates or even titles specifically, maybe to give us a little more update just on kind of how you're feeling about the pipeline, maybe, relative to where we were 6, 12 months ago that the products that are out there across the various studios. Any color there would be helpful. And then, just coming back to Sims and Apex in particular, Blake, I think, you had talked about those franchises doing, call it, $300 million to $400 million for the year. Are those still reasonable ending points for those franchises? Thanks, guys. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would say, they're definitely reasonable franchise points for those franchises and both are doing -- continue to do well. The Sims added an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well. And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow, as more and more people come in. And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs and it just builds on that social network that we've effectively created inside The Sims. And we'll see similar behavior with Apex even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network. No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year. Obviously next year we're going to -- we've said we'd most likely add at least one new sports game. And we have some third-party games we will have in for next year, and a couple of things that we haven't yet announced. But as we said earlier, we're very focused on growing both top line and bottom line both next year and the following year as well as future years. But I just want to give people a sense that we've got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward. And, obviously, we're also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future plus some continued new franchises that we'll continue to add and live services associated with all those. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Just as a kind of an add to that, again we benefit from a large number of very well-established studios with great teams with a track history of delivering really high-quality content. So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE and Respawn, and our EA SPORTS studios there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more. I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. And you guys, kind of, imagine and you've seen this historically in console transitions. As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more. And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation, not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last what 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up. They get too focused on the short-term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power. Matthew Thornton : Appreciate the color guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ryan Gee : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple on live services. So first very encouraged by the outperformance of Star Wars Jedi from Respawn. So, you guys now have a large player base into which you could generate some additional revenue. So, what is the opportunity ahead either for to generate live services revenue from that in fiscal 2022 and/or maybe some sort of add-on content pack for that game? And then as it relates to live services from Ultimate Team, the sequential acceleration to double-digits last quarter, are you guys able to see how much of that is a function of just easier year-over-year comps to the Ultimate Team business versus execution getting players further down the conversion funnel and getting higher spend out of existing payers. Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, let me hit the Ultimate Team one first and then maybe Andrew can address the Star Wars Jedi. Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus once again trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they're excited in. And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events, and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team. I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team and we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport. These are hard-core sports fans and this is what they want to do and that's why they engage in Ultimate Team. Andrew Wilson : On Star Wars, no announcements of anything at this point, but what I would say is you're right we have a very, very strong player base a very engaged player base who feel like what they've just had the ability to experience as one of the most compelling Star Wars experiences of their life of any formal media. I would also highlight it is a single-play game. So, any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends. But this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play. We're excited by what we're going to come up with and in the meantime I also think that this will be one of the strongest catalog sellers for this company over the coming years and will almost certainly help continue to grow our subscription as it moves into our various subscription offers across platforms. Chris Evenden : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Hey guys. Two questions on my end. One on the Switch and one on Sims. So, Nintendo today announced that the Switch exceeded 52 million units shipped worldwide which is similar or more than the Xbox One. So, therefore, should we expect EA to publish more titles on the Switch going forward? As I understand currently there's only three EA titles on the platform including Unravel, Fe, in the legacy version of FIFA. And then secondly on The Sims, the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences. And Facebook recently actually announced that they're coming out with Horizons, a social experience in VR and that kind of reminds me of the Sims online which launched 18 years ago. So, any thoughts on relaunching an online version of the franchise, given its large popularity? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : So let me hit the Switch question and then I'll go into the AR question on Sims. So we are very pleased with how well the Nintendo has done with Switch. I mean, people love the platform. They enjoy it, it's great. And remember there are a lot of people that have both, the Xbox and a Switch or a PlayStation and Switch, because it, in many ways, provides a different experience, particularly a way to access great Nintendo software. We are always looking and discussing with Nintendo what else we can put on the platform. And as you can imagine, as the platform grows, our interest in adding content grows for that platform. But we're also conscious of the fact that the top-selling titles by a long shot or all the Nintendo software, which is fabulous software, but it helps us balance sort of the realities of how big our markets can be there. But trust that we're looking at that. You will hear some more things in the future about what we're putting on the platform. And we're very pleased with how it's grown alongside the growth of both Sony and Microsoft's platforms. Andrew Wilson : Great question on the Sims. A little known fact, I guess, for many -- the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally. As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier, inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these type and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition. But a few things are in fact true over the years. One is that, The Sims community has continued to grow. And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast, not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes. And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self improvement, motivations, that this notion social interaction and competition, like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims Online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that, it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come. Blake Jorgensen : And the one thing that we have with The Sims, that we have with all of our games, but probably the most with the Sims is, its incredibly engaged community. And The Sims team has done an amazing job interacting with the community and trying to understand what they want. And so, it allows us to develop expansion packs, additions, whatever it is, or game approaches, that is really coming from the community and we will continue to encourage that. So as we see interest or demand that allows us to go chase that as we develop the product. And I think that's an amazing thing that you don't necessarily have in all games and The Sims is a leader there for us and it makes it such a fabulous opportunity to continue to feed what the community wants. Mario Lu : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mike Ng : Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just had one on unit sales. If you look at full game downloads plus packaged goods, it looked like that was up $168 million year-on-year. And it seems like the key moving parts for Star Wars, Need for Speed more than offsetting Battlefield V. I was just wondering if there are any other factors to consider whether those were catalog sales being better or worse or pricing or the digital shift impacting unit sales that could help us think about things that may have impacted units for the quarter? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. Well, clearly digital sales continues to grow. I would -- I'd say remember Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays. And live services, obviously, was a big driver. But if you thought -- if you think about our expectations as we mentioned we over delivered on Star Wars, we probably under delivered slightly on Plants vs. Zombies but that's one that will sell well over a long period of time. So in a relatively small title so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's, kind of, as we expected. We did as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that this year we had stronger pricing than we have in the past and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past. And that was part of our strategy, but it also helped across the board as we look -- as you look at overall revenue. Mike Ng : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open. Drew Crum : Thank you guys. Can you update us on the progress you've made with FIFA Online 4 in China during the current fiscal year, and how big of a role that plays growth for fiscal 2021? And when you get back to the $200 million annual run rate? And then separately with some of the management changes you've made at DICE and I guess specifically Vince becoming the Director of the LA office, how involved will he in Respawn be with the development of the next Battlefield game? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. So quickly on the on FIFA Online, we're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China. That has not impacted the business that much. In fact we're pretty close to getting back to our historical level. We've shut off FIFA Online in Korea. And FIFA Online 4 there has responded very well. We had strong growth year-over-year in the quarter for that and it was mainly driven by Korea. We will play it over the next few quarters as to when and how we're going to shut it down in China. But we're conscious that we don't want to disrupt the consumer there. And right now both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace. So more to come on that. But we're pretty close to back to where we were and we're really excited about the growth that's coming off of FIFA Online 4 both in Southeast Asia and in Korea that we're seeing and even in China. So, more to come there, but that's kind of the quick answer. Andrew Wilson : Good question on Vince and Battlefield V. You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive, and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on. And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned focused push against both quality and execution. With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things and we're very excited about those things and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that. And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call. I'm really excited about what that team is doing. And David Rota who is leading the studios in Europe now is also having a really strong impact and the team is going to do some pretty amazing things. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Mike Hickey : Hey Andrew, Blake, Chris congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on Vince that you kind of answered it, but maybe you can go a layer deeper. Obviously, he's a super talent to guy. I mean his success in the shooters truly genres is truly remarkable with Medal of Honor, Call of Duty : Titanfall, Apex Legends, obviously founded Respawn. I guess just your thoughts on Respawn ex-Vince how that studio continues to behave and the leadership there? And then at the new DICE studio, it sounds like they're going to rebrand that or rename it. You mentioned that perhaps he's inheriting some games in development, therapy development preproduction, but I'm curious if we can look forward to sort of AAA from Vince in the shooter genre emerging in two to three years. And then I guess broadly speaking new consoles, Blake, great to hear your excitement on new consoles coming to the market and what that means. I share that. It's also seemingly a good time to come out with new IP. So, thoughts, I guess, broadly on how you think about new IP on the front end to console cycle? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Just to be clear Vince hasn't stopped working at Respawn. He's still running Respawn. We're asking him to do more and part of what Laura Miele has been doing is trying to make sure Vince has all the resources that he needs. And so giving him the chance to oversee DICE LA also gives them the opportunity to pull resources into the Respawn team if he needs to. So, there are probably, I don't know, how many new IP ideas we're incubating. So, more to come on all of that. Everyone's pretty excited. But I don't want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince's remit means in any way that he's not overseeing Respawn. He has got a great team there. He's got a great management team there. We continue to bolster that team. But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about he and the whole team as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team hopefully has found out is that, we're actually not bad guys and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, didn't mean to say bad guys, because Laura's a really good lady. But I just want people to know. I mean, we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, its people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best managers wherever they are. And that we've got a collection of quite a few of those people and that's what we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year. You don't put out the best of biggest sports games in the world year-after-year on time and on budget if you don't have amazing people doing that. And Chris is telling me I got it shut it off, because we're out of time. But there was one last -- one was one part of your question Mike that we didn't get to. We lost you. All right. All right, everyone. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Talk to everyone next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Suzanne and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q4 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thank you, Suzanne. Hi, everyone. Welcome to EA\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me from their homes today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings, our earnings release, our financial model, and our earnings slides are available at ir.ea.com. We will post an audio replay, a copy of these prepared remarks and a transcript after the call. With regards to our calendar, our Q1 fiscal 2021 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, July 30, 2020. Many of the usual opportunities we have to meet with investors, such as conferences, are unavailable at this time. We\u2019re building out a program of virtual tours to reach as many of you as possible over the coming weeks and months, directly and through partnering with sell-side analysts. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. And note in particular that these forward-looking statements may be affected by risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q and our earnings release for a discussion of risks, including those related to COVID-19 that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 5, 2020, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. This is a challenging time for everyone. As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We\u2019re here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus first and foremost has been on the health and wellbeing of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I\u2019ll start by sharing a bit about our actions to support our employees around the world. We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events, and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work-from-home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we\u2019ve put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing. We continue to be in a work-from-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees, and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We\u2019re planning for the return to take place over an extended period as we make longer term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward. Moving to our results, we finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full-year revenue and earnings above our previously-raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I\u2019ll touch on a few examples from the year. EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far, with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension to the game, and FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations. Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history. Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019, and continues to grow as an innovative, long-term service for players. It\u2019s been continually recognized as one of the best multiplayer experiences available, and with each new season of content, Respawn have been delivering more of what players love -- from lore, to new Legends, to in-game events. Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, Season 4 was already outperforming each of the two prior seasons, and the Old Ways event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately two times the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community. Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for the first title in an entirely new franchise. It\u2019s a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply-engaging and original Star Wars experience. The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience, and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else on the market, and FY20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in The Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests. With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rising usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We\u2019re humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time. In part, this has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams, and our technology investments across the Company. For more than five years, we\u2019ve been investing in a single technology infrastructure, architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That\u2019s enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity. But the real story is the people of Electronic Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They\u2019ve come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period, in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we\u2019ve been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment, where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date. We\u2019ve had a deep focus on our players through this time. Our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content for the NFL Draft, and new additions to Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our Stay Home, Play Together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March. Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we\u2019ve delivered dozens of Stay & Play programs to date, from special community livestreams and giveaways, to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our esports teams launched a fully cloud-based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We\u2019ve since conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay & Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 relief that brought together top European Clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We\u2019ve now executed, or plan to execute in the coming months, more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events. This global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we\u2019ve increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers to food drives and much more, and we\u2019re supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts for making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we\u2019ve responded well to this global challenge, and we\u2019re in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content, and supporting our communities when and where they need it most. Looking to FY21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 14 new titles to players this fiscal year. That includes four new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and one more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we\u2019re excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon. Our FY21 plans also include four more games drawing on the breadth of our IP, from Command & Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for our console and PC. We\u2019ll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA Partners, and two new mobile titles leveraging top IP that we\u2019ll bring to players worldwide. With our teams\u2019 expertise in live services, we\u2019re also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. In addition to our new EA SPORTS games, we\u2019ll continue delivering fans\u2019 daily connection to sports through our live services, even if the real-world leagues and teams aren\u2019t back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content in FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones. This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We\u2019ll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam. And we\u2019re also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans, with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year. As we begin FY21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as the COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners, and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned timelines. We\u2019re thankful for the extraordinary people that we have at Electronic Arts, and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities, and our Company. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019ve had a strong year. But it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I\u2019d like to focus on the impact we\u2019re seeing on our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and wellbeing of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the Company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven\u2019t yet solved all the problems, but, for example we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event; Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch; and we expect to see the next Sims expansion and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA. Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you\u2019ve heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we\u2019ve seen a corresponding large rise in live services revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter prove the value of the live services path we\u2019ve been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this, to meet player needs in a variety of ways. The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games, with sales actually above where we would expect them to be at this time of year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog, and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009, compared to only 20% last year. Turning to our results. I\u2019ll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion, cost of revenue $1.37 billion, operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including one-time net tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion. Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year, driven by strength across our business. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenue for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter-end, we have completed our two-year, $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty in the market and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution, our business today is extremely strong. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes, with $600 million maturing in March 2021, and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion, with the beat versus expectations driven by the Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live services net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago, offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly through fiscal 2020. Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year, driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year, driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, we are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we\u2019re providing to our players through live services, and the new games we have on our slate. The market outlook is uncertain, but we\u2019re basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid single digits in calendar 2020, with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are currently performing extremely well, it is not yet known when professional sports might resume, nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are proving to be a popular competitive outlet for football, soccer and hockey fans. There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games. And the guidance I\u2019m about to provide is predicated on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios which will be announced in coming quarters. We\u2019re not seeing material impact on our FY21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles, where we have less control. Finally, with regard to the potential impact of the recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient, as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss three changes we are making with regards to reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net, to align with industry practice. Finally, we are updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales, in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We\u2019ve published more details on our IR website. Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember FY20\u2019s GAAP EPS includes a one-time tax benefits of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%. With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year, with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes, and higher variable compensation, and lower interest income. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services, plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we\u2019d note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties introduced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020; and full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2021, up 1% on a like-for-like basis. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% in fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense control in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we\u2019re seeing very strong engagement and net bookings growth to date, we\u2019re only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control, thus we are taking a more cautious view than normal. As usual, we\u2019ve presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We\u2019ve made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing. But it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year, nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition. I\u2019ll finish by personally thanking everybody at the Company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to delivery games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Blake. We feel very fortunate at Electronic Arts to have the opportunity to bring games and entertainment to people around the world. That\u2019s true every day, but it\u2019s especially true during this unprecedented situation. Our ability to fulfill important motivations for players, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, creation, and learning has brought more people to connect and spend time in our games in the recent weeks and months of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. We\u2019ve seen games be a source of joy for hundreds of millions of players. We will now look to be delivering for these players for a long time to come. Our focus continues to be on delivering great games and content through the breadth and depth of our portfolio, in our ongoing live services, and by connecting more players through our games via more distribution channels and platforms. With the incredible determination of our teams, we\u2019ve been able to keep producing new experiences from our homes around the world. And as we continue to work through this global challenge, we plan to continue delivering a lot of new games, new experiences, and exciting ways to play this year. How we live, work and play will undoubtedly be changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We\u2019re humbled that games have been part of how people are coming together. We will continue to serve our people, our players, and our local communities by helping them in any way that we can. To everyone listening in to this call, please be safe and be well. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Matthew Thornton : Hey Andrew, hey Blake. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. You guys have talked a little bit about Battlefield, being pushed out to fiscal \u201822. Wonder if you could maybe just give us any other color or comments or thoughts on other kind of pipeline projects as we look out in the out years. And then, secondly on Apex, just wondering if you could give us any incremental thoughts or color around the launch on mobile, progress in China, any minimum guarantee that might fall into this year? Any color you can offer there would be helpful. Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Let me take the kind of out year projects and maybe Apex in Asia. First, I would say, Battlefield is progressing very, very well. We\u2019re excited by what the team\u2019s doing. And again, in the context of the work-at-home environment that had been truly inspirational and how that continued to develop great entertainment in the context of our Battlefield universe. So, I\u2019m excited for when next year comes. In terms of, specific announcements around what might be coming in out years, I would tell you that we don\u2019t have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we\u2019re going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS branded properties, bringing some new properties back, over the coming years. We\u2019ve talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We\u2019re excited about that. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019ve got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had the level of execution that we\u2019re seeing around the development of launch of content and the management of ongoing live services than we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you I\u2019m very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time. With respect to Apex, I think, it falls into that category. We don\u2019t have any specifics or announced beyond what we\u2019ve already talked about, other than to say, I just saw the results of our Season 5 trailer for Apex today. So, we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate and is the top trending video on YouTube games today. That in conjunction with some game play we saw in our Apex mobile title, I feel very excited about that franchise overall. Blake Jorgensen : Just to add, trust that we are well along the way with our partner in Asia on Apex mobile and PC. But, we\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s going on. And we have a very, very small number in there for this fiscal year. So, I don\u2019t see any risk, if that takes longer. But, the partner is working very hard to get it out as fast as possible. And I echo what Andrew just said. If you check out the trailer, on Season 5, I think what you\u2019ll see is we continue to evolve this live service. And remember, this is a live service and it is why it\u2019s so exciting. And we\u2019re adding interesting, exciting new content. And then, as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home. And I think that\u2019s an important message that shouldn\u2019t be ignored, because it is not easy. And what we\u2019ve proven to ourselves, we didn\u2019t think it was possible, but it\u2019s proving that, at least so far -- we know there\u2019s risks going forward, but it\u2019s amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home. And, just check out the trailer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan, UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two questions. I think, investors have struggled with sort of understanding maybe the rate of change of engagement and monetization. Is there a way to sort of frame either specific titles or across your portfolio what you\u2019ve seen in March and April versus what historical trends have been in January and February before the new normal? And then, a bigger picture question. Are there any learnings you\u2019re getting from this period in March and April that are informing the way you\u2019re thinking about either product development or ways in which to tie engagement and monetization more broadly together, as you think about the long-term future for gaming? Thanks so much, guys. Blake Jorgensen : So, let me start with the first part. And then, Andrew can probably talk a little bit about the development piece. I think, as most people know, our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn\u2019t have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi : Fallen Order, which was strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. And, as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the ultimate team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of two things inside of EA, the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. And in a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it\u2019s incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously the level of revenue growth we saw during that timeframe. Madden on its own was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen, and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen. And much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun. And then, we\u2019re pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But, I think, people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we\u2019ve built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I\u2019ll let you, jump in on the development. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So, I would take it in three categories. One is, are there any metrics that we could point to just kind of speak to the level of elevation we\u2019ve seen. I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April, and are up 115% for Madden. Esports TV broadcast hours in U.S. in April were up 250% over last year. And April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So, we\u2019re seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think of that in two buckets. One is, just how do we think about building games going forward and how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal? Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. We had already, over the last five years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilized the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model. And some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing a commentary of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go forward basis. I also spoke to in the prepared remarks about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility at our head office, and we\u2019ll use other people\u2019s facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But, we\u2019ve been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with hosts, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we\u2019re seeing right now. As it relates to gamers. Again, I think, it\u2019s too early to tell. But, a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in prepared remarks like inspiration and escape and social connection and competition and creation and learning better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming and discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacularly they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and built relationships with friends through new games they are playing will continue to drive engagement over the long term. And our objective, of course, is to fully support them as they move through this COVID-19 phase and ensure that we\u2019re able to continue to fulfill the motivations they have, even as we get on the other side of this. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin of Needham. Your line is open. Laura Martin : Hello, there. Thanks for taking the questions. So, it sort of sounds, Andrew, from a lot of your comments that we\u2019re getting nice TAM expansion. You said Sims 4 had new and different audiences from your other games. And then, you said Apex Legends esports was up twofold audiences. I guess, my question is, do you think that one of the unintended consequences of COVID-19 is we\u2019re going to get more gender diversity and a faster move out of sort of passive programming into sort of more interactive or more lean forward programming that you guys benefit from? And then, Blake for you, Andrew was just talking about these maybe more distributors pivot towards more distributed, you\u2019ve been working on for last five years. Could you talk through what the impact on the P&L would be over maybe in 2021, a little further out maybe than the COVID-disruptive period, and how much money that might save on the P&L, if we do move to a distributed talent base system? Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Let me grab the first one and then I\u2019ll hand off to Blake. First and foremost, what we have tried to do as a company is build a broad and deep portfolio that speaks to and entertains a diverse global population. And you see that across our sports titles and Battlefield like titles and Sims titles and Apex titles that give you different experiences across different platforms, across different business models and different geographies. And that has been at the very core of our strategy as Electronic Arts. And what we are seeing through this period of time is as more people come to recognize the true joy of interactive entertainment, a the true joy of gaming, even as I think linear media has also benefited through this time. I do believe that engagement will be more consistent in interactive industry over time. I do believe we\u2019re seeing new players come in who maybe hadn\u2019t played before and who are experiencing the goodness that comes from connecting with friends in a truly interactive environment through games. We\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re excited to deliver new and interesting and innovative and creative entertainment to fans. And we\u2019re very happy to see that the whole strategy of a broad and deep portfolio that speaks to and entertains a global diverse audience is answering the needs of the global community this time. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. In terms of the expense side, it\u2019s really still early to tell. We know for the next, at least two quarters, the quarter we\u2019re in now and the following quarter, we will see virtually no travel and entertainment expenses that we would normally see. We\u2019re obviously -- both Gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together, were canceled. So, obviously, we\u2019ll see some savings there. We don\u2019t really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now. But I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices. What that looks like that could actually change expenses in the negative way. I hope not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We hope that we are going actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But, it\u2019s early days to say. But, I know at least in the near term, we will see some savings and we\u2019ve tried to reflect that in some of our guidance. But, we don\u2019t really have a sense of how long this will go. We\u2019re currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We\u2019re not going to bring everybody back on day one, and I think most companies are going through the same thing. But, I do think in this year, we\u2019re probably in a better position for not having large OpEx, because we\u2019re not hiring as much, and we\u2019re not spending as much on things like travel, but I do think the unknown is really the following years going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey of Benchmark. Mike Hickey : Two on M&A. Just curious, if you\u2019re I guess more interested in potential deals here, considering the current environment, or if you\u2019re seeing more opportunities emerge to partner or acquire smaller game companies? Then second question, and obviously, the gaming business is already looking good compared to the traditional media business. So, now, I guess, considering how you see your peers are performing, player engagement is strong, ability to continue to create content from home as you said is significant countercyclical to economic downturn. Do you think, this could sort of, I guess, reshape the perception of your business from potentially larger media companies or otherwise, and that\u2019s the catalyst for potential acquisitions over time? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Mike, it\u2019s hard to say. I mean, right now, we\u2019re working obviously, as we\u2019ve talked about, with a lot of third-party companies for titles for the coming -- this year and following year. So, that\u2019s -- for us, we stay very close to them and we\u2019re doing everything possible we can to support those companies in a tough position. But, at the same time, companies that do have games in the market are obviously doing well, similar to what you\u2019re saying with us and other public companies. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s turning a catalyst to M&A. We do feel like this will continue longer term to emphasize the fact that scale is incredibly important in this business. And maybe that turns into something which helps us with M&A going forward. Our model right now is really simple, which is stay close to all the companies we know. It\u2019s harder because you can\u2019t go meet with them face to face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, whatever it is, and make sure you\u2019re supportive, because we believe longer term that helps us potentially get a deeper partnership with them. And that\u2019s about all I can say now. And we\u2019ll see how that plays out over time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan. Zilu Pan : Hi. This is the Zilu Pan on for Alexia. Thanks for taking our question. We were just wondering if you can give us a sense of what you think spending might trend after stay-at-home orders get lifted. Any patterns you might be seeing in countries that have already eased restrictions? And then, just as a follow-up. Are there any concerns that the sports games might get a little stale without live sports events resuming in time for the fall releases? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : It\u2019s too early for us to be able to really assess any places where regulations have lifted, because I mean Shanghai is probably -- China is probably the only place we\u2019re starting to see that. So, it\u2019s early. I don\u2019t -- I think, you should assume our costs won\u2019t change versus what they\u2019ve been historically. A real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters? And I think, we will, and that\u2019s built into our guidance. But, I don\u2019t have a sense of does that last another year or more. So, I think that will take some time for us to really better understand. And as both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team? We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry. And that\u2019s our number one focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend, to make sure that that happens. In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is two things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time? Today, we see our core audience spending because they\u2019re at home more. But, does that change over time? And then,, the second challenge is, what\u2019s the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time? We know today people are engaging with sports, because that\u2019s what they love to do. If you are a sports fair, it doesn\u2019t stop. And so, the only way they\u2019re getting their sports engagement is through our games. And that\u2019s a huge benefit for us. But we don\u2019t know, because there\u2019s no precedent on this is what happens long term, if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But, we do believe that everything we\u2019re seeing now and everything we\u2019re seeing, particularly in esports, is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love. And don\u2019t forget the social part, because remember, people don\u2019t sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know, engage in that sports. And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So, we hope that that bodes for a great season going forward. But, we\u2019ve never been in a time like this before. And so, that\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing any caution from us. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And I would echo Blake\u2019s caution. But, I would also point to the amazing work our teams have done in the past and have been doing over the last couple of months. We have a long history of creating spectacular sports content. It\u2019s not actually directly dependent or reliant on the real world of sports. Ultimate Scream, Team of the Partial Season in FIFA, Zero Chill in Madden -- Ultimate Freeze in Madden Mobile. Our teams are very close to the playing communities. They interact with them deeply on a daily basis and have been truly creative and innovative, how they have put things together and delivered experiences to players through the last few months to ensure that those suppliers remain connected to the players, the teams, the leagues and the fans that they love to spend time with. I actually believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to do that for players even if sports are delayed or don\u2019t make it back this year. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo of Jefferies. Your line is open. Alex Giaimo : Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just get a general update on your relationship with the NFL. We saw a competitor agree to publish non-simulated NFL games. So, I guess, the question is, do you think there\u2019s any risk to that the NFL opens up its simulated license at some point? And then, sticking to sports, sorry, I missed this earlier, but was there any update as to your plans with the NBA live franchise? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Again, I would point to the year we just had with Madden NFL, the single biggest year in the franchise, a truly innovative developed game and an innovatively launched game in the context of how the team, development team came together and built new experiences, targeting new and younger players in the context of NFL football and how our marketing team kind of launched those experiences in multiple launches and target those multiple groups of different players. And the result is, the best year in Madden history. I would tell you, our relationship with the NFL was very, very strong. We look forward to building NFL games for many years to come. And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform. Again, when you think about gamers, the biggest -- one of the most important things for them is a sense of community and being part of such a big community, like the Madden community, whether they\u2019re playing front line 11 or 11 simulation football or they\u2019re applying the fast knockout mode that we launched this year or whether they start to play some of the new modes we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile. So, we\u2019re excited about our football future and believe that it will continue to be a strong part of our portfolio and a really strong offering for football fans for many years to come. With respect to NBA live, nothing more to announce at this, other than I would also tell you we have a great relationship with the NBA. We\u2019ve been partners with them for a very long time. I\u2019ve personally spent time with NBA at the most senior levels, talking about innovative new ways to deliver new interactive content to NBA fans that maybe aren\u2019t engaging in games today. And we\u2019ll have more to share on that in the coming months. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is now open. Drew Crum : Blake, I wondered if you could deconstruct the performance of live services during the quarter, understanding that the Apex comp was difficult. What were some of the puts and takes on the 7% decline? And I apologize if I missed any commentary on ultimate team. And then, separately, can you just comment on your expectations for your mobile business to be up 1% in fiscal \u201821 against the market you\u2019re forecasting to be up 7%? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, sure. Thanks. Good questions. So, on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last September -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so, the massive business. And then we\u2019ve settled into a regular cadence and we\u2019ve been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019re feeling very good about that. The second piece is, we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- let\u2019s call the first FUT birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event from the end of March into the first two weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content, knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it\u2019s one of the biggest events of the year. And so, you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4, compared to previous year Q4. Those were the two biggest drivers. On the positive side, Madden, both live service that Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February-March timeframe is rare, because it\u2019s post the Super Bowl, but it\u2019s been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I even said on the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We\u2019re still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But, as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so, that\u2019s kind of the puts and takes. And then, on top of that, I would say Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn\u2019t stop. And I guess, Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter-after-quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team and incredible product and amazing engagement. And so, you can say -- put it all on the Apex, last year, unbelievable benefit, and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter. Mobile, the way we\u2019ve approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch, much longer than they have historically. And so, we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is, is that we can exceed that, but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile titles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well, things like SimCity continued to perform extremely well. And while we\u2019re not growing dramatically, we\u2019re still extremely profitable across those titles. And our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix, will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Andrew Uerkwitz : One kind of big picture one very near-term, a big picture question. With so many different new platforms to launch on, should we expect sort of the cadence between titles to kind of lengthen and going forward, kind of dig into the catalog and find things that either could be brought back to life or remastered, or how does the broader platform strategy affected -- how should we think about it affecting future game development? And then, my second question, probably is more for Blake. Could you, if you could, give us some color on sort of almost -- has the sports title seen any sort of -- any sort of deterioration at all, relative to the other titles, through the month of April at all, or how should we think about the guidance on a ongoing forward basis of how you\u2019re building sort of resection, no sports, lots of sports? So, maybe any part of the day when you think sports are coming back. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Andrew, do you want to start with the first one? Andrew Wilson : Yes, absolutely. I would say, the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We\u2019ve been able -- throughout our history, we\u2019ve been able to get to platforms with more titles of high quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we\u2019re very proud of and we continue to drive against that. Six or seven years ago, we anticipated that to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time and that ultimately cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security, and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this. So, as these new platforms come online, we\u2019re able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can, who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines and actually really use our scale to our advantage and our ability to do that. And what you\u2019re seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC, Steam and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we -- and Switch. And you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers. In the context of overall time between games, I think it\u2019s different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development, but they\u2019re also entertaining significantly more, players on each release basis and holding on to those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in large services and social interaction. And so, as we think about our broader portfolio, you\u2019ll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You will continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis, things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You\u2019ll continue to see us think about games on a five and six-year time horizon. The Sims which launched the game over five years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content live services would be an example of that. And then, you\u2019ll see us launch true platform games, like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade. So, again, I would come back to, I feel good about how we have moved the Company on a technology basis that puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres, as this global playing audience continues to expand. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. And I\u2019ll try to address second part of your question. First, I would just remind everybody, which I think you all know, but, we\u2019ve just finished a year in which we raised guidance three times and delivered on that with beats every time. We just put out guidance for next year, probably -- or this year, coming year that we\u2019re in right now in probably the most uncertain time that we\u2019ve ever faced. And yet -- and we\u2019ve cautioned everyone and we\u2019ve put caveats on everything. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to transpire. But, we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both, top-line and bottom-line year-over-year. Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS. And we just provided you guys for $0.70 in EPS. And the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But, I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you\u2019re thinking about the year forward. So with that wonderful syllabically [ph] or however you say that, we will end the call. And I appreciate everybody. And most important make sure your families are healthy, you\u2019re spending time with them, and you all stay healthy as well, because we need to have you guys around to help us in the marketplace. So, thank you. Andrew Wilson : Be well, stay healthy, stay safe. Thank you. Operator : And this conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We\u2019ve long held equality, inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts, and as a company, we\u2019ve made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world.  As we\u2019ve shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers : delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more layers across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivered incredible growth in our live services, and welcomed tens of millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April. This drove the biggest first quarter in EA history, with net bookings and operating cash flow both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full-year FY21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today.  We\u2019ve seen tremendous growth over the last four months in our business and across the industry. As EA, we sit at the intersection of two fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital, and second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive. We\u2019ve seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patterns and building new friendships in our games. So while there are unknowable aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront of providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched two new games to players during the quarter - Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well-received by fans and critics and became a top- selling title on Origin and Steam, as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo Switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including two major game expansions, as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this, and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY21 and beyond, was completed with our teams working from home.  Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance through the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch quarter for Apex, and engagement in Season 5 reached the highest levels since our first new season of content. Creative in-game events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event, Lost Treasures, had more than 96 million hours played in the first two weeks. We\u2019re bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we\u2019re excited to introduce cross-play later this year so more players can engage and play together with their friends.  The world has an insatiable appetite for sports, and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection to sports, and we\u2019ve brought millions of new, returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games. Player acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1, with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. These are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA Online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date. Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year over year in Q1, and virtually every measure of Madden Ultimate Team engagement is up more than double over last year. The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms, and daily, weekly and monthly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for a first quarter. Our Sims mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of The Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming, and we\u2019re especially proud of the way it helps players find community and express themselves during culturally challenging times.  During Q1, we also launched nearly 30 titles on the Steam platform. Bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well, and by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin players to play together, we\u2019re now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing titles to Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this summer. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox One and PS4 grew quarter over quarter, with new players coming into our services to experience more great games.  It was an unprecedented first quarter of growth. Looking forward, we\u2019re also seeing strong engagement in Q2. Although it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network.  Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players in our communities for The Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come.  Building on this strength, we have exciting new titles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena which we just launched with Final Strike Games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play Live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year, and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times.  We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year? With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we\u2019ve got something for every fight fan - an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand new environments, and more fluid gameplay -- all making this the most authentic MMA game we\u2019ve ever created. Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode, and more of the Superstar X-Factor abilities that fans love, we\u2019re bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership. We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA, and when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world\u2019s leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA SQUADS and FUT Co-Op will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we\u2019re also delivering the most comprehensive update to Career Mode that we\u2019ve ever released. NHL 21 launches October 16, and we\u2019re excited about the great work from our NHL team this year, which we\u2019ll share more about soon. Then in the holiday season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation versions of FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and content for sports fans around the world.  With our cloud-based broadcasting platform for esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last four months than we did in all of calendar year 2019. Demand for our FIFA, Apex Legends and Madden esports content across major networks is unprecedented, and the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We\u2019re now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plans are to deliver three times as many broadcasted events in FY21 over last year, spanning linear and digital broadcasts, with more athlete, celebrity and fan competitions, in addition to global esports ecosystems for Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden. We also just launched The Sims Spark\u2019d on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first-ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay, alongside weekly challenges for Sims 4 players, it\u2019s an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we\u2019re very excited by the fan reaction to date.  We\u2019re also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars : Squadrons game from Motive Studios set to launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that\u2019s ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars starfighter, with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney & Lucasfilm. We\u2019re excited to add another all-new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we\u2019ve delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross-play.  Our business is strong and it\u2019s been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times amidst the pandemic, and we are deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players \u2013 and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment every step of the way \u2013 even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support and for playing our games. We\u2019re humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time. There is much more to come from us at Electronic Arts in FY21. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher even than the unprecedented levels we had forecast in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, the Sims and our mobile titles. And, with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected more people to the games they want and to each other.  All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.  I\u2019ll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, and then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business.  Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the three reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.  EA\u2019s net revenue was $1.46 billion, compared to $1.21 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million, compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million, compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and were well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the top line beat.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last twelve months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.  Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.  Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year.  Live services & other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we\u2019ve invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio.  FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented players its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users, life to date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year-on-year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which had its best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more all showed growth of a similar magnitude.  Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for full-game digital download both almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog. A brief note on financial reporting before going on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided by our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we\u2019re increasing the period of time over which we recognize a portion of our net revenue. This begins in second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.  Now, turning to guidance : due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year.  In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy and by the slightly later sports launches. There are reasons for optimism - for example, we\u2019ve added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. FIFA alone attracted 7 million new on console during the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now than at this time than in any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people that have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven\u2019t launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it\u2019s too early to draw general conclusions.  Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economy will prove to be too cautious.  Thus, our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion.  A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We\u2019re continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we are increasing the number of mobile titles in development.  We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year.  For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter.  We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL in Q2 which we've previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3. With regards to live services, remember also that we focus on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing we provide in our quarterly presentation on our IR website. You\u2019ll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.  As we approach six months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We\u2019re excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA teams through the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for the business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increasing reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. These past few months have been unlike anything we\u2019ve ever experienced. It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts. Our business is strong. We\u2019ve just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking and fun esports content, Star Wars : Squadrons launching in October, and more. We\u2019ll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games \u2013 including the next-gen consoles coming later this year.  It\u2019s also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last three months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important.  We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy, everyone. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. MarioLu: Great. Thanks for taking the question. One on FIFA and then one at Star Wars. So the first one on FIFA with it releasing now in fiscal 3Q, although it was previously announced this shift does drive fiscal 2Q guidance to come in below the street. So can you help quantify how much of the shift this caused in terms of bookings? Any other dynamics to keep in mind going forward and should we expect FIFA-22 to now be back in the normal fiscal two release quarter? BlakeJorgensen: Yes. It's a good question and I appreciate you asking, the entire delta is FIFA nothing else is going on. We've tried to be pretty clear about that. I don't think people have necessarily heard that but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning on, we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the two quarters. The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event ultimate teams all event driven that means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year, as well as this year. We made a simple decision which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple extra weeks to final in what is been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is the hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter. They're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million and I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company. We have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious. We also mentioned today that we know there is and if anyone out there thinks there's not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call the other thing which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff; it will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us that might be six months, nine months or two years and what we also mentioned which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of the social network around the game, they tend not to leave and so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just the problem for us is we've never lived through this before and none of us have you guys haven't either. So we don't have a roadmap to be able to help us be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be -- we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward and we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business. So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try to make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and Madden and FIFA ultimate team that are moving but other than that we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision and we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door and we're confident that that's where it's going to be.  Now your second question, sorry I went on too long on the first question. So I forgot your second question. MarioLu: That's great. I haven't asked the second one yet. That's very helpful, Blake. So the second one is on Star Wars. Can you provide some color behind the decision process regarding pricing squadrons at $40 with no additional MTX? So I do think all games are not created equal, so overall I'm surprised how the standard has been for $60 video games in the last years 15. So why go $40 all in and not free to play or just in general what are your thoughts on potentially pricing next gen titles at a higher price point of $70 instead of $60. BlakeJorgensen: Yes and I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important here for both of us. I mean we always look at the top -- the games and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scales and most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly ex wing fighter, fly fighter and be in a dog fight and so it doesn't have the breath of some of our games but it is still an incredible game and so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants versus Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences for example or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an ultimate or a FIFA or Madden. Andrew you want to add to that. AndrewWilson: Yes. I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill. And what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price point. And as you've seen from us we have games across the spectrum of pricing whether that's free to play or at $60 or $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day as we think about it we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations they have and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price point given the breadth of the game, very proud of what we are doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply immersive in that fantasy. As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill? What are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience? And we build from there as we think about this year you've seen what we've done is we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build this the best PlayStation Xbox one experience as we could, as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5ve and what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. ToddJuenger: Thank you so much. And glad to hear everybody is relatively well. Can I ask if you don't mind just thinking through the changes and release dates on the sports titles, I know that was probably a production driven decision but when we're looking at the real live physical sports leagues around the world especially in the states obviously there's a lot of uncertainty about the timing and shape of their seasons this year and next. And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events and the live services and how much it matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped it in halfway through, how does that matter to your games? How should we think about that? I know it's a sort of a broad hypothetical but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens those live sports affect. How we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games. And I have a follow-up. Thanks. BlakeJorgensen: Go ahead Andrew. AndrewWilson: So I would just -- I would start with kind of two things. One is my sense is that we will have sports of some shape or form in the real world over time. The second thing is regardless of whether we do or we don't sports fans have an insatiable appetite for sports day in day out, week in week out, month and month out. And what you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks and what you have seen in Q1 is we've been able to fulfill that insatiable appetite for sports with our games. And there's really -- when we think about our sports games, we think about it on two vectors. One is the connection, the emotional connection, the real world of sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players teams and leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sport stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that and we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to. And then to the extent those sports come back online. We believe that's a further accelerator to our business. BlakeJorgensen: Yes and what I said in the remarks was ultimate team in the quarter was up 70%. I don't think we've ever seen a growth like that and as part of that we know for example Madden ultimate team was up over 300% and there was no sports, live sports going on at any point in time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember their sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays ultimate team alone. They play with each other and that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans, if the underlying sport stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium but at the end of the day it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And sports right I mean you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next six months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, it goes just the opposite which is if you're a Star Wars fan you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars and that's why we saw the growth of Star Wars Jedi fallen order. Growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalogue of Battlefront one and Battlefront two during the quarter. It's when you are Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to this is an incredible opportunity for us, but at the same time we also understand that we don't we can't predict the future and so we're always careful of trying to predict the future. But we do see a huge opportunity. ToddJuenger: Thank you both for that. If you don't mind just one follow-up, somebody's got to ask the M&A question maybe I'll go this quarter and just it seems more ripe than ever given your cash balance and the cash generation and the price the value of your currency. There's at least one big asset we know of that is believed to be in the market, just wondering your disposition toward the thought and the appeal of acquisition. How you are thinking through that decision given where the industry sits right now and anything you share in that thanks? BlakeJorgensen: I mean what I would say there is it is very rare that we don't get a chance to look at anything that's up for sale. I mean you can imagine people call us and say we're thinking about selling a business or we're thinking about selling ourselves. I mean we are a place that a lot of people want to come as a long-term home if they decide to sell the business. So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you as we said you've seen in the past where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people. And we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that we were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titan fall and that's no offense to Titan fall, it's an amazing game and we'll maybe see a Titan fall at some point sometime down the road, but it was really about the team and it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was is that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being sub-scale is difficult, but at the same time as you've seen from our results. I think everybody's going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises is critical to the long-term growth for business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. RyanGee: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So I believe I heard you guys said ultimate team was up 70% year-over-year. I believe that's revenue. Can you remind us what that growth rate looked like going into shelter in place and here we are end of July? How it looks kind of quarter-to- date? And then I have a follow up. BlakeJorgensen: Yes. I mean I don't know off of the top of my head remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits maybe mid double digits like between 15% and 20%. I mean we were having a strong ultimate team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcript you could probably see it. I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean this is -- this is off the charts different right. I mean it is exceptional and particularly for games like -- for games like Madden where normally the soft spot in a game like that where we really come out of the Super Bowl and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement around things like the draft and the combine and you would expect this year maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt ultimate teams. But remember, the team a couple years ago started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year.  So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate team coming into the quarter. And it just continued to get stronger and stronger. I think the other thing is that all the ultimate team stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there were no sports, but as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar as Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down in esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content and I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know because she's a massive sports fan; I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want. So what we've seen so far as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April -May time frame and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices, but it is still well above what we've normally seen particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports season to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year, but remember we know we've got a lot of new people into the game; a lot of people are engaging in ultimate team in the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that'll ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games. And about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 or 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher, to see The Sims up 110% year-over-year. I mean that's driven by a lot of new people elapsed players coming into The Sims and we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last six years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited. So sorry a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're, we, I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent. We are conservative as you guys all know and yet at the same time we are unbelievably optimistic about the business even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world. RyanGee: No. That saves me from asking several questions and then getting a hard time for asking too many. So maybe I'll just finish with one question on FIFA. So the 7 million players that you guys added sequentially coming into FIFA can you shed some light on who these players are? Are they kind of casual fringe players just looking for something to fill time not spending not converting? Or are they the ones that you've seen payer conversion, ARPU in line with your legacy hardcore players that have been in there basically since FY11 playing FIFA ultimate team? Anything you can say about the new players you're reactivated. BlakeJorgensen: Yes. It's hard to say and Andrew you can add to this. It's just early right. So you want to see a pattern over time but Andrew go ahead and jump in. AndrewWilson: Yes. I would say and you heard a little bit of my prepared remarks, but it is early so this 7 million is made up of lots plays, players haven't been with it for a few years and some completely new players. What I would tell you is while it is early and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture. They are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate this connection to friends in connection with the sport and the live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience. And a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players. And we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that our traditionally very highly engaged strong player groups have. So we're at to Blake's point, it's early. It's not easy to predict but the early signs are very strong. And we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term. Operator : The next question -- he's already in queue. Mr. Michael Ng. MichaelNg: Hey. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. The first is I was wondering if you could just expand on your capital allocation plans which you put on pause at least with the buyback last quarter. Do you have plans to authorize a new buyback? And then the second question is could you talk a little bit about how the 7 million additional players that you added sequentially on FIFA informs your expectation for FIFA -21unit sales this year? Is it clear that should be up year-over-year from a unit's perspective because of the enlarged player base? Thank you. BlakeJorgensen: Yes. I mean we're always assuming that if we bring new players in we can most likely increase the player base. And the future purchases. I would say right now as you can see we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA two weeks and that's as a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just still too -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA Madden hockey, are all hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those. On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time it was -- we didn't pause it. I'm sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program and we felt like it was not the right time to send a message both externally, as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program. And so we got through this pandemic and had a little better feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there's commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There are only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12- months. We know that we should be returning some of that locked on a large portion of the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly what's going to happen. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, guys. It's Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So can you talk a little bit about the difference in behavior, if any that you're seeing between your users in the US and Europe? I know we spent a lot of time in the Q&A talking about potential phasing and how it's kind of obviously really hard to tell the sort of retention and behavior you're going to see on players at this stage. But to some extent some many European countries are a little bit ahead of North America in terms of where they are in reopening post COVID. So are you seeing a marked difference in the behavior of those users? Are they dropping off more? And one of your competitors talked last week about seeing weakness in Europe relative to the US. And is that something that is consistent with what you're seeing. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. BlakeJorgensen: Yes. What I would say is one just -- I'll let Andrew jump in here but trends are, if you see a trend for a week you should be really careful because it may not be a trend for three or four weeks. And the European economies are all going through very different swings. Spain's obviously going through another jump in COVID cases and so you want to be really careful. Also every game is different, so the trends in FIFA aren't going to necessarily match the trends in whoever the competitor was that they said was slowing or versus any other game. So I'll let Andrew jump in. He was going to say something it sounds like. AndrewWilson: No. I would just say I would echo Blake's comment. I would also point to the performance of FIFA through our last quarter. And we saw tremendous engagement through the quarter. And I think Blake spoke to kind of a peak and that we -- we've seen some change in that, but the engagement through FIFA and our other games has been very, very strong throughout the entire quarter and continues even now to be much, much stronger than it would be typically at this time of the year. And so to Blake's point, I think, it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that that's because we are providing particularly the relations to FIFA in Europe that emotional connection to football that was missing and what we saw is football came back online at least somewhat in Europe is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that our FIFA game was able to provide. So too early to tell but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they've -- as some of those markets have gone back online. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you and then just on the topic of working from home, obviously, we're much farther in now to the process of everyone getting up the curve of learning how to operate in this environment. Have you learned anything new? Are there any changes the way that you guys are thinking about having your workforce working from home any new challenges? I know there were some public comments from some people that respond that maybe there were some challenges that they hadn't anticipated with Apex. Just any thoughts you have there. Thank you. AndrewWilson: Yes. I would -- again, we're all, I mean, everybody on this call is working from home and there are many great benefits to working from home as it turns out. We've cut down our commute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families and in some cases, I think, we are significantly more productive in a work from home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging, the mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in one place. I think as an organization we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible. And often offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there are a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce was work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that comes from putting creative people together in a building at least for some part of the time. And again, we are -- we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely, in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers is that we'll be most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year at which point we'll reevaluate. And we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees and to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make. We're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much to share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some. But those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home forever. BlakeJorgensen: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that is I just -- I remind people to go back and on net bookings our live services with $1.103 billion, up $416 million from prior year. Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services and live services are require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization that is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean Andrew and I every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because then once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run lives, how do you run ultimate team or Apex from home. No one's ever done it and it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over indexing on us moving FIFA out of second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think what we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for via the COVID virus but we've proven that this is something that's really special. So with that I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person maybe someday soon or maybe a year from now who knows. But we appreciate everybody's interest and time. And I know it's a busy day of earnings. So it's tough for teams. But thank you guys for your good questions as always and listening. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. Be well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q2 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Jason. Welcome to EA's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. With me from their homes today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that, our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we've posted adding slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks and audio replay of this call our financial model and a transcript. Now that, we completely revamped the earnings slides this quarter, they now contain all of the metrics and color that we historically have included in Blake's remarks. These changes free up time on the call for more analysis from Blake and Andrew and provide more opportunity for questions from you. Please let me have your feedback on this change. With regards to our calendar, our Q3 fiscal 2021 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, February 2. As a reminder, we post our entire year of earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and comments, as our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today November 5, 2020 and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics with the exception of free cash flow will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. I hope this find everyone well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. After the biggest first quarter in the history of Electronic Arts, our second quarter of FY 2021 showed continued strength with net revenue and earnings above our guidance. We are driving growth through the breadth, depth and quality of our new games, our industry-leading live services and expansion to more platforms and more ways to play. Let me first say, how thankful I am to our teams for their incredible work and everything they are delivering for our players. The well-being of our people remains our top priority. Even amidst these unprecedented circumstances, we are executing and building great strength across our business. Here are a few key examples. We delivered eight new games so far this year, and our network has grown to more than 330 million unique accounts as tens of millions of new players have joined to enjoy more of our amazing games and content. EA SPORTS continues to be a leader in sports interactive entertainment. Madden NFL 20 was the most successful game in franchise history last year and now Madden NFL 21 already has nearly 30% more players year-over-year from launch. Our FIFA franchise is engaging more than 100 million players globally. Even prior to launching FIFA 21 our FIFA franchise is having the biggest calendar year ever with our business across all platforms up 26% year-over-year in net bookings. FIFA 20 has reached nearly 35 million players on console and PC. FIFA Mobile continues to perform well and FIFA Online Asia broke engagement records across China and Korea in Q2. We just launched FIFA Mobile in Japan in October, as we continue to see significant international expansion opportunities for our FIFA franchise. We continue to have an outstanding relationship with Disney and Lucasfilms. Star Wars : Squadrons launched a great feedback from critics and the community and has performed above our expectations. This is clearly a special game for fans and continues the extraordinary success we've had bringing great games to life with this IP, including Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, Star Wars : The Old Republic and the Star Wars Battlefront franchise. Our live services are among the most successful in the industry and our live services net bookings have grown more than 28% fiscal year-over-year to date. EA SPORTS ultimate team has more than 30 million players so far this year, up 25% year-over-year. Around the world our multi-platform Sims community continues to grow and our Sims four player base on PC and console is now the largest in franchise history. Apex Legends has established itself as a top global franchise with major year-over-year growth and continued expansion opportunities. Apex in Asia is having great success with each season of content. We've just launched a game to massive Steam community and cross play is now live making it easier for people to play with friends around the world. Our esports programs are scaling the new records in viewership also. Our new Madden NFL episodic content featuring NFL athletes, celebrities and top Madden NFL players is bringing great entertainment to a much wider audience. And our recent FIFA 21 challenge, which paired esports stars with celebrity soccer players was our most watch esports event to date with viewership that place it amongst top esports broadcast worldwide. Our EA PLAY service is the most successful multi-platform subscription in the industry. With the addition of our subscription on PS4 and Steam, we've reached more than 6.5 million paid subscribers. EA PLAY is now set to go live on Microsoft Game Pass in a few days, and we believe we have the opportunity to double our subscriber base over the next 12 months. In addition to our subscription, we launched more than 125 games and content packs on Steam this year with new tiles like C&C Remastered and Star Wars : Squadrons leading the download chat on the platform. Bringing our games to Steam is a new and additive business for us. With the EA and Steam communities able to play together, we're able to harness the full opportunity in the PC space as it continues to show strong growth. We continue to lead the industry as the only developer and publisher with the ability to bring this much quality content to players. We've done this through unprecedented circumstances in the last six months and now we're delivering more great experiences in our current quarter. We started our third quarter by launching two new EA SPORTS games. When it went live globally on October 9 FIFA 21 already had a record number of players in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong and FIFA Ultimate Team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. NHL 21, which includes the fan favorite NHL 94 Rewind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current gen consoles. The Sims four and Apex Legends show how we build great live services into strong ongoing businesses. This quarter we'll launch our tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4 along with an important game update to add even more cultural customization options for our players. On the heels of our highly successful Season 6 we've just launched Season 7 in Apex Legends which is said to be our biggest season of content this year. We now have more than 20 top live services across console, PC and mobile forming a foundation for continued growth. We will continue to reach more players across more platforms in Q3. We have more titles launching on Switch and Google Stadia this quarter. Medal of Honor : Above and Beyond will launch on Oculus VR in December our second VR experience this year. And as I mentioned before, we will take another step in our subscription strategy this week with our expansion to Microsoft Game Pass opening significant new opportunities to grow our subscriber base. This quarter also brings the launch of next-generation consoles from our partners at Microsoft and Sony. EA SPORTS is always at the center of innovation for us and it will lead the way on next-gen consoles. FIFA 21 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will leverage the major upgrading technology to bring players unprecedented immersion, innovative gameplay and minimal load times to put them into the action in under two seconds. Madden NFL 21 for the next-gen consoles will blur the lines of sport even further through a new system that is responsive to the way NFL players perform in the real world. We're excited to have an opportunity to bring even more players into our FIFA and Madden franchises this year and we're providing a smooth transition for players on current gen consoles to move over with the next-gen upgrade. Looking ahead, I want to offer a few thoughts on our growth drivers for FY 2022 and beyond. Each previous console generation has grown in the global market and we expect this transition will be the same. We plan to launch at least six new games on the next-gen consoles in FY 2022. These will include a new Need for Speed game that is bringing some astounding visual leaps developed by the Criterion team who have launched some of the most highly rated games in franchise history. DICE is creating our next Battlefield game with never before seen scale. The technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise. We have hands on play testing underway internally and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we've begun to engage our community. The next Battlefield is set to launch in holiday 2021, we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring. Our live services are positioned to be a long-term growth driver. Having built Apex Legends into an amazing live service with a deeply engaged community, the talented Respawn team in Los Angeles has expanded Apex development to include a full team in our Vancouver location so that we can continue delivering more great content. Japan is now our second largest market for Apex Legends and we have strong plans to continue growth in that region. In addition, Apex mobile development will be complete in the New Year and ready for launch in FY 2022. We also expect another very strong year for the Sims 4 a testament to the strength of that community as it enters the seventh year of live service. EA SPORTS will be executing on a significant expansion that will span new games more geographies and more ways to engage. FIFA is growing. In addition to FIFA 21 on next-gen this year and Stadia in the new year, the success of our FIFA Online four free-to-play game in Asia now leads us to expand that game to new markets including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Soccer continues to grow on popularity around the world and we now have six new soccer mobile games in development for new genres and new markets. Our roster of top soccer league licenses is also unmatched. Our recently extended agreements with the Bundesliga and La Liga in addition to more than 30 other league partners including UEFA Champions League, [11:22] [Indiscernible] and the Premier League enable us to continue delivering this franchise to more players around the world with the authenticity they expect. We also just announced a new multiyear -- we also just announced new multiyear agreements with our partners at the NHL, NHLPA and UFC that is creating more innovative hockey and fighting experiences. We also have plans to add our core EA SPORTS portfolio with multiple new franchises in the years ahead. In addition to our college esports expansion that we've just announced with ING Group, in the weeks ahead we'll share more about another major new development in our esports program capitalizing on our growing fan base and demand from esports teams, sponsors and broadcasters. Our business has expanded significantly this year. Our pipeline of new games and live services is robust and we're positioned well for sustained growth. A huge thank you goes to our amazing teams for their incredible spirit and dedication to our players. I am proud of how we have continued to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew and I will echo what you said earlier which is we hope all of you on the phone are healthy, your families are healthy and you're dealing with this amazing challenge. We continue to be unbelievably impressed by how our teams have actually delivered. And Andrew talked about that and it is just a testament to the strength of Electronic Arts. As you know from Chris' introduction, we're trying something a little different with our earnings call this quarter. And you should listen to my prepared remarks in conjunction with the expanded presentation we've posted on our Investor Relations website earlier today. It contains the metrics and the color I would normally read and bore you with. But hopefully, it gives you a lot more information than maybe you might hear through the call. This approach gives us more time for analysis and more time for your questions. So with that I'd like to briefly highlight a few points. We came in well above our guidance for the quarter. The beat was driven by our live services led by Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA Ultimate Team. First week sell-through for Madden was up nearly 20% year-on-year and this after Madden NFL 20 turning the best year ever for Madden on console. This is also the first time we linked Madden Mobile to console Madden and we saw hundreds of thousands of mobile players registered in the first tranche of Madden NFL 21 buyers. Credit is also due to the Respawn teams and the quality of the content that they have been adding to Apex Legends. Apex Legends net booking came in 24% above what we had last year and is off to an incredibly strong start in Q3. We started the year expecting Apex Legends to deliver $300 million to $400 million in net bookings is now on track to deliver more than $500 million. That is Apex will have gone from $0 billion to about $1 billion in lifetime net bookings in just two years. With this velocity and the addition of mobile we believe Apex has the potential to grow to $1 billion in net bookings every year. This is what we do. We've done it with FIFA. We've done it with Madden. We've done it with the Sims and we're doing it again with Apex due to the amazing teams that we have really driving this business. Mobile grew year-on-year again and we're excited about a new title slate for this platform particularly the Apex Legends and soccer games that Andrew discussed. It's been a strong three months for launching new EA games. We launched Madden NFL 21 Star Wars : Squadrons UFC 4 in the quarter along with Rocket Arena from Final Strike Games. Squadrons is the latest example of the power of our licensing model in which we leverage the synergy between well-loved IP and the skills of our development teams to bring extraordinary new experiences to fans and gamers. The FIFA franchise continues to grow. FIFA 20 attracted 12% more players than FIFA 2019 and engagement remains strong making FIFA 20 the most successful FIFA game in the 27-year history of the franchise. FIFA 21 launched after quarter end and is off to a great start with live services net bookings for the first three weeks up relative to the comparable period last year. FIFA Ultimate Team contributes to be the most popular mode in the game and also the most engaging for players. After eight weeks of Madden NFL 21, digital accounted for 66% of units sold through the players. After the first three weeks of FIFA 21 number was 50%. These are both up 14 points year-over-year and we believe this step-up is likely a permanent structural change driven by the COVID shelter-in-place orders. This adds up to six new games launched since the beginning of Q2 including blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Madden and fan favorites like Star Wars : Squadrons. This is more than our peers manage in a year, the further testimony to our team's ability to execute under difficult circumstances. We've reached more players with the EA PLAY this quarter with the launch of the subscription service on Steam. In addition, Microsoft has noted the value of EA PLAY will bring to their game pass ultimate and we expect making it available on that platform will lead to another step-up in EA PLAY subscribers. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations driven primarily by variable compensation and phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month cash flow of $2.04 billion. The strength and dependability of our cash flow has led us to start a new repurchase program this quarter and to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history. The share repurchase authorization is for a $2.6 billion program over two years. Our Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, which represents an annualized yield of about 0.5% calculated as of the close of the market on November 4. As a result, we expect to return a total of $3 billion to investors over the next 24 months. We're now looking ahead to the launches of the new Playstation and Xbox. Console transitions have historically driven broad industry growth and our opportunities to grow our franchises. In particular, owners of NFL 21 and FIFA 21 for the current generation of consoles can upgrade for free to the next-generation versions any time before the launch of the 22nd or 22 versions of game next year. In addition, we expect to leverage the ongoing strength of FIFA 20 engagement and building an even larger audience for FIFA 21. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remain $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.485 billion, and earnings per share of $3.15. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. See our earnings slides and further cash flow information for more details. Remember that, our guidance EPS calculation do not factor in any share repurchases. We expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. This is driven by ongoing strength in our live services offset by the move of Apex Legends on Switch, and the extra time, we're giving to our EA originals titles. Versus our expectations last quarter, those changes amount to about $120 million of net bookings moved out of the fiscal 2021 year that will benefit fiscal 2022. The annual guidance factors in an FX headwind of about $80 million. And as you build your models note, that we are forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year, due to the sustained low interest rates the world is experiencing. For the third quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $599 million and operating expenses of $840 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the third quarter to be $2.35 billion, which would make it the largest quarter in EA history. Some context for this guidance, we are now guiding fiscal 2021 net bookings to be 11% higher than fiscal 2020. This is incredible growth some driven by the shelter-in-place orders, but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services content and games to players. Even with a strong year, we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year. The growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles, including Battlefield, our blockbuster sports titles Need For Speed and the titles we moved out of fiscal 2021 to 2022. We anticipate a strong performance from our live services and we continue to bring our franchises to new platforms, for example, bringing Apex Legends to mobile. With that, I will now turn it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. Games are becoming essential trait of the digital lifestyle for people around the world. With more players than ever continuing to connect and engage through our franchises, our business has grown significantly this year, and we are confident of projecting meaningful growth into FY 2022 and beyond. We hope everybody stays healthy and enjoy some great games this holiday season. And now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Alexia Quadrani : Thank you so much. I'm curious to what trends you might be seeing in Europe and the U.S. now that we see kind of resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Do you think that the second wave potentially could be a bit different than what you saw kind of earlier this year? In the sense, people may have more pandemic fatigue and maybe less of a tailwind for sort of engaging in video gaming? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. Let me jump in first. I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I think the thing to note is unlike say March, when virtually the whole world shutdown at the same time, we're seeing stages of changes in different communities around the world. And so we don't expect that we would see the surge that we saw before. But we also know that, as we get into winter, flu season other things. And I don't want to predict the COVID path, because that's way out of my expertise. But we do know that people will continue to gravitate to online entertainment. And what we also know is that, much of the traditional entertainment i.e. movies, TV have been stalled because of the COVID situation. And so, people will drift towards more and more online entertainment, which we know they're going to engage in, because we've seen that in the past. And we will continue to do things to try to help people understand, why it is a great way to engage with things they love be it sports, be it the Sims be whatever it is. Hard to say and I will tell you we have been very careful, not to try to predict that in our guidance. And thus, the reason that we've provided the guidance, we've provided because it is a world in which we have never been in before. And so trust that, we'll keep investors and the sell-side up-to-date, as we see things, but we want to also be really careful, because of the world that as I said, we just don't have a lot of history in. And we want to be really careful, but we also want to know that, we are one of the most important entertainment vehicles, for people during this difficult time. Alexia Quadrani : Thank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up if I may. Any update on the outlook for China game approvals for Apex? Blake Jorgensen : It is a very hard thing to predict. What we know is with our partners in China, we are very optimistic. But guessing approvals is really difficult. But we're optimistic. We believe that, this is something that we can ultimately get approval on. But more importantly remember the mobile game for Apex outside of China, China doesn't require approval. And so it's more about making sure the game is correct, testing the game and then rolling it out in the key markets. And we're pretty confident on all of those. As we talked about, the Japanese market is one of the largest markets for Apex, second largest in the world. We believe that there's a huge opportunity for mobile in that market. And so, we will continue to focus on, where we think those largest markets are for early rollout. And we'll keep people informed, as we start to test the game. And get it into the market. But I think as Andrew said, in his comments, we believe that's coming in the coming fiscal 2022. And we're excited -- we're very excited about the opportunity there. Alexia Quadrani : Thank you so much. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies. Your line is open. Alex Giaimo : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew curious if you could provide any more color on the EA PLAY partnership, with Microsoft Game Pass, I guess why does the partnership make sense for EA? And why is it appealing? And then Blake if you could just provide any broad commentary around, how the economics of that deal works? That would be helpful. Thank you, guys. Andrew Wilson : In terms of why it makes sense for us, again our objective from the very beginning has been to ensure that players can access our subscription on any platform, in any way that makes sense for them, to the best value gaming opportunity in the marketplace. We have strong partnership with Microsoft and Sony and Steam. And of course we have our own platform with EA PLAY. And as we looked at it we saw this as an opportunity to build, an access point for our EA PLAY subscription on the Microsoft platform. We saw it as a way to give gamers easy and frictionless access. We will -- as part of that this is not just putting our games at Microsoft subscription, this is actually an entitlement to the EA PLAY subscription. And as a result of that the relationship that we have, with those players who make those subscriptions, they will be the same as if we sold it outside the platform. So you'll continue to see us think about our subscription broadly across platforms. And making it available to any player wherever they want, in any way they need, with as little friction as possible. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. What I would say is that, I can't give you details on the exact economics. You can imagine that, Microsoft wanted us to be part of their subscription. We thought it was a great opportunity and there's a positive economic impact on that. When it comes to giving guidance next year, we probably still won't give detail because it's not that big of an overall business. I think to Andrew's point is the real goal is how do we grow our subscription and also help Microsoft grow their subscription. I mean this is a great partnership with them. And we're really looking. We are \u2013 think about it as we're in the very early days of the industry on subscriptions for games and we're doing everything possible to help consumers understand, why it is a great potential for them to either be introduced to new games, play the games they love or play games for a great value. And so more to come on it but you should also trust \u2013 we don't do anything for free. So we \u2013 and Microsoft to figure it out the right way I think the economics work for both of us and that's how we've approached it. Alex Giaimo : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple on Madden. You guys mentioned that Madden NFL 21 has 30% more players year-on-year. I understand that the title has a new mode this year called The Yard. So any color you can provide on how that mode is performing and if it was a driver to either player or engagement growth. And just in the future are there any plans to monetize either The Yard or for FIFA the Volta mode directly? Or do you think it's just best suited as an engagement enhancer? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Great question. Again, when we think about Madden and we think about FIFA for that matter, we really think about as a platform to bring the fans of these sports together to engage in interactive consumption of the sport. And 10, 15 years ago we would have had multiple games, arcade style, simulation style, management style, that we would put in the marketplace as separate packaged goods. As we've really transformed our business into the world of digital as we've moved the experience from product to service for our players, what our players have also told us is they want us to keep them together. They want to come together, regardless of what format they're engaging with. And so as we continue to develop the Madden franchise, as we continue the FIFA franchise, you should expect that we'll continue to add these new modalities of play to the product or to the service. What we've seen so far this year in Madden is there's been really good and strong engagement in The Yard. It's early \u2013 it's still early in its life cycle. But it's offering this opportunity for people to come into the franchise in a new way and play a more casual experience. If they haven't really wanted to engage in the full 11 V11 experience that he is going to buy. But it also allows our harder core players to do something a little different, a little more social and a little faster paced than the traditional Madden game. And so overall we feel like it adds a substantial element to the overall player experience both for new players and returning players. And the same has been true for Volta inside of FIFA. In the context of cosmetic sale items we'll start to experiment with that. What we've seen across the industry is when done right the purchase of cosmetics that allow you to individualize and personalize your experience and build status in that environment as you play with your friends have been really, really well received. We expect that will be no different in Madden and FIFA over time and we'll start to work with our gaming communities as to what are the right things to them? What kind of cosmetics they look like? What are most authentic and relatable to the sports that they're playing in? And what gives them the opportunity to be unique in these large growing communities? Mario Lu : Okay. Thank you. Chris Evenden : Sorry, Jason I don't think we have any more questions in the queue, right? Operator : My apologies, we are going to do one last\u2026 Chris Evenden : We still got one, okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a couple more questions. Your next question is from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I think this was almost back in July. I think you guys hired a new head of Mobile games, I think Jeff Karp, I believe. So I'm just wondering what you think he's going to do, that's different versus the prior management of that segment. Because I think we've been kind of waiting for some of your larger franchises to become hits on Mobile as well. So what you think the road map is going to be for the future for these entertainment properties to reach an audience that's hopefully multiples of what you have now? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Great question. And we're really happy and excited to welcome Jeff back to the organization. He has been an EA veteran and held very senior leadership roles in the company some number of years ago, but spent the best part of the last decade in kind of mobile-first organizations and comes back to us with unbelievable experience and tremendous expertise. And we are now -- you heard me talk about six new FIFA titles. You hear us talk about the push with Apex Legends. What I would tell you is, Jeff has come back and made three core assessments. The first is that we have an existing portfolio of games that are tremendously profitable, but have significant more opportunity for engagement and monetization than we're presently doing with some changes to the organization and some changes to how we run those live services. And he's already started to work with leaders and we brought a number of new leaders from across the mobile industry into our company and they are going through each one of our franchises and looking for opportunities to deliver new content, new experiences and new services to players that will drive higher engagement and result in monetization in our existing franchises. The second thing he has done has come in and said, there are a number of key franchises like FIFA who have unbelievable exponential opportunity around the world. And he's put in motion a series of internal development and external development that will really start to execute against our big franchises like FIFA and some others that we will be able to talk about more soon. And then the third thing is, he also has a tremendous network out there in the mobile sphere. And there are a lot of great developers out there who have really great games and really great game mechanics and lot of experience and expertise, but they do not have the IP to build their games around or the marketing muscle to really drive acquisition and what is becoming an increasingly competitive market. And so Jeff is also doing a lot of outreach with external developers and publishers and looking at ways that we could partner differently with them with our slate of IP and with our marketing muscle. Either in the context of licensing or co-development or co-publishing or in some cases acquisition. And so I've not been more excited for a number of years about what I think we're going to be able to achieve in our mobile business. And again, what we know is mobile is tremendously competitive. It's somewhat unpredictable. There are a lot of games that come to app stores on an annualized basis. But we are seeing that where you build games with great teams around trusted IP that offer unbelievable experience and value to players that monetization opportunity is very, very strong. And we're confident about that going into FY 2022 with FIFA and Apex Legends and Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and others. But certainly as we look out further into 2023 and 2024, we feel like we're well positioned there as well. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Berg from Berenberg. Your line is open. Robert Berg : Hi. Yes. Thanks for question. I'm just on next-generation interestedly here, you're thinking behind the free next year upgrades that you're offering for FIFA, for example versus the higher price that some of your peers charging to their games, and how you set it on your current strategy? And then a quick follow-up with whether you think that even with the free upgrade path the next-gen consoles is delaying the purchasing decisions of any of your players even in a few weeks or months? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would say, I mean, we've always known and we've seen over history that people will delay purchases without gap. I mean, it's just -- it's natural in a console transition. But I would also remember that there will only be a small amount and this is not a negative on Sony or Microsoft business is just a reality of how many consoles they can produce. Dave I think both publicly talked about eight million, 10 million, 11 million, 12 million consoles in the market between now and the end of March, because that -- it's just reality right? So we know that some people will wait, but also some people will upgrade over time. And the reason we did the upgrade program is, we wanted to make sure people felt that they would be comfortable buying the Gen 4 version and the notion that they would be able to upgrade without any problems. And it's all about the consumer experience, it's about making sure you're staying connected to your social network that plays the same game that you're playing. And we didn't want anyone to feel like for some reason because they didn't want to -- or they wanted to wait for a new console that they didn't fall out of the key component of what is so important in our games, which is the ability to play with your friends. And it's not much more complicated than that. We do think if we look back on past console transitions, we know that it will take time to build the inventory and the level of new consoles. But we also know based on what we've seen in the new consoles, it will add incredible opportunities for us to build better and better games over time because of more power, and that's what we're really excited about. And as we've talked about we will build a series of games this year and continue to add to that no different than we've done in past console cycles. And I think the rest of the industry is that way. And that's how people approach it, but it is where it gets really, really exciting a year or two years from now, because I will tell you games are going to be unbelievable when you start to see them a year or two years from now in the new consoles. Robert Berg : And a quick follow-up if I can. The games are going to be hopefully as I believe what you said, do you think that warrants a higher price point in the future? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. I mean, I don't really want to weigh in on that yet. We've always said that games are getting more expensive. The experience is getting deeper. The time that people are playing games is getting longer. One might argue that that might require a higher price point over time. But we'll address that as we get closer to more games coming into the next-gen console transition. And what I default back to is let's stay focused on the excitement of what we can do with the new games and price will follow that. We'll figure that out. And I don't want people to read into that. We're going to raise prices or not. We don't know yet. What we do know is we're going to be able to do a lot more things with the new consoles and our partnerships with the new console Sony and Microsoft and others that are making the consoles. Robert Berg : Perfect. Thanks so much. Chris Evenden : Jason, could you give us the next question please? Operator : My apologies, I was muted. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hey, thanks for letting me take the question. I have a couple of questions. The first one is could you give us a little history lesson on the impact that new consoles have on sports titles? It seems that the new powerful consoles could do a lot pretty quickly for ball physics and bodies and crowds and audiences. So do you normally see a pickup within the sports franchises in the first couple of years of a console cycle? Blake Jorgensen : Yeah, I'll let Andrew answer that because he's lived this a lot more than I have. Andrew Wilson : The short answer is yes. I've been doing this for a long time now. And most of my career before I was fortunate enough to have this job I was building sports video games. And so I went through a number of consoles. And I would tell you not only do we see the market grow considerably. If you go back and look through history every console transition meaningfully grows the market and top-tier frontline sports games almost always drive a lot of that growth and benefit from the growth in player engagement as those console transitions move through and a bigger market buys into the new console generation. We think about game development in terms of kind of what can you do with a core technology level what can you do at a future level? And what can you do at a social level and as we've gone through generations, the intelligence and the believability of plays in a sports game it's had a step change in immersion and authenticity and realism each console generation. If you go back you want the history lesson PS2 was all about can you make athletes look like the real-world athlete? PS3 or the next-generation was all about can you make the moves like real athletes. The generation that we're now is can you make them remote like real athletes? And as we look at the next-generation of platforms, it's can you bring all of those together and add a level of intelligence to those players that upholds the suspense and this belief that you are in fact engaging with real athletes in a real game on a real pitch. And so I expect that we will continue to do and drive unbelievable new development in the context of the base technology that drives the game play. The second thing that you'll also see as we move through transition is modality shift how people play single player to multiplayer, multiplier to cooperative play. And you'll see us continue to do that with the power of these new platforms and how we can bring players together in new modalities of play. And you're starting to see some of those things with how we started with Volta how we've started with The Yard and you should expect that we'll continue to expand the modalities of play on new platforms. And then last and this happened as we move from offline to online. It's really the social nature of the game and how you tie the game to the real-world of sport. And you heard me talk about how we're building Madden so that there is a greater influence of what's happening in the real-world of sport on your game. But you should also imagine that we'll start to think about how do we use the technology in these new platforms, how do we use them plus the combination of the cloud to bring millions and millions of players together in a social ecosystem around the consumption of their favorite sport. And we're excited by that as much as the base technology quite frankly, because these are becoming social networks for sports fans and COVID has accelerated that for us as the consumption of sport more broadly has moved from lean to interactive and physical interaction has moved -- social interactions move from physical to digital. So as we think about the combination of the base technology that influence gameplay the different modalities of play that the new platforms will enable and the new platforms combined with the cloud to offer an expansion of the social network orientation of these games, we're really excited about the future. And you tie that into what will almost certainly be a growing marketplace. We think we have tremendous opportunity not just this year, but in many years to come. Andrew Uerkwitz : Awesome. I appreciate the enthusiasm for the game technology. It's great color. And if I can just sneak one more in? Blake, last quarter you mentioned you remain very interested in M&A and want to be active there. How should investors square that thought with the buyback and the new dividend. Can you give us your latest thoughts on M&A? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would not connect the dots between the buyback or dividend with M&A. I mean we -- I think you all know we're on a consistent path of buyback and we paused it at the end of the last part of the buyback program when we finished it at the end of March because we were going into COVID and I think we were pretty transparent with people that it wasn't just a street issue. It was also a concern around how our employees thought about, how we are spending our money. And we feel more confident of that today. And in fact, I would say we feel more confident because we've added the dividend. Now the reality is, if we're talking about the buyback level and the dividend level we're still either under or coming close to our annual cash flow. And we have substantial cash on the balance sheet and substantial debt capacity. So don't read into that as the inability or lack of desire to do any acquisitions. We are incredibly focused on what could we buy, but at the same time, we're also focused on making sure we don't destroy shareholder value in buying and doing an acquisition. And I don't want to comment on any individual acquisitions, but it's a balance of driving growth but at the same time, being responsible with your guy's capital because that's with investors' capital because that's what really matters to us. What I would say though is, the one thing to read into the buyback and the dividend is an incredible confidence in the business. And that's not short-term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter. And if many of you have been around a long time, we've almost rarely ever increased guidance coming out of the first quarter. And granted we had the COVID situation that created one of the greatest first quarters, unfortunately because of the situation that was going on around the world. But what we are continuing to do is feel very, very confident about our business. I don't want anyone to read the fact that we may not be raising guidance now as a negative because we need to all remember we've raised guidance $500 million during the year. We thought we were going to do $5.55 billion and we're talking about close to $6 billion and what you heard from Andrew and I today as we're planning on growth again next year. That's the most important message. What I will also tell you is, if anyone can predict right now what's going to happen in the economy over the next three months or six months call me and tell me. Because it is going to be very difficult and we are very careful in how we present and focus our guidance in our business, but we are very confident in the strength of our business right now. And we are seeing things as we mentioned. A simple example Apex Japan and we don't know when it will happen. But if it happens, it will be big. There is so many different things inside our business that are so strong that we are very, very excited about where it can go. So I just -- I don't want anyone to get ahead of themselves on guidance, but I don't want anyone to think that the message we're sending out is in any way negative that we haven't raised guidance because remember we raised guidance by $500 million and we've told people we're going to grow again next year. So keep it in that context that's where it gets exciting. That's where the opportunity is. I know that's not the question you asked, but don't read anything into things like share repurchase or dividend as a negative. They're all positive. It's a commitment and a confidence in the business that I think we're -- that's where Andrew and I are and why it's so exciting in our industry is so exciting going forward. So sorry to a little too much more than everyone wanted to hear, but I just -- I think both Andrew and I are really passionate about where we think this is going. And we want to make sure people don't get over indexed on the short-term and they actually read what we're telling people as the real opportunity. Andrew Uerkwitz : No I think that's -- I think that's great color. I appreciate that. I think that's a lot of the questions I've been getting so far tonight. Had a mixed feeling, but I can't even predict what I'm having for dinner tonight. So great quarter and we'll talk to you next month. Blake Jorgensen : Thank you. Chris any more questions in the queue? Operator : There certainly is. Your final question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies. Your line is open Alex Giaimo : Thanks, guys. Thanks for let me hop back on. We've seen a lot of game delays in the space recently and even on the AAA side. So, just curious as you think towards next year in Battlefield obviously that's a big theme for fiscal 2022. So just curious if you can provide an update about how you're feeling about the development process? And if there's any risk a year from now that maybe that game doesn't launch on time? It would be helpful to get an update there. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. Again, if you look at our prepared remarks and the conversation we've had today, we've launched eight games and over 200 live services and season seven of Apex Legends during this time. Working from home is -- there's no doubt it's extraordinarily hard and we're doing all we can to support our teams in any way we can. There are some benefits that come from having our scale and having our organizational structure that allows us greater fluidity of our talent. We're able to move talent from project-to-project. We're able to kind of leverage our scale in the development process. And you've seen that play out this year in our ability to launch as much high-quality content as we have.  And even as of 11 :00 a.m. this morning, season seven of Apex Legends is on track to be our largest launch day since the launch of the product. Steam in the first rolled out performance has been extremely strong. Our new champion edition is already a top three bestseller on Steam. We've had the most minutes watched on Twitch since the launch of the product. So another testament to just the unbelievable, inspirational capabilities of our teams and our ability to continue to deliver amazing games experiences and content in the face of these ongoing challenges.  As we think about Battlefield next year again you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing. We're starting to go out to our community and get feedback. I was part of the product review last week. We have rallied that entire studio around the development of Battlefield specifically. We've given them an extra year of development.  You'll remember to ensure that they can in fact build a true next-gen vision around that game. DICE is one of the most talented studios on the planet and we've been able to add leadership from our EA SPORTS business and David Rutter who understands both live services and the rigor of development. We've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence in our ability to launch that game next year. So lots more to come in the next couple of months.  But even in the face of challenges I think we've demonstrated an ability to launch amazing games and content. I feel really, really good about the content we're coming next year. And part of why we have the confidence in FY 2022 that we have to grow off this year which is going to be an unbelievably extraordinary record year for us is because our scale and our organizational structure and our amazing talent, our amazing people are really coming together to deliver amazing content next year. Alex Giaimo : Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : So with that I'll turn it back to Andrew just to a couple of closing remarks. I do thank everybody for spending the time and the commitment on following us. And obviously you know you can always connect with Chris, Aaron, myself and others on any questions, but I'll turn it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And thank you everyone for joining us and we do hope you stay safe and healthy in what appears to be a second surge of COVID in parts of the world. What I think you've earn from me today is extremely confidence in where we're at right now and where we're going for our business. We've had strength and growth in our business this year already forecasting 11% growth year-over-year for FY 2021.  We've launched great new games in content FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims all continue to be major growth drivers and we've got further expansion opportunities this year and beyond. We are excited for the upcoming console launches. New hardware has historically always grown the market and offers us another opportunity to grow FIFA and Madden franchises with our next-gen games and we're projecting continued growth in fiscal year FY 2022 and beyond with an expansion of our sports portfolio a double down in mobile extension of our live services and of course, a new Battlefield game.  So thank you for being here today. Thanks for your questions. Be well. Thank you so much. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for joining today. You may now disconnect.",

I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We\u2019ve delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter and we are raising guidance today for the remainder of FY \u201821. After starting this fiscal year with guidance for $5.55 billion in net bookings, we\u2019re now expecting to achieve nearly $6.1 billion in net bookings for the full year. And we are projecting growth in our business to continue next fiscal year. We\u2019re delivering exceptional high-quality experiences across the unmatched breadth and depth of our portfolio. We are driving growth through our live services and we are reaching new players by bringing our content and subscription to more platforms. Drilling down on these growth drivers. EA SPORTS is at the core of the sports experience for hundreds of millions of fans. More and more people, especially younger Gen Z players, are now defining their sports fandom through the games they play like FIFA, Madden, NHL and UFC. In the past fiscal year, we\u2019ve had more than 230 million people engaged with our EA SPORTS franchises and content. We delivered six new high-quality sports games in FY \u201821, including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21, on the new Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, ushering in a new generation of sports games. FIFA continues to grow on every platform. We set a new record of nearly six million daily active players in FIFA Ultimate Team in December and FUT matches have grown a staggering 177% year-over-year. FIFA Online 4 in Korea has had higher player acquisition in every quarter of this year compared to last year. And we now have nearly 21 million players in FIFA Mobile Asia. We are driving growth across our EA SPORTS portfolio. Madden NFL has more players engaged in the franchise than ever before. NHL engagement is up 13% year-over-year. And since launch, UFC 4 has consistently had 20% more daily players than our previous game. EA SPORTS is at the center of innovation, both in our games as well as how fans are connecting through our games to their friends and to the sports they love. For example, in a year where an in-person Pro Bowl event was not possible, we worked with our NFL partners to create the first-ever virtual Pro Bowl in Madden NFL 21. This was a groundbreaking experience for fans, where playing Madden actually helped to select two Pro Bowl players. The Pro Bowl itself then took place in Madden NFL 21 with Deshaun Watson and Kyler Murray leading teams of NFL stars in highly entertaining broadcast that aired on Twitch, the NFL Network and NFL social channels last Sunday. Now the Super Bowl is just a few days away and we\u2019re preparing new content in and outside non-NFL for the increasing number of players engaging with our franchise around the NFL\u2019s championship game. Events like this year\u2019s Pro Bowl demonstrate how real-world sports experiences are evolving to become interactive and you can expect to see us continue to lead here. Our fans are telling us that they want more of what EA SPORTS can deliver. They\u2019re playing more of our games than ever before. They\u2019re spending more time with our content. And they\u2019re connecting with each other, the players and teams and sports they love through our experiences. We are now set to build on our leadership position with an aggressive expansion planned for EA SPORTS. We have important announcements we are making today and more that we expect to make in the weeks ahead that will lead to more great games and content for fans and significant new growth to our company. We have a major global expansion of our soccer business under way. As the scale of our EA SPORTS FIFA player audience expands, including a growing Gen Z population, we will offer more great content on more platforms with our long-standing partners across all the top leagues and teams in the sport. We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories, including Russia, Poland and Turkey, with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with six new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres. EA SPORTS is the premier partner for football organizations, leagues and teams around the world. And today, we are announcing that EA SPORTS FIFA will continue to be the exclusive home of UEFA Champions League football. As part of our renewed partnership with UEFA, we\u2019ll also be launching new EA SPORTS competitions and we\u2019ll have even more news in this space in the months ahead. We\u2019re bringing new types of experiences to market that will expand the genre. In partnership with KLab, we are developing a groundbreaking new mobile experience inspired by the Japanese market, which we believe will have global appeal. We\u2019re thrilled to announce today that EA SPORTS is returning to college football. So many fans have been asking us to please bring back college football video games. Their passion for this top-selling sports franchise has never wavered. We love college football as well and today, we\u2019re very excited to say, yes, we are coming back. We have started work on an all-new next-gen experience, working closely with our exclusive licensing partners at CLC to include the universities, logos, venues and gameday traditions that fans know and love in college football. We will grow the EA SPORTS portfolio to include experiences in more sports for more fans around the world. In the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019ll make more announcements about our expansion in a different sport, including at least one new experience that will launch next fiscal year. We\u2019re also incredibly excited to build a racing powerhouse with our proposed acquisition of Codemasters. These are amazing teams that we know very well and we are adding significantly to our racing portfolio to drive growth. FORMULA ONE is one of the few truly global sports and is already seeing unprecedented growth in worldwide fandom, including in North America and Asia. We believe the combination of EA SPORTS and Codemasters can take the game franchise to an even greater level. We are awaiting the results of Codemasters shareholder vote on our offer, which we anticipate having tomorrow, February 3. With the strength of our EA SPORTS franchises and these announcements today, we are in a position to deliver the world\u2019s best sports games and content. We intend to leverage our capabilities in this space to grow to more sports and more experiences, reaching larger audiences in more markets all over the world. These announcements today are just the beginning. For 230 million EA SPORTS players and viewers, we are providing a social network that enables them to experience more of the sport they love with their friends. We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in EA SPORTS experiences over the next five years. The future of entertainment is interactive and the future of sports will continue to blur the lines between live sports and immersive and engaging new experiences. EA SPORTS is at the center of this convergence. And in collaboration with our amazing league partners, we are prepared to accelerate the future of sports entertainment. In addition to EA SPORTS, we are driving growth through our portfolio of more than 20 top live services. I\u2019ll give two examples from our deep roster of wholly owned IP. We are at the two-year anniversary of the launch of Apex Legends. And with 30% growth in new players year-over-year, its success is accelerating. The unique seasons of live service content delivered by our talented Respawn team are expanding the Apex audience, bringing in more players with great storytelling and engaging in-game events. Competitive play in Apex Legends is also reaching and entertaining more viewers with recent events in November driving new viewership and watch time records. This is an outstanding live service business that continues to grow across multiple dimensions. Launching the game on Steam is bringing new PC players. We will launch on the Nintendo Switch on March 9 and we\u2019ll expand further with our Apex mobile game rolling out in FY \u201822. The Sims 4 has grown every year since launch. As we expand the experience, more new and relevant content, we engage a diverse and growing audience spanning players of all ages and demographics. Life to date, more than 33 million people have now played The Sims 4. And daily, weekly and monthly average players in the game all reached all-time highs for the third quarter in December. Our Maxis just delivered a tenth expansion pack for The Sims 4 and we see continued growth for our Sims business in FY \u201822. We have the ability to bring games to every platform and we are driving continuing expansion of our total addressable market. Mobile continues to be a key opportunity for us. Games like Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes continue to be deeply engaging for players and very successful businesses and we have plans to aggressively grow our mobile portfolio. We\u2019re also expanding our lead in subscriptions. The groundbreaking integration of our EA PLAY service with Microsoft Game Pass has accelerated our subscription business, with nearly 13 million players now active in our service across four platforms : Xbox, PlayStation, Steam and our EA client. With more players valuing the subscription model and with our scale across platforms and content, we are building a strong growing business with recurrent revenue. We also have new streaming players joining our network through Xbox cloud gaming, with Game Pass Ultimate and other partners. And we are committed to advancing cloud as a meaningful part of the future of the gaming ecosystem. FY \u201821 has been a year of outstanding growth while working through the challenges of the ongoing pandemic. Our execution continues to be strong even with our employees working from home and we expect that most will continue to do so through September. The creativity and innovation of our talented teams is enabling us to deliver more great experiences in our leading franchises and live services. We have a deep and robust pipeline of new content with more than 35 new games in various levels of incubation and development for the future. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing a lot more about our FY \u201822 plans in the months ahead, including our next Battlefield experience, which will mark a return to all-out military warfare. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation platforms to bring massive immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next edition of Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for and elevate it to another level. The team is focused and the game is ahead of our internal milestones. We will reveal the game in the spring and deliver defined Battlefield experience for our players in the 2021 holiday season. Games helped fill a great need in people\u2019s lives through 2020. Our franchise is aware so many around the world are coming for connection, entertainment and inspiration. We\u2019re looking forward to delivering more great experiences for hundreds of millions of people engaging with us and driving continued growth in our business through Q4 and into FY \u201822. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of $2.4 billion. We\u2019ve built our live services for longevity. FIFA and Madden have both been around for decades. Measured over the last 10 fiscal years, the FIFA franchise has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 50% and Madden at nearly 60%. The Sims 4 is on track for its sixth consecutive year of growth and Apex Legends for its second at the beginning of what we hope will be a similar long run for this title. I\u2019d reiterate and amplify here that we expect Apex to deliver well over $500 million in net bookings this year compared to our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. The Apex team has really embraced the playfulness of the characters and gameplay. The team has focused on having more fun in the craft of building and experimenting with new modes and ways to explore the APEX universe and characters. This has been paying off with a compound average growth rate of 14% per season as measured from season 2. That\u2019s equivalent to an annual -- compounded annual growth rate of about 65%. With regards to the sports opportunity, in particular, we estimate the worldwide sports video game software segment is about $7 billion on console and PC today. It\u2019s grown by about 13% annually since 2016. We\u2019re the leader in that segment and are now applying our full focus to the spectrum of sports opportunities from casual to core. The global gaming market for sports is presently about $4.3 billion in size and growing fast at about 24% a year. We\u2019re barely scratching the surface of this massive opportunity. But we have a lot of projects in flight and you\u2019ll hear more about our activities here in the year to come. Operationally, we\u2019re in working in challenging times, but we\u2019ve been able to lean into the advantages that come with our scale to deliver games of quality with remarkably little impact on timing. This quarter, we launched FIFA 21, NHL 21, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and Medal of Honor : Above and Beyond. We also extended FIFA and Madden to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Star Wars Jedi : Fallen Order to Stadia and added our EA PLAY services to Microsoft Game Pass. We continued a packed schedule of live events for Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden and NHL. We launched Season 7 for Apex and launched Season 8 today. We launched the Snowy Escapes package for The Sims. The step function jump in digital sales prompted by COVID appeared resilient with digital representing 62% of units sold through in the quarter, up 13 percentage points from last year. Mobile showed its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth with outperformance across the board this quarter, led by Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. We\u2019ll have much more to say about our mobile strategy later this year and we continue to be excited about the games we currently have in play. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, primarily driven by the phasing of marketing investments. We hit a new record in trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $2.06 billion. The quarter was very close to our record for quarterly cash flow, which we delivered back in Q3 fiscal 2017 with the help of Battlefield 1. Needless to say, we\u2019re excited about the potential for the next Battlefield in Q3 next fiscal year. Our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue was $5.6 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.447 billion and earnings per share of $2.54. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our recently announced 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We\u2019re raising our net bookings expectations for the year to be $6.075 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance. This is driven by continued strength in our live services, particularly FIFA and Apex Legends. It is $525 million above our expectations at the start of the year despite the changes we made to the product slate during the year. We expect this year to be 13% over prior year, even with a lighter release slate versus the prior year and an FX headwind of about $55 million. For the fourth quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.317 billion, cost of revenue to be $302 million and operating expenses of $837 million. This results in a loss per share of $0.07 for the fourth quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the fourth quarter to be $1.375 billion, which is an increase of $75 million over our prior guidance. We\u2019ve built a foundation for growth in fiscal 2022. We have successfully brought new people into our ecosystem. We\u2019re providing great content for people who want to spend more time there. We\u2019ve been working hard on new titles and new platforms. We expect this to deliver significant organic growth in fiscal 2022. Formal guidance will follow in our Q4 call, but I can tell you now that the Battlefield team is doing an incredible job. They\u2019re way ahead of where they were in product -- prior product cycles, on track for their earliest feature complete in franchise history. Meanwhile, the live service teams for FIFA, Apex Legends, The Sims and Madden all continue to outdo themselves. And of course, we\u2019ll have other surprises that we\u2019ll reveal when the time is right. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. Strong execution throughout FY \u201821 has brought us to this point and the drivers of future growth are foundational to our business. Our teams are creating amazing high-quality games and content for more players around the world than ever before. Our live services that extend and enhance these experiences are keeping players engaged over the long term. And we are transforming our business for continued expansion, growing our portfolio and enabling ways for players to connect with each other and engage deeply with their favorite content. We\u2019re looking forward to a strong Q4 and a year of continued growth in FY \u201822. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. It\u2019s Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. So you guys put out a statement last month that you have multiple Star Wars games still in development. I\u2019m just curious if you can give us an update on those franchises and what we should expect from 2023 forward. And then just the second one is at the point that you guys kind of came into the beginning of fiscal Q3, it was on the tail end of the summer. It felt like parts of the country had partially reopened before locking down again. So I just wonder what the experience you saw over the course of Q3 was in terms of had people churned out at the beginning, then came back into gaming as other entertainment options became more restricted. Or what did you see in user behavior over the course of the last quarter? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So let me jump into that in the context of Star Wars. We won\u2019t be announcing new things here. But what I would say is if you look at our history with Star Wars, we\u2019ve had a long and very profitable relationship, first, with Lucasart and then with -- or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney. We have generated a number of great franchises, Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic, Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront, Jedi: Fallen Order and most recently, Squadrons. That represents over $3 billion life-to-date net bookings and 52 million games sold. And Galaxy of Heroes is a $1 billion franchise. As we\u2019ve established the very strong part of that franchise, you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future. With respect to engagement more broadly, I think that we\u2019ve seen strong engagement throughout the last year. Blake and I have both been relatively conservative, I think, as we look to the future at each moment in time, but we feel good about where engagement has been. And we feel -- we now feel more confident that the increased engagement we\u2019ve seen in our experiences is likely to continue on a go-forward basis. Blake, I don\u2019t know if you have any more to add to that. Blake Jorgensen : No. I would say clearly, looking at Q3 in terms of live services and 24% growth year-over-year of live services should prove only one simple thing, which is engagement is stronger than we have ever seen. It is spectacular. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re fulfilling the social connection between people who love the same things, be it some sport, The Sims, Apex. Whatever it is, we figured out how to make that happen. And you don\u2019t see growth on $1.5 billion of revenue without knowing that that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the engagement and the social networks of what we\u2019ve created. And that\u2019s the secret sauce of what we\u2019ve done. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng : Great. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, just on Battlefield. With first-person shooters using free-to-play game mode to expand the top funnel, could you talk a little bit about your ambition to do something like that with Battlefield? Is there anything you could share with us about the content road map? And then my second question is just on the NCAA deal. For those of us who weren\u2019t around when you guys were doing -- I think Football 14 was the last one. Could you just give us some parameters in terms of what the units for -- unit demand for that game was like? Is that a good way to think about some of the future NCAA games that you\u2019ll do going forward? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : On Battlefield, we don\u2019t have anything more to share with you at this point other than we believe that it\u2019s going to usher in a new generation for Battlefield games and Battlefield fans and we\u2019ll be taking -- benefiting from the full power of next-gen platforms. And you should imagine that we\u2019re looking across all forms of the experience to ensure that this is exactly the game that Battlefield fans want to play and the game that we believe will drive growth in the Battlefield franchise. But more on that to come in the month ahead and we\u2019re excited to share more on that at the appropriate time. With respect to our college football game, again, this was kind of part of my past life leading EA SPORTS. It was a really strong game. It was a fan favorite game. It sold tens of millions of units over its life. And we expect that it will continue to be a really strong fan favorite game. It\u2019s measured by the amount of emails I get in my inbox each week requesting us to bring back this game. I think that we could look to the past as a factor for the future. But I\u2019d also say that I think college football, as a fan, audience has grown dramatically since we launched the last game in 2013. I also think the nature of gameplay has changed dramatically as we think about the future of sports and you heard us speak to the conversion of sports and entertainment more broadly. And so we\u2019re excited to bring that back in the years ahead. Michael Ng : Great. Thanks Andrew. That\u2019s really helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one on Apex and one on FIFA Mobile. So the first one, Apex, very excited for the Nintendo Switch version coming out in March. So with close to 80 million Switches sold worldwide and the fact that Japan is the game\u2019s No. 2 market, can you help us frame the Switch opportunity to the franchise reaching $1 billion in annual bookings versus growth coming from organic and mobile? And then secondly, on FIFA Mobile, can you expand a bit more on the current strategy in growing that title? I believe you mentioned there are six different FIFA games. Are they going to be similar with each other, just being localized for each region? Or are they completely separate games? And why not just have one title tied to the console, PC version like Madden? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So I\u2019ll start with Apex and then Andrew may want to jump on, on FIFA. So on Apex, clearly, as you said, Japan is the second-largest market for Apex, which is very exciting for us. And we know that it\u2019s one of the largest markets for the Nintendo Switch. And that\u2019s the reason we decided to put it out on Nintendo Switch. But we also know that Nintendo Switch is a global business, not just a Japanese business. We think the combination of Nintendo Switch, Apex plus mobile Apex will be very powerful. We believe mobile Apex will be in soft launch sometime in the next three to four months and hopefully gets into the marketplace quickly. Obviously, it will take longer to get into the market in China because of some of the regulatory issues. But in the rest of the world, we don\u2019t see those issues happening. But we also want to make sure it is the exact product that we want. I think the team is very dedicated to making sure the product is the perfect product for a global market. But they\u2019ve learned a lot from Japan. They\u2019ve learned a lot from character development and so forth in that market and we think that will continue to help us. And let\u2019s all remember, less than two years ago, no one knew this product existed. Today, it\u2019s over $1 billion. We think there is a huge upside to this product over time and I just encourage people to keep focused on that because we don\u2019t have a mobile product today. We don\u2019t have a Switch product today. There are still other platforms around the world that we might go on. This is an opportunity that will last for a very long time and we\u2019re trying to build it for the long range, not just a one-year blip. So we\u2019re very excited about it. With that, Andrew, I\u2019ll throw it over to you on the FIFA question. Andrew Wilson : Yes. On FIFA, I think the best way to think about this is soccer is the world\u2019s largest sport by a wide margin. Mobile is the world\u2019s largest gaming platform also, as it turns out, by a wide margin in terms of magnitude of players. What we know about soccer as we travel around the world and what we know about mobile as we look at the growing player base is that soccer means different things to different people in different markets. And certainly, as we look at the magnitude of players that come into the mobile ecosystem, they\u2019re often looking for different types of experiences with respect to subject matter that they love. And so as we look at our FIFA business, building off the strength of our licensing relationships on a global basis, we think there is an opportunity to deliver a number of different experiences across the mobile platform from different geographies and different player cohorts based on what they\u2019re looking for. And we think that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us. Mario Lu : Great. Helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ryan Gee : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question and answer. First, on live services. So I think the last quarter was down 7% year-over-year. This quarter was up, I think, 28%. But given the timing shift for some of the sports games, I don\u2019t know that either quarter is really that representative. So I was hoping you could clarify what the right cadence is for Ultimate Team since FIFA and Madden launched and how much live services this quarter may have benefited from subscriptions and Game Pass partnerships with Microsoft is like? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would say, Ryan -- thanks for the question. I\u2019d say the impact on subscriptions is relatively a rounding error. I would say year-over-year growth of 24% would imply that it\u2019s a pretty strong business. And last year, based on what I\u2019m looking -- the numbers I\u2019m looking at wasn\u2019t down. It was up year-over-year. It\u2019s been up year-over-year every year for I don\u2019t know how many years. So it is extremely strong and it\u2019s strong across almost all of our live services : FIFA, Apex, Madden, Medal of Honor and Sims. And even Hockey had one of the best quarters they\u2019ve seen in years. And so what I would try to remember is the bulk of our business this quarter is still live services. And we\u2019re seeing incredible growth across it year-over-year. And subscription, while there\u2019s nice growth, it\u2019s still very small compared to the overall live services growth across all of the games. Ryan Gee : Okay. Yes, I was referring to the down last quarter because there was timing of FIFA for live services down year-over-year, but I get your point nonetheless. The other question was really just -- could you kind of give us -- with the new next-gen consoles out there in the market, can you give us maybe your high-level observations on consumer response and how the pace of adoption has been relative to your expectations and whether those that now have the console, the new one, have exhibited any different purchase behavior, time spent, engagement versus the prior gen? That would be great. Andrew Wilson : Yes. On balance, it\u2019s probably a better question for Microsoft and Sony at this point. I think it\u2019s too early to tell for us. I mean anecdotally, what we know to be true is demand is extraordinarily high for both consoles and that retailers, both digital and physical, are struggling to keep them in stock. What we\u2019ve seen is the games that we\u2019ve been able to build on those platforms are really, really strong. And as I look to the games that we\u2019re going to be able to build on those platforms on a go-forward basis, I\u2019m really excited about the new innovations and creativity and gameplay we\u2019re going to be able to deliver. And inevitably, I think that is going to offer a more engaging and immersive experience for our players that will ultimately see growth both in players overall and the time spent in our games. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Todd Juenger : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve also got two, one on basketball and one on the broad topic of social. Just if you talk about the expansion of sports and lots of dimensions, noticeably absent was any mention of NBA or basketball. I just wondered if you could comment on your sort of latest thinking on that. And in particular, maybe college basketball might be a particular opportunity white space there. That certainly has a large fan base and wonder if that is a potential way for you guys to get back in the basketball business in a big way. Second question on the broad topic of social. It\u2019s a pretty broad question. I\u2019ll try and make it short. But I think the word social was mentioned in your prepared remarks multiple times. Surely, we all could agree that the convergence of what we call gaming and social is happening in front of our eyes, Fortnite, Roblox. Just wondered how you think about, as you evolve your portfolio of games, what that means for your evolution, where your biggest opportunities are to take advantage of that. To me, clearly, The Sims is an obvious place that comes to mind. Are you proactively doing anything to be more sort of aggressive in pursuing that aspect of gaming? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Two great questions. First off, no announcement on basketball to make today. I would say two things. One, I think we underperformed on basketball over the last number of years and that\u2019s been very disappointing to us. With that said, we continue to have a really good relationship with the NBA and remain committed to basketball long term. And you should imagine that we are thinking through the best ways for us to use the strength of our business, the strength of our technology and the amazing creativity of our teams to deliver really cool, new, innovative experiences for basketball fans. With respect to social, in general, the short answer is yes. Part of what we have recognized now is that our players, particularly over the last year, have been using our games as ways to remain connected with their friends even while they are apart. And you may have heard me say this before, but social interaction is moving from physical to digital more broadly for the Gen Z population. And the consumption of sport and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive for the Gen Z population and we kind of sit at the very intersection of those two secular trends. And so what we\u2019ve started to do is really build around our content to ensure that we are providing more social opportunities for our fans and the Madden, Pro Bowl over the weekend was one such example of how we can take our game at the center of a social ecosystem and build around that for fans, both fans who play our games and fans who interact with plays of our games. When we think about our sports franchises, when we think about Apex, when we think about The Sims, when we think about mobile on a go-forward basis, we think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to build more into that and deliver on the social interaction our fans are asking for. And you should expect us to talk more about that in the future as we think about community, commentary, social interaction, competition, all wrapped in the data that our Gen Z fans are using on a day-to-day basis to play our games. Todd Juenger : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Mike Hickey : Hey, Andrew, Blake. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two as well. The first one on your BioWare studio. It looked like you\u2019ve had a few more executives turn over there. I think Casey and Mark left the studio. Can you update us on the executive leadership of BioWare and the product road map from those guys? Would be helpful. And then on Star Wars, obviously, that license is not exclusive. It seems like you\u2019d probably be doing less years. How do you think about sort of realigning your development resources? And broadly speaking, how do you think about licensed IP versus owned IP in the sort of non-sports category? Thanks, guys. Andrew Wilson : Two great questions. First off, on BioWare, again, that is an incredible studio filled with incredible people who do incredible work. And I think that from the outside wall, there have been some blips in their delivery over the last couple of years, but that has come as a result of them pushing deeply into innovation and creativity. And we feel very, very confident about their future road map and we\u2019ve talked about games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect in their future. With respect to Casey and Mark leaving, again, both good friends of mine. We have tremendous respect for both of them. But this happens in the natural course of creative organizations from time to time. And we feel very, very good about the ongoing leadership of that studio and the many people who come to work every day to deliver great innovation and creativity. We look forward to sharing more about what\u2019s coming from BioWare in the near future. And you will have just seen our Mass Effect trilogy Legendary Edition announced and that has been extraordinarily well received by BioWare fans. And so we\u2019re encouraged by what that studio will continue to deliver. In terms of Star Wars, I don\u2019t think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games. And as I said before, we\u2019ve had a long partnership with Disney, both before our exclusive period that gave us a great opportunity to really establish some very strong franchises like Battlefront, like Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, like Jedi : Fallen Order, like Squadrons. You should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It\u2019s been very profitable, to this point, over $3 billion in net bookings and we\u2019re excited by what we\u2019ll be able to do in the future. But you shouldn\u2019t read this as necessarily us building the less titles. I think what you should take from us more broadly as a company is that we believe in our ability to execute and deliver great, high-quality, deeply engaging content for our fans across both our sports business, our wholly owned IP business and our licensed partnership business like the one we have with Star Wars. And we feel confident and comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver great games for the future. Mike Hickey : Thanks guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open. Drew Crum : Okay. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. A question on Codemasters as it relates to your commentary on sports and the accompanying growth rates by platform. How has racing as a genre performed? And how quickly would you intend to ramp live services on the Codemasters titles? My second question for Sims to your guidance. So last year, with fiscal 3Q earnings, you suggested that fiscal \u201822 growth would accelerate with the next-gen consoles and Battlefield serving as the key drivers. Maybe fast forward to today, your comp will presumably be much higher than where you thought it would be. But you still have those two pieces in place, plus you\u2019re adding Codemasters and you\u2019ve talked about a number of initiatives with FIFA and Apex today. So given that, is accelerating growth in fiscal \u201822 remotely possible? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Let me -- Drew, let me start with the second question. We wouldn\u2019t come out and say that accelerating growth was possible, but we\u2019re confident of it -- if we weren\u2019t confident of it. I mean what we\u2019re saying is we believe that the trends that we see in this year\u2019s business will continue. We have Battlefield next year and we haven\u2019t actually even put in place what we think Codex -- or Codemasters could deliver because the deal is not closed yet. And so we\u2019re clearly thinking and saying we see -- coming off of the year in which we started at $5.55 billion, we\u2019re now telling people we\u2019re close to $6.1 billion in revenue. And we\u2019re telling people we\u2019re going to grow again next year. I think you guys should take that as an incredible level of commitment and confidence on where the business is going, absent even additions from nonorganic growth because we spilled out, this is organic growth we\u2019re talking about. And so I would get people -- I\u2019d be very focused on that. There is a lot of spin right now in the marketplace around the fact that we decided to capitalize part of the GILTI tax regimes, R&D expenses in our fourth quarter to try to get behind it because we had a strong year. And so the reason we have a fourth quarter that shows a GAAP -- not a non-GAAP, but a GAAP decline in an EPS is purely getting ahead of what is going to be a tax cost for every company out there that gets hit by GILTI. And we\u2019re trying to be aggressive and stay in front of that. But the cash impact of that is minimal. And we think in a year in which we are already well above our EPS and our earnings, it was the exact right thing to do. And I\u2019m not sure why everyone wants to spin on that, but I would dig in a little bit, ask the questions and make sure you understand what that really means. I know that\u2019s not the question you asked. But I want to make sure it\u2019s clear to everybody that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on right now. Now Codex on its own could be a nice addition to the company. We know that they have some incredible franchises. The F1 franchise is so nascent. It\u2019s a new franchise for them. We know if you\u2019re based in the U.S., there\u2019s very little F1 racing going on in the U.S. And yet we know that the owners of F1 would like to build an F1 business in the U.S. We know that there\u2019s still expansion around the globe. It is probably one of the best growth opportunities there is and the reason that we\u2019re willing to pay what we were willing to pay for it, on top of the fact that the DiRT franchise, the GRID franchise, all of their franchises are incredible games, but none of them have actually taken advantage of a large publishing organization and a marketing muscle that we\u2019re able to deliver. And we think that has growth to it, not to mention the talent that\u2019s in that organization that could continue to help our Need for Speed business or our Real Racing business. It could be very powerful. So we know it is not a FIFA-sized business, but we know there is incredible opportunity to own essentially all of the driving business there is. So with that passionate answer, I\u2019ve forgotten what your other question was. So... Drew Crum : Yes, how racing is performed in the category? Blake Jorgensen : Well, you know what, we know that every year, we put out a Need for Speed, it does extremely well. It\u2019s one of those kind of games that if mom goes into the store or goes online and doesn\u2019t want her son or daughter to be playing something that might look a little too competitive or might be too sports-oriented, driving has always been an incredible opportunity in the marketplace. And we know it\u2019s not going to be the size of FIFA, but we believe that there is a huge potential, particularly as you think about the growth of the underlying franchises that we might be able to help drive. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about it. Drew Crum : Thanks Blake. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Matthew Thornton : Hey. Good afternoon, Andrew and Blake. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I could. One, just touching back on Codemasters again and then just one on some of the FIFA mobile and online initiatives. On Codemasters, can you talk maybe just conceptually about what cadence could look like in that genre? Because obviously, you already have Need for Speed in the docket for next year. But is that a genre where you could conceivably see a track title plus a rally title plus a street title every year? Or does that get too crowded? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about cadence maybe just conceptually because I know that the deal is not closed yet. And then just secondly and I apologize if you hit on this. The initiatives around FIFA Mobile, the six games in development as well as the PC online for expansion to more markets, any time line color you could provide and kind of when that commences, when it starts, when we start to see developments and how fast that kind of happens? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks, guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So let me -- on Codemasters, it\u2019s still early -- too early for us to kind of be able to outline all of that. Again, the deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. But as I think about this as an opportunity, I start with the fact that we will be able to bring together all of the greatest racing talent in our industry or most of the great racing talent in our industry. When I think about taking that collection of talent and pointing them at Need for Speed, pointing them at FORMULA ONE, pointing them at GRID, pointing them at DiRT and thinking about how all of that might happen with regular launches of those titles with really strong live services wrapped around them which we don\u2019t yet see in the Codemasters games, all powered by the leverage of the marketing organization that we have behind us, I think the opportunity is really, really strong. And so you should imagine that as we think about this, Need for Speed, which is already one of the leading racing franchises that we launch every other year, we think there might be opportunities around growth of releases and certainly growth of that title. We think that F1 plus live service plus our marketing muscle is a profound opportunity. And we think that GRID and DiRT also represent great new additions to our portfolio. But the big win here is bringing together what we believe is going to be the greatest collection of racing talent in the industry. With respect to FIFA, all of these things are in play. You will have seen and we talked about this, even our existing FIFA Mobile game has grown year-over-year. Our FIFA Mobile Asia game continues to expand and has grown year-over-year. We are working with KLab in Japan on a Japanese-inspired game, folks on the Japanese market that we believe will have global appeal. But Jeff Karp has come into our mobile organization. We\u2019ve consolidated that organization. We brought all of sports and all other mobile titles together and we have identified sport and particularly soccer as a really, really big global opportunity. As a background, Jeff at one time ran marketing for EA SPORTS many, many years ago. On leaving EA, he ran a number of mobile companies and has come back and is having a tremendous impact on that business. And so no more announcements specifically today, but you should expect over the next year or two that we\u2019re going to roll out growth in this business. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Your line is open. Andrew Marok : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. With the news on FIFA today, I guess if we could just get some of your updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about the market opportunity for FIFA and Madden and Stadia. And to the extent that it\u2019s relevant, are there any learnings to take away from Jedi on the platform so far that could be brought to sports? And then second, as Apex expands, it really just has the one core game mode right now. And as you\u2019re looking into options like Switch and mobile, could that potentially expand? And in that case, would that put increased overlap with Battlefield on the table? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : On FIFA, Madden and Stadia, again, this is early. We believe that cloud is going to have a tremendously positive impact on total addressable market in our industry over the long term. And we also think that cloud is going to offer all kinds of new innovation and creativity about the types of games we can build where we can harness the power of cloud compute, compute at the edge and 5G networks that drive latency-free gameplay in between those two end points. And so when we think about Stadia right now, it\u2019s really about working with our cloud partners to innovate and lead in what we believe is going to be a meaningful future for our industry over time. With respect to Apex, no announcements here. I would just come back to Respawn are amazingly creative as a studio. They\u2019ve built unbelievable games both in the content of Titanfall Apex and more recently, Jedi: Fallen Order. As we continue to expand that -- they\u2019re on their eighth -- they\u2019ve just launched their eighth season. Every season adds new characters and new gameplay and at some point, new maps. You should imagine that, that team is thinking about how to further expand that universe over time and we\u2019ll be excited to share more about that in the future. Andrew Marok : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Parker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tyler Parker : Hey thanks guys. I just wanted one more question on college football. Without student athlete images and likeness this time, it\u2019s going to look a bit different than historically. So I\u2019m curious what we know historically about gamers\u2019 motivations. Are they going in there to play their favorite players or play their favorite teams? How is that going to look? And how do you expect them to react to a game that doesn\u2019t have necessarily student athlete names and likeness in there? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : You might remember that our last game also didn\u2019t have student name and likeness. The game has always been built on the power of the relationship that fans have with their colleges. We\u2019ll have over 100 colleges, all of the logos and kits and stadiums and on-field pageantry that makes college football great. And we are very excited and believe that we can build a really compelling college football game with all of those components in partnership with schools across the country. And the response that we\u2019ve had to the announcement kind of ratifies that excitement. So you should hear more from us on that in the months ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Eric Handler : Hi, thanks for the question. I actually got two questions. First, Blake, I think you did touch on a GAAP basis, but your fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance for operating expenses is like 719 -- $718 million, $719 million, which is a huge step-up from last year\u2019s third quarter and a step-up from the normally big third quarter. So what\u2019s really driving that increase? And should that carry over into next year as well? And then I have a follow-up question for Andrew. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So think about it, Eric, as a couple of things. One is we\u2019ve continued to try to do everything possible to support our workforce in a work-from-home mode and COVID support. And so you can assume that some portion of those expenses are associated with that and maybe expenses that would drift into next year. Second is we are having -- obviously, we\u2019re having one of the best years we\u2019ve ever had. And what does that mean for us? It means we want to take advantage of the strength in our organization and the ability to hire people, particularly when other companies are not able to do that. And we think this is a unique opportunity for us to go out and continue to try to grow great teams. I mean to give you a simple example. It\u2019s not like we have a group of people just sitting around doing nothing that are waiting to build college football. We\u2019re going to need to grow a team to do that. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think manage the economics of our teams well. But we\u2019re going to continue to hire people particularly in a time in which we\u2019ve been able to prove to our employees and those people who see our employees that we are a great place to work. And so that\u2019s driving some of the uptick in expenses that you\u2019re seeing. And then I would just go back in history and look at, okay, how good were we at always forecasting OpEx? Are we that good at it? Probably not. So with that I\u2019ll turn it to Andrew for your second question. Eric Handler : Thanks, Blake. Andrew, one big picture question here. When you look at the success Roblox has seen this year and obviously Minecraft has been a huge hit, do you think any of your content could translate well to sort of a user-generated platform? Andrew Wilson : Great question. And the short answer is yes. And again Sims has been a user-generated platform since its inception. And we\u2019ve seen creation and sharing on that platform, maybe not to the extent of a Minecraft or a Roblox certainly but as we look at the Maxis team that\u2019s certainly something that is front and center to how they think about that franchise. We\u2019re also thinking about this in the context of some of our new experiences and we have an entire group inside the company right now focused on player agency and creation at a player level. And as we roll out those experience over time you should expect that some of those will be kind of bound to a gain in the way that Minecraft is that -- Sims and Maxis would be a great example of that. And some of those will be platform level. Again, we have some great game development tools and we think over time, there might be an opportunity to share those with our communities and allow them to create new content with those tools over time. It\u2019s certainly a developing area of our industry. It\u2019s something that Gen Z players are really gravitating towards. And when we think about developing a social network for Gen Z plays around each of our major franchises, we think about user-generated content as a very central strand of the DNA of those experiences in those communities. Eric Handler : Okay. Thank you very much. So I think \u2013 Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Mike. Welcome everyone to EA\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. With me from their homes today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, and a transcript. Once again, I\u2019d like to direct you to the earnings slides this quarter. They now contain the metrics and color that we historically have included in Blake\u2019s remarks. With regards to our calendar : our Q1 fiscal 2022 earnings call is scheduled for Wednesday, August 4. As a reminder, we post the schedule of our entire year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 11, 2021, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you staying healthy and well. I want to start today by saying welcome to our newest teammates from Codemasters, Glu Mobile, and Metalhead Software. We\u2019re very excited to have added these incredibly talented teams to the EA family, and we\u2019re looking forward to creating some amazing new experiences together. FY2021 was a record year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our games continues to expand worldwide, leading industry transformation and fueling demand from a new generation of players that will continue for years to come. We delivered 13 new games in FY 2021, and welcomed more than 42 million new players to our network of more than 500 million unique accounts. The tremendous engagement across our leading live services is a powerful demonstration of how players are coming together and forming social networks through our experiences. We drove net bookings growth of more than $600 million above our original guidance for the fiscal year, and achieved bottom line results significantly ahead of our expectations. Our teams continue to deliver for our players despite the challenges of the pandemic, and our execution of long-term strategies to create exceptional, high-quality experiences, drive growth through our leading live services, and expand our reach to more players, are continuing to build strength in our business. As we look forward into FY2022, we are accelerating, powered by organic growth in our existing business, development of new businesses, and layering in growth from recent acquisitions. We\u2019re forecasting strong growth in FY2022. Our net bookings guidance reflects 18% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion. This includes organic growth in our core business and the addition of the Glu, Codemasters and Metalhead acquisitions. From this position of strength, we are also investing in the future of our business, and we expect to continue to grow underlying profitability. I want to spend time today on three primary growth drivers for us in FY2022 : expanding the EA SPORTS business, growing our Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises, and our mobile growth strategy. We have a foundational strategy for growing these blockbuster brands that we are applying here : best-in-class premium experiences, deeply engaging live services that create social networks in our games, and expansion to more platforms, new business models, and new geographies. This model is how we\u2019ve built FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL and The Sims into some of the most successful, global live service businesses in the industry, and we are applying it as a blueprint across our franchises. As the undisputed leader in sports games, EA SPORTS is moving from strength to strength as we grow our current business and include more sports and reach new audiences. In FY2021, our EA SPORTS games brought players together at record levels. Our EA SPORTS FIFA experiences continue to engage more than 100 million players worldwide. More than 20 million players played FIFA Ultimate Team in the last year, and FIFA Ultimate Team matches were up an incredible 180%. Madden NFL had its biggest year ever, and games across our EA SPORTS portfolio continue to acquire more players than ever before. We\u2019ll now build on that strength with a massive year of innovation and expansion. All of our new EA SPORTS games in FY2022 are designed for next-gen console platforms, including FIFA, Madden, NHL and EA SPORTS PGA Tour, our return to golf that is set for Q4 of this year. We\u2019re very excited by the opportunity to deliver for baseball fans around the world with the addition of Super Mega Baseball from Metalhead Software, and MLB TapSports Baseball on mobile from the Glu team. EA SPORTS is also publishing the highest-rated sports franchise in the world with F1 2021, our first title from our recently-completed Codemasters acquisition. And with the combined expertise of the Glu and EA teams focused on engaging more sports fans, we plan to grow our sports mobile business by over 50% this year. We continue to see the consumption of sports move from linear to interactive, representing a major growth opportunity for us spanning more sports and more platforms, especially mobile. From premium experiences to live services to mobile, EA SPORTS is in an unparalleled position to reach more players with new ways to play, watch and connect. With Apex Legends and Battlefield, we have two leading franchises in their category. We are positioned for continued growth in FY2022 through new launches, expansion to mobile, and preparing for the addition of new business models that will expand our total addressable audience. Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year and we are forecasting continued growth. Season 8 saw well over 12 million weekly active users, the highest levels we\u2019ve seen since season 1 in 2019. We\u2019re also seeing explosive growth for Apex in Asia, especially in Japan where it has grown significantly in the last three quarters. As Respawn continues to deliver more new content and evolve the main game this year, we are also beginning regional beta testing of Apex Legends Mobile. This is a new experience designed specifically for touchscreens, which we expect to launch worldwide later this fiscal year. Apex Legends continues to have tremendous momentum and is growing in every dimension. We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY2022, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. We are realizing the next phase of growth in our vision for Battlefield with two new experiences launching in FY2022. Three world-class studios, DICE Stockholm, Criterion and DICE LA, and our technology team in Gothenburg now form our largest-ever Battlefield development team. They are working in lock-step to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for Battlefield fans. The game has everything fans love about Battlefield, epic scale, all-out warfare, unexpected moments and game-changing destruction, and takes it all to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and PCs. We\u2019re excited to reveal the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout the summer. We also have a Battlefield game for mobile platforms in development at Industrial Toys, in close partnership with DICE. Built from the ground up for mobile, the game is going into early testing now, and we\u2019re looking forward to players around the world getting their hands on this innovative Battlefield experience later in FY2022. As I mentioned before, our strategy is to grow Battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Apex, best-in-class gameplay, deeply-engaging live service, a new mobile experience, and more ways to play that we will introduce to reach more players all over the world. Throughout FY2022, we will continue transforming mobile into a growth center for our business. With the recent re-organization and hiring of new leadership and talent into our EA mobile teams, we are in position to maximize our leading mobile live services, including Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims and Real Racing, by growing player acquisition, deepening engagement and player investment, and driving new opportunities in non-western markets. We will grow in sports mobile with innovation in our leading franchises including FIFA, Madden, and UFC, as well as the addition of MLB TapSports Baseball to our mobile sports portfolio. We expect our two biggest shooter franchises to launch on mobile for the first time in FY2022, which is another demonstration of our multi-platform strategy for leading global franchises. With the addition of Glu layered onto our EA mobile growth plans, we expect to more than double our mobile business to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next three years. We have a year of strong growth ahead in FY2022, and we see many more opportunities as we continue to lead in the expansion and transformation of the industry. We have a very clear long-term growth strategy for our biggest blockbuster franchises. This is the foundation of our business, and you\u2019re seeing us grow all major platforms and business models. We\u2019re thrilled to have the teams from Codemasters, Glu and Metalhead join our Electronic Arts family, and together we expect to develop many games and experiences that will delight our growing player base and be catalysts for growth in the years to come. We have a deep pipeline of new content, including new franchises and new IP, deeper focus on mobile games, and experiences that will lean into user-generated content. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in opportunities where we have differentiated ability to reach and engage more players including our growing subscription service, and our esports content and competitions that will expand in scope this year. The three growth drivers that I\u2019ve focused on today, expanding our EA SPORTS portfolio, growing our blockbuster shooter franchises, and the transformation of our mobile business, provide clear growth and significant upside for Electronic Arts in FY2022 and beyond. We\u2019re excited to bring some amazing new games and content to our players and viewers around the world this year. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake. A - Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily, an extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Apex\u2019s phenomenal engagement stats. As a result of that engagement, Apex delivered its largest net bookings quarter on record. It also delivered the best day, the best 24-hour period, the best week, the best month and best in-game event. We suggested it would deliver over $1 billion in life-to-date net bookings by the end of the quarter; it actually passed that milestone with half of the quarter to go. Apex Legends delivered over $600 million for the year, well above our original expectation of $300 million to $400 million. Importantly, Apex Legends steadily grew through the last year. While Apex surely benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind, the upwards trajectory is driven by the game teams and the content they are delivering. That is, this strength is structural. To this point, Season 8 was the first season built by a new content team we\u2019ve put together in Vancouver, proving our ability to scale resources on our fastest-growing franchise. Our two major shooter franchises, Apex Legends and Battlefield, and our ongoing strength in Ultimate Team, provides a tremendous foundation for growth in FY2022. The addition of Glu and Codemasters accelerates this to 18% revenue growth year-on-year. I\u2019ll go through the details of our guidance in a moment. First, though, I\u2019ll start with a quick look at what we achieved in fiscal 2021. We closed out the year with $5.63 billion in net revenue. We delivered net bookings of $6.19 billion, the highest in our history, and about $640 million above our original expectations. Underlying profit was also an all-time record, as was full year operating cash flow of $1.93 billion. Of that $6.19 billion in net bookings, $4.6 billion was live services. There couldn\u2019t be a more dramatic illustration of the way the business has evolved, with our focus on engagement and ongoing entertainment now generating three-quarters of our net bookings. To give some perspective, that $4.6 billion is equivalent to the sale of around 130 million copies of console games. Digital represented 62% of our full game units sold in fiscal 2021 for consoles, up 13 percentage points from last year. Turning to Q4 specifically, the beat was driven by live services, primarily Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. Mobile also beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes and SimCity BuildIt. Operating expenses came in very slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by acquisition-related expenses. Now turning now to guidance. We expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.8 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.828 billion, and earnings per share of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our two-year, $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We expect operating cash flows of $1.750 billion and capital expenditures to be around $250 million, which would deliver free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. Cash flow is down year-on-year, primarily due to tax integration costs associated with the acquisitions. The level of these costs reflect the strength of the IP Glu and Codemasters have developed and bring to EA. CapEx is up temporarily, with office build outs in Bucharest, Los Angeles, Orlando and the United Kingdom. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We expect fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $7.3 billion, up about 18% over fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022, and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year. In sports, we expect FIFA and Madden to be strong and we\u2019re launching a new PGA Tour golf game. F1 2021, developed by Codemasters and which now sits under the EA Sports banner, will launch on July 16. And, of course, rounding out the year for our shooter franchises is the launch of Battlefield in the holiday season. Because this is the first time we\u2019re forecasting Glu and Codemasters, we took a very conservative posture on net bookings from those businesses. In addition, we\u2019re not yet modeling any synergies from the two acquisitions. For fiscal 2022, we\u2019ve assumed simple addition of their existing businesses in the EA. Revenue and synergies will come further out, as we combine our IP with Glu\u2019s mobile expertise to build a suite of new casual mobile games, leverage our sports know-how with Codemasters' F1 franchise, and implement a holistic strategy for racing games. Meanwhile, OpEx this year will be impacted by some one-time costs associated with the acquisitions. We're also leaning heavily into our biggest franchises, with increased R&D investments, and marketing ahead of the key launches of Battlefield and Apex Mobile. We expect these near-term investments to pay off in years to come. For the first quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.475 billion, cost of revenue to be $287 million, and operating expenses of $955 million. This results in an earnings per share of $0.24 for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.25 billion. We expect Apex Legends momentum will carry through to fiscal 2022. Given what we\u2019ve seen of the game already, we believe our financial model of Battlefield may be conservative, and we\u2019re looking forward to player reaction when we reveal this game next month. In addition, we\u2019re very excited for the franchise as a whole, as we add new platforms and business models. We expect strong organic growth this year, growth that is further accelerated by the addition of the talented teams at Codemasters and Glu and Metalhead. It is an exciting time for Electronic Arts. Now I\u2019ll hand back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up our remarks here, I want to share a heartfelt congratulations to Respawn Entertainment. The team achieved another amazing milestone last month, when they received the gaming industry's first Academy Award for co-producing the documentary short subject Colette, which was released within the Medal of Honor : Above & Beyond VR experience. Congratulations to Vince, Dusty, Peter and the entire team, it is a truly outstanding achievement, and such an incredible recognition of the creativity and passion for groundbreaking work that all of our teams put into our games. Games are bringing joy to more players around the world than ever before, and our experiences are bringing hundreds of millions of players together. Our business has never been stronger, we have clear growth drivers accelerating our trajectory in FY2022, and our acquisitions are new catalysts for growth. As we continue building blockbuster franchises with best-in-class live services that reach and connect players on more platforms and in more geographies around the world, we see significant upside for Electronic Arts this year and in the years to come. Thank you to our teams for their incredible work delivering for our players every day. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. First off, Blake, it looks like services on console and PC increased almost 40% in fiscal Q4 if I have the apples to apples numbers there, right. So curious how you expect that portion of the business to track in Q1 and in the next fiscal year? And then, secondly, Andrew within core EA, it sounds like you have a pretty ambitious roadmap for new releases in live ops So I'm curious if you have the studio structure and the development team and resources in place now where you're comfortable with in order to execute in that pipeline? Or are there still some gaps that need to be filled in? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Colin. It's Blake. We've seen across the board live services increases. Clearly, Apex has driven a huge change in that business. It's up dramatically year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone year-over-year, it's up 145%. And the way we've done that as you know is continue to add amazing content, amazing characters, amazing things for people to play, and it's engaging more and more people all the time. While COVID as horrible as it has been brought a lot of people into gaming and what we've done is try to do our best to bring more and more people into social networks around the games they love, be it sports, be it shooter game, be it The Sims and that's what we've been able to leverage over time and those people stay in those social networks because they enjoy the game and enjoy the people they're playing with. And so, we see across all of our live services, Ultimate Team, Apex, The Sims, all of our mobile games that have helped us get the confidence that we could give the guidance that we just provided for next year. And I think you're going to continue to see that as a huge part of our business. It's going to be a huge part of the industry business as we've already seen, but it will continue on for us and we'll continue to add to that with new content, new ways to play, new opportunities for people to deeply get connected with other people that like what they like to do. Andrew Wilson : And on the same question, great question, we feel really good about our studio organization, as you heard in the prepared remarks and you've heard me talk about before over the last year we really reorganized our mobile group. We brought in new leadership, both at the very top of the organization and throughout the organization, who really bring great global expertise and experience and knowledge and know-how, and of course, bringing in Codemasters \u2013 bringing in Glu Mobile to that group puts us in a really, really strong position for an increased focus on mobile, where we see tremendous growth opportunity. Across the rest of our studio structure, I also feel really, really good about our leadership and all of our creative talent there. Again, we've brought in Codemasters, which are some of the leading racing developers in the world. You'll see more from us around our holistic racing strategy, but F1 is already looking really, really strong for this year. And we've been recruiting over the last 12 to 18 months, some amazing industry-leading talent, some of those have been announced, some announced yet, but we have a very ambitious growth plan ahead and we feel really good about the structure we have in place. Of course we'll always be tuning and balancing that all the time, but I feel blessed and lucky to have the creative leadership and the creative talent that we do to achieve the things that we have planned. Colin Sebastian : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay, thank you. So, Andrew, Blake I think investors have been waiting for the audience unlock from mobile for some time now, particularly as it comes to your larger franchises. So, can you talk about the initial integration plans with the good folks at Glu and you know what that might look like from a franchise by franchise standpoint? So, what are the opportunities to get you to one plus one to be more than two so that, Blake, your forecasting guidance parameters that's going to be greater than just a straight forward addition of these on to EA's existing results. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : I would say from a philosophical standpoint, our orientation around Glu is to protect and amplify ensure that we protect the creative integrity, the cultural integrity of that organization. They have been very, very successful in developing great games like Design Home and Tap Sports Baseball and many others. But we also want to give them access to our IP, to our technology, to our market, our global marketing reach and the network of 500 million unique accounts that we have and we feel that the combination of those two things represents an extraordinary opportunity. But at the same time also been working on our organic \u2013 on the EA model team around organic growth and you\u2019ve heard me talk about significant increase in the S&R [indiscernible] franchise, a relaunch of Madden and UFC, aggressive plans around The Sims and a number of other properties including Battlefield and Apex Legends. And so our sense is we expect with the reorganization and focus on mobile, bringing in Glu to the organization with kind of protect and amplify orientation and the collective growth plans that we have an investment that we\u2019re making, we have tremendous upside opportunity at a time where brands are breaking through more stronger than most anything else in the mobile market. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, maybe but follow-on to Stephen\u2019s question. And that\u2019s around with all the M&A activity you\u2019ve seen on the mobile side, AppLovin and Machine Zone, and then they also just bought Adjust and then you guys the Glu and Zynga with Chartboost. Is the mobile piece, the advertising piece of that and the cross platform piece is that an initiative that\u2019s going to kind of catalyze a more vertically integrated approach to the business, a more holistic and robust approach to consumer engagement and how you monetize those guys lifetime value yield perspective. Are you missing anything on the ad tech side, do you think for premier kind of holistic mobile approach? Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I would say it\u2019s too early to say on ad tech. We know there is a lot of changes going on in the market as you guys know and we\u2019ll watch closely as to how those changes may impact advertising inside of the mobile games. We also know that most mobile gaming advertising is for other mobile games and we\u2019ve always wanted to try to keep people in our own network, right or wrong, but that\u2019s been our focus. I think the near-term opportunity is really the talent that these teams have that could impact our own franchises in the IP that we have in those franchises. So building more casual games for example, building new sports games. I think that\u2019s where we were most excited about Glu and the reason we bought them. And I think longer-term, over the next couple of years as we see how the ad business changes, we might be more aggressive there, but really this is about building new franchises with great talent. Brian Fitzgerald : Got it. Thanks Blake, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Alexia Quadrani : Hi, thank you. Can you elaborate on the success, the tremendous success you\u2019ve seen in Apex Legends? I mean is it a core group of players playing the game more and more season after season? Or have you notably expanded the player bases well? And any update on timeline of Apex for China? Andrew Wilson : I would say as we look at the data on Apex Legends, we have seen from season to season, what the Apex Legends team have been able to do is grow pretty much every meaningful metric around the business. The amount of players, the amount of time players spend, the amount of connections players have in the game, the amount of touch point the players have and of course revenue generation from that growing player base. I think as we project forward, what they have done from the very beginning is ensure that they always protect the gaming community, but they\u2019re very close and listen to the gaming community offering what that community wants, the day to day retention is off the charts for free to play game and that\u2019s why we are confident in projecting future growth around both the existing base and then of course Apex Mobile. And what we talked about is releasing or soft launching Apex Mobile later this year as is the nature of mobile games, we have a series of closed beta tests, open beta tests and then soft launches to ensure we are appropriately treating the metrics. We\u2019ve not gotten big numbers in our plan this year forward, Blake can comment more on that. But what we\u2019ve really done is apply the same orientation the team has had around the core franchise, which is let\u2019s make sure we get the game play right, let\u2019s make sure we get the event strategy around the game play right and let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re looking at players and delivering on what players want out of that experience. That is growing every meaningful metric of Apex Legends every single season since launch and our expectation is that we\u2019ll also be able to grow that in the same way in mobile. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, and we\u2019ve put really \u2013 as I think Andrew mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve put relatively little revenue in for Apex Mobile in this coming year because you don\u2019t know exactly when you will release the mobile game. You want to make sure you test it, tune it and then release it at the right time and that\u2019s globally, including China. We believe there are some huge markets for Apex mobile, as Andrew also mentioned, Japan is one of our largest markets for the console and PC game and the switch game. And so, we believe it will be a huge market for mobile, so we will prioritize some of those markets, but we also know people love the game all around the world, so more to come on that. I would just trust that we have not put a large number in our forecast for Apex mobile yet, because of some of those unknowns. Alexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : Hi, thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the comment about how the new EA SPORTS or design for next-gen, what does that enable from a pricing perspective. And then separately, I think, you made similar comments around Battlefield as well. For Battlefield, specifically, will that be available for both current gen and next-gen? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : So yes, Battlefield will be available for both current gen and next-gen as well as sports titles. The reference specifically from our prepared remarks is around the nature of game play, what we can do with fidelity of the game, what we can do with physics, artificial intelligence and the immersive nature of the game. And in the case of Battlefield, what we can do with respect to the amount of plays that we can have in the game and the nature of destruction of those only in Battlefield moments that are truly next-gen opportunities that we\u2019re able to do in the context of our next-gen franchises, because of the increased processing power in memory and output of the new consoles. We\u2019re really excited about that what that means for our products. If you go back to the history of our industry, every time we were able to deliver high fidelity, more meaningfully immersive products as a result of increased processing powered platform transitions, we\u2019ve been able to grow the market dramatically. And sports and games like Battlefield have been leaders on that every platform generation shift. And we\u2019re excited by the fact our entire EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield will be developed specifically around features for next-gen players. Michael Ng : Great, thank you very much. And just a follow-up if I may. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Ultimate Team live services content in the quarter and if you have any outlook for the year. Are there any notable events that you\u2019ll be rolling out? And sorry if I missed it, but did you talk about Ultimate Team growth in the quarter? Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, we didn\u2019t call out Ultimate Team growth in the coming quarter, which we don\u2019t typically do. We just talked about Ultimate Team growth in last quarter, which year-over-year it was up 30%. The team has done an amazing job across all sports to find ways to continue to innovate and add new events. And that\u2019s what\u2019s always drives, brings people in to Ultimate Team and drives people to play Ultimate Team and we\u2019ve gotten better and better that over the life of the product and we\u2019ll continue to do that and we have optimism for the coming year and many years to come around all the sports Ultimate Teams because we will continue to innovate on those and look for new ways for people to play them. Michael Ng : Great, thank you, Blake. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario Lu : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I have one on Apex and one on Battlefield. So, the first one on Apex. I know it\u2019s only been a week since the launch, but can you comment on how the second permanent mode arena is performing versus your expectations. And do you expect this mode to kind of bring in more new players or just increasing the engagement of existing? Andrew Wilson : It\u2019s still too early to tell in terms of macro numbers, other than the demand was pretty incredible. First, we can add to the point where we had a few stability issues in the community, we're able to resolve those very quickly just the nature of demand was so extraordinary. In terms of do we expect that just to engage more existing players are bringing new players? I think, we believe both of those things will happen. What you have seen from the Apex team each and every season whether it\u2019s launching new maps, new characters or new modalities of play, every season has grown both players and the engagement of the existing player base and the player investment that comes from those two things. And so, it\u2019s still early to tell. I\u2019m going to say Season 8 is the biggest since Season 1 in 2019 and Season 9 as of right now looks like it will be bigger than Season 8 meaningfully so. And we\u2019re very excited about what these new modes will do. And you should expect many more new modes from Apex over the coming years. Mario Lu : Okay, thanks. And then the one on Battlefield, the new mobile title that\u2019s coming in late fiscal 2022, I believe it\u2019s developed by Industrial Toys. So can you provide some background on how you decided to choose that studio versus partnering with one of the Chinese companies like Tencent or NetEase. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Great question. Industrial Toys, we acquired some number of years ago now. It\u2019s led by the original team who helped to create Halo as a franchise and then it'd gone on to work in a number kind of mobile companies. And we're really committed to building a truly innovative experience around first-person shooter mechanics. When we met the team, we just feel that an incredible team. They had really unbelievable design ideas. And when we talked with them about the opportunity to work on Battlefield, they were as excited as we were. And so, we brought that team and the company a while ago now. They\u2019ve been working a number of the \u2013 a number of years through a number of cycles. And we got to a place where we\u2019re really very excited about the mechanics. It\u2019s a different kind of shooting mechanic to our Apex Legends. We believe they will speak with two very different markets both which have tremendous upside and tremendous opportunity for us and both games are coming from really talented studios. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company. Mike Hickey : Hi, Andrew, Blake. Congrats on the quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, again on Battlefield here, if you're seeing opportunity to annualize the premium experience, obviously, you've done well with that in sports. And prior Battlefield, I think, you had some experience with the Battle Royale. I am curious if that\u2019s still a consideration for the year and for the franchise moving forward. Andrew Wilson : Nothing to announce at the moment on either an annualized Battlefield and/or the nature of the modes in the upcoming Battlefield game, we\u2019re going to talk about a lot around that in the months to come starting next month with our reveal trailer, which I have a chance of seeing the work in progress last week and it is incredible. What the team has been able to do in the context of next-generation consoles and epic scale battles, unbelievable player accounts, destruction in terms of those which is really incredible, and it\u2019s a very innovative and creative mode for the future of the franchise. The other thing that you should know and I talked about in the prepared remarks is we do have a blueprint, which is how do we start with our AAA premium experience that is truly innovative in its category, how do we build out live service for long-term engagement and then how do we think about modalities at play and business models to further extend our reach and penetration of that game on a global basis across platforms, across geographies, across business models. And so you\u2019ll hear a lot more from us in the months ahead, but I would just \u2013 I would finish by saying we're really excited about Battlefield, everything I\u2019ve seen in the game is spectacular. And I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing relaunch of that franchise this year and will lead us into an incredible live service for the future. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, Mike you know that we do believe that won't give the Battlefield fans many ways to play and let them play for a long time. And I think you\u2019ll see that and what we\u2019ll talk about in the future, it is an opportunity to extend the Battlefield experience for people because it is such an engaged community. I\u2019d love to tell you what I said when I saw the trailer last week, but I would \u2013 I can\u2019t because it would get censored, but it\u2019s just to emphasize Andrew\u2019s point, I think people are going to be really blown away. And I\u2019ll tell you on gen-five, it is even more spectacular, but it will be great on either console, but it\u2019s going to be very exciting, I think. Mike Hickey : Nice, excited to play in. Last question for me, I think last call you noted that development of Battlefield is ahead of expectations, obviously you\u2019ve seen it exciting, maybe buzz building, but at the same time it looks like we view Criterion that studio to do additional work with the base. And I am just curious on the decision to do that and what your plans are for Need for Speed in the future? Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes, there are two things at play here. One is we have incredible ambition around Battlefield. We\u2019ve got DICE Stockholm, DICE LA, at Criterion our technology team in Gothenburg. And our entire Frostbite team, quite honestly, focused on making this the best possible Battlefield it can be. We've made tremendous progress. The teams have unbelievable ambition to be truly creative and innovative experience. And having Criterion who have delivered some of the most amazing experiences in our history and have worked really closely with DICE in the past come together to help realize the fullness of that ambition, which is the no brainer for us this year. What has also happened, of course, as we had acquired Codemasters and a number of new racing games, including the F1 franchise, which is shaping up to be really strong this year. And it was an opportunity for us to really think more broadly about our holistic racing strategy. Need for Speed will absolutely be a meaningful part of our future. We actually think there is with the combination of EA and Codemasters, we can actually expand and extend and enhance an interesting franchise, but those two things together meant that having Criterion work on Battlefield this year was absolutely the right choice for us. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, Mike, you know that Criterion actually delivered much \u2013 associated with \u2013 or flying associated with Battlefront I and Battlefront II. They\u2019ve worked very closely with DICE for a long time. And they are experts in driving, flying the things that are really hard to do. And so, it\u2019s not the first time that we pulled them into projects and they love it. They love to be able and we\u2019ve tried to create a culture where people want to work together. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here versus some other idea that well something must be wrong. No, no. This is an opportunity to put talent in at the right time and we always are measuring how that might impact future schedules. But as Andrew said, with the addition of Codemasters, we have a plethora of driving game opportunities right now that we can go after. And Criterion will continue to work on those going forward. Mike Hickey : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel. Drew Crum : Okay, thanks. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to discuss the pipeline for Glu and what\u2019s contemplated in fiscal 2022 net bookings guidance. They've previously planned to release a new Deer Hunter game and Table & Taste? And then separately, Blake, I think you mentioned some one-time expenses related to the Codemasters and Glu acquisitions. Are those cash or non-cash? And is it embedded in the 17% [ph] non-GAAP EPS growth that you\u2019re forecasting? And if not, what\u2019s the disconnect between that and the 18% net bookings growth that you\u2019re forecasting? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. We basically took their forecast that we used when we did the acquisition, which were fairly consistent with what they had done in the past. We didn\u2019t want to \u2013 we wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t over inflate those. We wanted to make sure we were pretty consistent with how they have talked about there for past. So you should assume they\u2019re pretty similar to what you\u2019ve seen historically. In terms of the one-time costs, they are cash costs. They are \u2013 in most cases, there might be some tax or R&D capitalization that occurs that will go into our P&L. But at the end of the day, the core cost in OpEx or things like deal fees, legal fees, closing fees, integration fees and those impact mainly the first quarter and not the full year. But there will be longer term on our GAAP EPS. There will be some accounting for acquisitions that are collection of buying in of IP, which is a positive right because they have great IP. So the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition and some one-time cash tax charges that may impact cash taxes and the cash flow. The other two that I mentioned was most likely will not impact cash flow. So but we wanted to make sure we were transparent about that. I would not worry about it because I think we will be able to continue to grow these businesses and generate higher returns off for businesses than they have in the past. And as I said, we did not put into our forecast any of the synergies associated with those acquisitions yet. More to come on that in the couple of \u2013 next couple of quarters. Just we literally just closed Glu what a few weeks ago and Codemasters a month ago. So we\u2019re just getting to a point where we truly understand what the integrations are going to look like, what cash and non-cash charges will look like, we will keep everyone informed. I would say it is not a big swing in the year on a non-GAAP side. It\u2019s only a swing on a GAAP EPS side, just because the way the accounting works for acquisition. Drew Crum : Okay. Thanks, Blake. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hi, thanks gentlemen, just two quick ones. The first one, how should we read into EA Play moving into July from June? Lots of reasons why that could be move back, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that in the future of marketing for your titles. And then secondly, it sounds like Battlefield and your future for sports franchises are really trying to take advantage of next-gen consoles. How should we think about obviously some games that have tried doing that struggled on previous consoles were being too ambitious. How should we think about those titles relative to the two different generation of consoles? Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes, on EA Play, I think that typically E3 govern the key promotional timeframe across most of the industry happened in June given COVID and virtual marketing and the nature of these things. I think we\u2019ve been able to kind of thinking about what\u2019s the most appropriate time line for us and given the launch schedules at our guidance we feel like July is the right time frame from that, but what I\u2019d also say is as we talked about. You\u2019ll hear a lot from us \u2013 in June and we'll kind of ramp up after that July. So it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t hear anything inform us until July. The July timeframe just optimally time for our title launches better suits us. We\u2019ve showed up in June in the past because the whole industry has at that time, while with the world that we live in now we have greater flexibility to do what\u2019s more relevant for our business. With respect to the current generation versus next generation titles or maybe we should say current generation versus past generation platform titles, I mean this is we have done exceptionally well for decades. I had a great fortunate growing up in this company and building games on multiple generations. And I think when you think about our infrastructure around our Frostbite team, our digital services teams and our game teams who have unbelievable experience getting the very best out of the past generation consoles to ensure that even as we move to the next generation, we\u2019re getting more and more out of the old generation platforms. And so those games are going to look great. When we think about new platform generations, again with the advances that we\u2019re making in Frostbite with the advances that we\u2019re making in our digital ecosystem and with the advances that we\u2019re making at a future design level with the new unlocks that come from power, the gains on next generation consoles are going to be extraordinary. And then we\u2019ve already launched FIFA and Madden on those platforms. And so, we\u2019re going into year two of those and we gain a lot of learning with our other franchises as we move into the second year of the platform. Andrew Uerkwitz : Awesome, thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, the only other thing I would add to that is remember if our business is approaching 70% plus live services what is critical is getting people into a franchise because once they are in a franchise or in a social network with other people that love the same thing they do and that means they will engage in the live service, which means they\u2019re going to stay longer, they may spend, but most importantly it becomes something that they do for a long time, because it is that network that holds them together. If you love football, you want to engage in football with all the people that love the same thing you do, the same team, the same league, whatever it might be. So a part of the logic around building out the subscription platform on multiple vehicles is making sure we\u2019re continuing to bring people to live services, which we know people will love over time to play. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Matthew Thornton : Hi, Andrew. Hi, Blake. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of quick ones from me. First on Apex, you talked about, obviously, layering in mobile growth. I guess if we think about just the base game this year, do you expect growth in the base game maybe just driven by the full year of the launch on Apex, any color there. Secondly, as it relates to Battlefield, I don\u2019t know if you can maybe give us any context as to how you\u2019re thinking about that in the fiscal 2022 guidance, maybe relative to prior precedent for the game, again any color there. And then just lastly, I\u2019m not sure if you'd be willing to buy it, but on any developments or progress you\u2019d be willing to talk about as it relates to maybe the out-year pipeline in several of the titles that you\u2019ve disclosed and discussed in the past. Thanks guys. Blake Jorgensen : Well, I\u2019ll start. What I would say is in our guidance we're traditionally conservative. So in our guidance for Battlefield, we have a lot of expectations, a lot of excitement, but I would tell you, we don\u2019t have a number that is unachievable there. I think we clearly can achieve it and we hope to exceed it because we know that the Battlefield title is going to be very strong. Apex we\u2019ve seen growth year or quarter-over-quarter basically since it started and we have high confidence that the team can continue to do that even before the mobile product comes out and mobile obviously will accelerate that. And I think, as we said earlier, we don\u2019t have a giant number in there for mobile this year because we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when it goes live and monetizes. So, I think, we \u2013 if you look at our forecast, it\u2019s a large forecast, probably the biggest than we\u2019ve ever done, but I would say there is still conservatism in that forecast around both mobile, Battlefield and other titles where we are all focused on trying to grow. I can\u2019t remember what's your third question was, so apologize. Matthew Thornton : It was around out year content and what do we buy from that? Andrew Wilson : So what I would offer is I think that what we talked about earlier was we have been recruiting amazing talent into the organization from across the industry and we feel really, really good about our better strength both in the context of mobile and the context of our HD organization and you\u2019ve also seen us growing in really good ways in Asia. We\u2019ve talked about a college football game, we\u2019ve talked about a skate game, we\u2019ve talked about a new game from Motive, we talked about new game \u2013 Apex. We\u2019ve talked about a number of new FIFA titles from our mobile group and new mobile titles in Asia. I would tell you that we still feel really good and really strong about all of those that are tracking as we believe they had including a new title coming out of BioWare. So nothing new to give you beyond that other than we still feel very confident in our outgoing or out-year portfolio. And we also have some other things that we are kind of incubating that we think will further add to them in the year to come. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Todd Juenger : Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Appreciate you squeezing me here at the end, which is perfect for this question, I think, I guess I\u2019m struck having been sitting here listening that the issue how consumers will behave as we move through this next year and beyond has barely been discussed, especially given the fact that you\u2019re in a position on the calendar where you\u2019re giving us thank you for \u2013 for a year forward. So I guess I just wanted to visit that briefly in just given everything you\u2019ve observed and learned during this \u2013 have you \u2013 do you wanted to share with us what your underlying assumptions are in your guidance for however consumers are going to change their lives as we move through this? And have you basically concluded that it doesn\u2019t matter that much to your own success? Or how should we be thinking about that? I appreciate it. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, we \u2013 go ahead, sorry Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Sorry. I\u2019ll let Blake kind of get some sort of things around these, but I would say pre-pandemic, we had seen two fundamental secular trends, social interaction was moving from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment was moving from linear to interactive. So that was already happening. What happened through COVID was those two secular trends were accelerated exponentially and we sold almost all interaction happen digitally and almost all consumption of sport and much of entertainment was done to [indiscernible]. As we project forward, we don\u2019t see that going backwards in any meaningful way. In fact, we think it will continue to grow stronger as we\u2019ve really established social networks inside out of our games and inside of our network. And we're really offering players I mean in a more way to connect with the sports and leads and teams and entertainment content may love. So we think that the growth of our business, we think that \u2013 we don\u2019t think anything ever goes back to where it was before. We think this growth continues. There will, of course, be some changes as various parts of the world moves through, the post-pandemic stages, but there is notion of social interaction moves from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment moving from linear to interactive. We don\u2019t think that goes back. And we think that underpinned and it\u2019s foundational to the ongoing strength of our business going forward. Blake Jorgensen : Yes, I just add to that. We obviously know that our Q1 last year was extremely strong, because that was when everyone essentially went home and many people even didn\u2019t work, right. So clearly, we benefited from that, but if you look at Q2 through Q4 of last year, what you saw is still strength not strength of Q1 but still strength every quarter, beating guidance every quarter, unbelievable strength across Ultimate Team, Apex and others. And to Andrew\u2019s point we were able to steer people into games and social networks that were very \u2013 for them, and they stayed around. And we\u2019re seeing that trend going forward. And even if we all go back because maybe someday normal life, which we all hope, we believe we brought a lot of new people into games and into social networks that they want to be in and they enjoy being in and we\u2019ll continue to plan. So we \u2013 no one quite knows how to predict COVID going forward, but we\u2019re very confident that we have done something that we never anticipated at the start of last year, but it is work to our advantage to bring people into games that they love and networks that they love. And we think that will help us long-term. Blake Jorgensen : So with that, I think that was our last question. We appreciate everybody\u2019s constant attention and help and look forward to seeing people hopefully in-person one day, but if not, by Zoom. So, thank you for everybody taking your time today. Andrew Wilson : Thank you all. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q1 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Christina. Welcome to EA's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today from their homes are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we'll post our prepared remarks and audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q2 fiscal 2022 earnings call is scheduled for Wednesday, November 3. And as a reminder, we posted schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation includes - and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today, and Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, August 4, 2021, and disclaims any duty to update it. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year than is otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EAPlay-live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Blue Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content. Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and life services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever. Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities : the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content, the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers : building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile. EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, which FUT matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever. We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers. Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new hyper motion technology powered innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; an EA SPORTS PGA Tour, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, the Masters at Augusta National, the Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship and the PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future. With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect. Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest play accounts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise. During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulative generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record leadership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community. More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching ears, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer. There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP. Our third growth driver is live services, our core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG lifestyle and racing. Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broad audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy. Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion. Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster - by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside. Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago. We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Gul Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball, and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team leveraged by our global commercial operation. We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042. Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations. Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying, profit and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion, with capital expenditures remaining around $250 million. That would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. Our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He's interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worn for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for an amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost, Andrew? Andrew Wilson : Sorry. Minor glitch. Thank you, Blake. I'd like to echo your thoughts and sentiments and say thank you, Ken, for all of your outstanding contributions to Electronic Arts. We'll miss you. As I started this call, I again want to thank our teams for everything they continue to do in service of our players around the world. Thanks to their efforts, we're bringing hundreds of millions of players together through our games and live services like Apex Legends. We're delivering great new experiences like F1 2021 and Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and we have even more amazing content to come. It's been a strong start to our fiscal year. Our growth drivers, leadership in sports, building blockbuster franchises and growing live services, including mobile, are accelerating our business, and we're well positioned for continued growth this year and beyond. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Printers. Eric Handler : The first question, real quickly with F1. I wonder if you could compare how marketing for the game has changed on a year-over-year basis. And then I've got a follow-up to that. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I would tell you, I just think that when you think about how we go to market with our games, we have global reach. We have extraordinarily digital capabilities and kind of data-driven marketing processes that allows us to better target both existing players, lapsed players and potential new players. And I think what we've been able to do as an organization is take that strength, partner that with an extraordinary game team at Codemasters and what is also a spectacular game in the middle of an F1 season that is more interesting than any season in recent history with the competition between Hamilton and Verstappen kind of hotting up. And the combination of all those things together has meant that we've seen growth in the franchise and expect to continue to grow that franchise over time. Eric Handler : Great. And then I assume - should we assume this year there's going to be live services for F1? And was there any consequential live services with last year game? Andrew Wilson : It would - this game is early in the partnership between Codemasters and EA SPORTS. So a lot of how we think about the future live service of that business and sustaining that community and that fan base and play base over time is going to continue to evolve. There is some this year but not as extensive as certainly we think we will get to over the course of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Andrew Marok : Blake, I know you want to briefly mention it, but I want to see if you could go into a bit more color. Typically, you don't kind of give plus 1 year guidance out or - so when you're thinking about growing mid-double digits for next fiscal year, could you give us any color on how that's going to be achieved? Is it more of the same? But any additional color to help us kind of piece together how we should think about that growth rate. Blake Jorgensen : Sorry. I was on mute. Sorry about that. So what I was saying is, first and foremost, focus on the acquisitions that we've done. And those, on their own, will create substantial uptick in both top line growth and bottom line growth as we look at continuing to fuel those acquisitions and then use those talent bases to start to build out new titles that we can add to our overall portfolio. Second, think about Apex Mobile. We've said that we have very little in this year. We're in test market, and we should be out in the global markets in China next year, if not earlier. That could be a huge driver in profitability going forward. We have the potential of live services around Battlefield as well as a Battlefield mobile game coming up. And we clearly have other games planned, such as a Need for Speed or others that are coming, which you'll hear more about in the future. But you can imagine. We try to operate the business on a 5-year cadence if not longer, and we're thinking about how do we generate growth each year, both organic and through acquisitions. And I would tell you I think we are in a better position than we've ever seen before. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. I appreciate that, considering it's so far out. The next question - and I'll bring it back to current times. Could you walk us through the pushes and takes of how we should think about the impact FIFA has on this quarter versus what it will have on the December quarter considering the shift in launch date? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. So I know not everyone on the street has seen this, and it's not clear for a lot of people. We'll ship FIFA on technically October 1, which means we actually ship it a little earlier for people who are part of our subscription program, for example. But we will capture some revenue, as we've shown in our guidance for this quarter in Q2. we'll also capture revenue in Q3. And usually, the first 1 to 2 quarters of FIFA are the biggest quarters because people are building their ultimate teams. And so we'll see strong growth both this quarter and next quarter off of FIFA with the shift being that it's dropping in Q2, which last year, it only dropped in Q3 when we started it, but it should make a huge difference. And for the full year, obviously, we wouldn't have generated - or said that we were going to grow for a full year and increase our guidance if we weren't confident about FIFA as well as other products. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft : Was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the Dead Space franchise and what you guys are expecting from the reboot there. And secondly then, on the name image likeness development? And maybe to what extent do you think including realized college athletes is something that you guys are focused on. And from a development perspective, how quickly could you add that to one of your games versus using generic players? Andrew Wilson : Two great questions. Having just provided a very small trailer on Dead Space, there's - or a sweet preview on Dead Space, there's no lot more I can share about that. It's a little ways out yet, but the studio has taken it on. What I can say is it's one of the great games from our catalog there has been extraordinary demand to bring it back for existing players and next generation of players, and we're excited to kind of add that to the portfolio over time. And we'll be able to share more as development continues. But I would just - I would close on that point by saying it was one of the most demanded titles for us, maybe just after Skate, which we've also announced we're bringing back, and the response was very positive to the announcement that we're back in development. Around name image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of naming and lightness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around an image likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name image and lightness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context. And we are building the architecture of the game with a database structure so that if and when that comes online, we'll be able to add back to the game very seamlessly. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Unidentified Analyst : Great quarter, guys. Awesome. Blake, that was exciting to see. Two questions. First 1 on FIFA Ultimate Team, look like in the quarter, maybe subsequent, you tested some 3D packs, which was sort of an alternative to loop boxes. So just curious of your learnings there from that test event. And the second question, just looking at the competitive landscape on FIFA. It looks like you shifted to football free to play? So just curious how you're thinking about how that sort of changed in the competitive environment. Andrew Wilson : Yes, two great questions. On preview packs, the short answer is it was very well received by the community. Our FIFA Ultimate team are always working very closely with our community of players. FIFA Ultimate Team is the most played mode in that game by a wide margin. And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Premium pack, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer change names football and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around hypermotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet. And we believe we have the best team to do that, and we'll look to continue to do that over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Matthew Thornton : Maybe two, if I could, and these are actually things you hit on in earlier questions. I guess just coming back to, Blake, on the commentary for next year, I'm just curious if that guidance is dependent on any big, frontline title. Obviously, this year, you've got Battlefield. I'm curious if that's dependent on any larger title for next year. Somewhat relatedly, I'm curious thoughts around Battlefield. Does that franchise still aspire to be in every other year release type of a cadence in a normal world? Just curious if there have any updated thoughts there. And then just finally around some of the collegiate sports given some of the changes going on there, I'm curious if there's any interest around basketball with NBA Live, a little bit dormant here. I'm wondering if there's any pivot in any interest there? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. All good questions. I would say next year - and this is a testament to our business. Next year is a collection of great franchises all coming to play and new franchises. So new franchises in mobile, new franchises across our business, in places like F1 and other driving games and new franchises or existing franchises that we will bring back that - like NCAA or PGA Golf that we've talked about. And you know what? We've always tried to build the business on a collection of great titles, not one title because one title always poses risk. And so our view is a collection of the titles with great live services associated with them - and you're going to see that over the next - not just next year but for the next many years to come. That's how we've tried to build our business. And I think you'll hear more about it. We're not trying to give guidance right now on next year. But we did say in our prepared remarks that we're confident of growth going forward even after an incredible growth there this year and last year. And we feel like we're on a really good path to continue to try to grow this business, and we're seeing the great reception for our products in the marketplace. So more to come on that. We'll give you guys more details as we get closer. We know that's what you want. But you should just trust that we're confident that we're seeing and we're planning both top line and bottom line growth going forward. And now I don't remember your next two questions. Andrew Wilson : Let me jump in. On do we think Battlefield will return to an every other year launch, I would say - I think that is our orientation. But more importantly, I think you should think about Battlefield as a service what we announced - what we're doing for the launch of this game is really revolutionizing and reinventing what - all our epic scale warfare is in the context of gameplay. In addition to that, we've heard us announce Battlefield Portal, which really starts to lean into user-generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game. And while we've announced Hazard Zone is a name we have to disclose a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free to anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while - and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on. Then I think your - the other part of your question was naming lightness college sports and does that open up an opportunity on basketball. I would tell you our focus right now is football. But what you've also heard us talk about is really building on our strength in sports. We believe this is a unique strength for us. We're the leading company when it comes to delivering multiple high-quality sports across - at global scale, and it would not be a match for us in a world where we start to develop more into college football to start expand that to other college sports as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Mario Lu : First one is on Battlefield. So you mentioned you're not updating your unit sales estimate for the title for - deposit response to sales. So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on in terms of in-app purchases with an upcoming title. How should we frame the opportunity with that new monetization channel as historically with monetized with CSD? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. What I would say is that don't take our comments on not updating the guidance on Battlefield in any way as a negative. It is - we ultimately expose the world to Battlefield later than we normally would do. Normally, we do it through early June, E3 or maybe even earlier than that, and we did it in early July. So we're trying to make sure we pace the disclosure about what's in the game to people and then measure our demand off of that. But we're feeling very, very positive about it. And we wouldn't have raised our full year guidance if we didn't feel that was a potential for us, and I think it's an upside for the company longer term during the year. You're going to hear a lot more over the next couple of months about Battlefield live services, in-game monetization and so forth. I can't tell you all that now, but trust that the team is working very hard on this, and they have some very unique ideas about what we can continue to do, what Andrew just said, to create this as a long-term interaction with our consumers versus simply selling a game this year. And we want to build a long-term relationship as we have with Battlefield users for a long time. Portal is a perfect example of how that works, and you'll see more of that and more details about that over the next couple of months. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks, Blake. And just one on mobile. In terms of the acquisition of Playdemic, that makes a lot of strategic spend given that you're building down in support. Can you talk about just the near- and long-term synergies we should expect from this acquisition? Blake Jorgensen : Well, I would say with all of our acquisitions that we've done - we've done 4 now if you include Playdemic, which is not yet closed, you're going to see clearly some synergies, synergies in terms of management teams, synergies in terms of go-to-market strategies, marketing strategies and so forth. Most of these companies are smaller. They are exceptional in how they develop games. But as you've seen with F1 already, we've been able to drive more sales than what we've seen historically with that business, and we'll continue to do that across all of the portfolio of companies. I would say in the case of Playdemic and in the case of Glu, Tap Sports Baseball and Metalhead with their baseball game and Playdemic's golf game, we are going to leverage their strengths as best as possible to try to find ways to create more and better casual games in mobile - on mobile than we have in the past. And that's not to say that we haven't done a good job on mobile. We have, but the potential that we have - if you look at what Playdemic's done, the potential we have with something like a global FIFA game or a global Madden game where we already have the licenses, there is huge upside. I can't give you what those numbers look like yet. But I will tell you that the reason we did these deals was to try to make sure we brought the talent in that could help us expand our capabilities on more casual sports games around the globe and more casual games in general around the globe. And we're pretty excited about it. And I'd tell you, the mobile teams have worked very closely with the new teams at Playdemic or Glu or Metalhead or Codemasters, and they've come up with some amazing ideas on what we could do together. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jamie Bass with Berenberg. Unidentified Analyst : Two questions from me, please. Firstly, it looks like engagement is still holding up very well. But are you seeing any sort of different trends in markets where restrictions eased more versus markets where there's still more a lockdown at the moment? And then secondly, with the F1 game, that looks like it's been very well received through reviews and everything. Is that so far going in terms of sales and engagement? Is that going broadly how you expected it? Or is there any outperformance versus your internal expectations? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would say just on the F1 game, I think we've exceeded our expectations. There's no negative on the F1 team because they are exceptional. it was could we quickly - I mean we didn't own the business for that long. So could we quickly integrate the teams, our marketing and publishing efforts to try and drive that business as fast as we did? That's probably where we might have had some questions. And actually, we've well exceeded that - And it's to the testament of an exceptional game development team that was able to produce the right assets, to produce the right marketing materials to help us drive this business and the teams working together. And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions, we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn as obviously driven the amazing development of Apex, but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now - it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day, it is amazing what our teams are able to do. I would tell you, to your earlier part of the question, we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired, and it doesn't - it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that, and you have to have great products to do that. And so I would tell you that the combination of great teams and great marketers is really powerful in this industry, and I think we've been able to prove that we can do that across all the acquisitions that we've done in the last 4 or 5 years. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And I would jump in. On your point around restrictions and are we seeing anything different, I would tell you given the rollercoaster nature of opening up and shutting down and lockdowns and various restrictions that are happening in various geographies and territories globally, it's almost hard to track at this juncture who is open and who is closed. What I would tell you though in aggregate is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to. And as we think about building ongoing interactive entertainment experiences, this is why you hear us leading into the social ecosystems in and around our games because this is what drives longevity and it's what drives deepening engagement in our business. And so I think what we're seeing right now is the world is in different phases in different places. But on aggregate, engagement in and around our games continues to be extremely strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Cost : It's Matt on for Brian. Two, if I could. So just on the strength of Apex in the quarter, obviously, the comp was extremely hard. So that's a pretty impressive feat. Are there any specific initiatives or pieces of content or geographies that you would call out that have sort of been the source of that outperformance year-on-year for Apex. And then just secondly, on the mobile side, we've heard from some peers in the mobile gaming space that they've seen very little impact to their ROI on advertising after the recent changes to app tracking on iOS and other that they've seen sort of an increase in UA spend being necessary? I'm wondering what experience you guys are having on the mobile side there. Andrew Wilson : Let me jump in on Apex and then maybe Blake could hit the kind of the mobile ad piece. The only thing I would tell you is it's not just any one thing. I think what I talked about in my prepared remarks is the very detailed nature that the Respawn team and the Apex team takes the ongoing development of this experience and the support of the growing global communities. And it's really about - on any given day, it's really thinking about what enhancement, extensions, innovations they can add to core gameplay, that moment-to-moment gameplay. There is - how can they think about new modalities of play like arenas, which changes kind of the broader rule set of how you engage in that moment to moment gameplay. And how do they add content with the legend and with all of those - the extra stuff in and around that, that drives more interest. And I think what we're seeing now is that team really started to deeply understand using data and using a close relationship they have with the community, continue to enhance gameplay, continue to add modalities of play and continue to double down on a really interesting, unique content that the community really gravitates towards. And I think as you think about that in the context, we're now taking that new geographies and new platforms. This is why we're so confident in the ongoing strength of that franchise. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. And what I would say on the advertising side is right or wrong, we've never had a large advertising business. It covers around $100 million a year. Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile, it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave your network to go play somewhere else. We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising, and we may change our views over time. We think it's important - in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road if that's where we want to go. And more to come on that. We're just - we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules, new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising for you to play a world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game. And we'll see how that plays out over time. Andrew Wilson : Yes. The one thing I would add there is while it hasn't been a giant business for us, what we have seen as Glu has kind of joined us is they actually have been significantly better at monetizing through advertising than we have been. They come with some really strong underlying technology. They come with really strong underlying expertise. And our sense is while it's still early, our sense is the combination of that technology, that expertise, our broader base of portfolio and the global reach it has likely means there's upside opportunity for us even in today's world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Gerrick Johnson : So last quarter, you said that guidance did not include potential synergies from Glu and Codemasters, and now you've had 3 months to integrate. It sounds like you've identified some F1, for instance, not just cost synergies but some revenue synergies there. So your guidance, you increased about 1 quarter beat and then $0.01. So what synergies have you identified? And are they now included in your guidance? Blake Jorgensen : So no cost synergies are included in our guidance. Clearly, revenue synergies are occurring as they occur. As you pointed out, we did better at F1 than we thought we would. Those are harder to predict. But we haven't yet implanted cost synergies in our OpEx line. For example, changes in executives, changes in staffing, changes - either positive or negative. You should assume that there are going to be some changes, and we will layer those into guidance over the next 3 to 6 months. We've been very focused on making sure we're bringing the company in as successful as possible and then determining what is the right way to drive synergies. But I would tell you is - there are potential large synergies across all of the acquisitions we've made, which would normally happen, but we'll see more of those over the next few quarters, and we'll try to keep everyone appraised of that. Gerrick Johnson : Okay. Great. And last year, when you launched your sports games. There were cardboard cutouts in the stands. This year, we're going to have full stands with fans and stands. How much of a lift do you think it provides your games with sports actually happening and people in the stands? Blake Jorgensen : Well, I'll pull Andrew to answer that, but I hope we actually get to real people in the stands because we might go the other way right now. So who knows? Andrew Wilson : That was going to be my point. It's hard to understand exactly where the world is going to go. I think it's unlikely that we have events without fans in the stadiums, and we may just see some protocols around masks and/or testing and/or vaccination. But our whole sports fans is that we get fans back in stadiums. I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the forms of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games. So net-net, notwithstanding any further challenges around the pandemic, it's almost certainly a positive for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Andrew Marok : I wanted to drill down a bit on Ultimate Team. And is there anything to call out there maybe on newer players that have come into the ecosystem over the last 12 to 18 months? How is that cohort's behavior compared to more established cohorts? And has there been any notable difference in newer player behavior from things like reopening? Blake Jorgensen : Yes. I would say that we always have newer players come in as the game grows. Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of ultimate teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working for home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And just some little detail I would add in there. Again, when we think about Ultimate Team, it's a long-term balanced way to connect your friends in and around the sport. And it has become that and it's certainly the most played mode in FIFA and very strong in lot of franchises. As we think about this, 2/3 of people who play Ultimate Team don't actually buy packs and only 9 out of 10 packs are opened with earned coins. And so we're always trying to ensure that constant balance of engagement and enjoyment of our player community. And what we saw with premium packs was we saw a higher incidence of new players coming in Ultimate Team and we saw high conversion of those new players in and around buying packs and participating in the digital ecosystem. So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and premium packs is one of those examples. Blake Jorgensen : Chris, we got time for one more question? Or is that it? Chris Evenden : No, I think that's it. So if you just want to close the call now or at time put me out. Blake Jorgensen : Well, thank you everybody for your interest and good questions, and we look forward to interacting with you over the next couple of months. And hopefully, we all get to see each other in person one of these days soon. So - but I appreciate it. Andrew Wilson : Thank you all. Stay well. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic who are now officially part about Electronic Ops team. We're thrilled to have them on board adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We're growing with our leading franchises, new launches, and large services all performing well during the quarter and our acquisition are driving additional growth beyond our core business. With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we're connecting players all over the world to each other, to a more about favorite content.  As a result, net revenue, net bookings, and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we're now raising our full-year net revenue, net bookings, and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year. Our core strategy is built on full key opportunities. The creation of amazing games and content. Tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences. The aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models, and geographies. And harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around down gains.  As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22, expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports, and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today. With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform rates, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA sports FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and The Sims, are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment. Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry. A brand-new IP that has scaled to more than a 100 million players and is closing in on a billion dollars in net bookings annually. Season 9 and season 10 introspectively set new marks for the highest active players of Season one.  And Q2 was the biggest quarter of income spending in Apex that we've had to date. Apex is growing beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than a $130 million hours of season 10 content watched to-date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay. Embedded in an immersive world of law and characters that continues to expand. Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection event, keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode.  The Apex Legends eSports ecosystem is growing as well. With the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now on the way. Apex is moving from strength to strength. And we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year. Battlefield, another of our blockbuster properties in beloved by tens of millions of fans. Ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2043 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 open battle in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had.  This is an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small squad for the game in our open beta, we brought players into the full scale, 128 player combats, and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped out teams with areas of the game play to polish and refine as we move towards launch. We've now revealed all three of the game\u2019s pillars. [Indiscernible] 128 plan multi-play Income Quest and breakthrough modes. Battlefield portal, a new write-up play that has the community very excited to create their own Battlefield experiences and hazard zones with completely new squad focus combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love.  We're looking forward to play as getting to all of these experiences when the full battle for 233 game launches on November 19. Europe 0.22, we're continuing to grow our leadership in sports through new gains, acquisitions, and new areas of expansion. Our global football, or soccer for us in the North America franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world, with approximately a 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. EA Sports FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2, is off to the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation and our new Hot promotion technology revolutionized gameplay and has inspired, engaged in growing the community. Total players were up 16%, and [Indiscernible] franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch. With net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with Ultimate Team engagement up 15% year-over-year, and more players coming into Volta and career modes.  There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including Mobile, will later this fiscal year, will bring new modes, new features, and improved gameplay that FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience today. For nearly 30-years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world. Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport.  With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license part including the Premier League, UEFA, CONMEBOL, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A, the MLS, [Indiscernible], and many more. And our expertise in growth areas including e-sports and mobile. EA sports are ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world. We have opportunities of new modalities of play, and new social experiences that will bring more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around the game.  And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's league teams and clients. We are more confident than ever about our broad future football and we will grow our franchises leadership with our partners around the world. We are continually investing in innovation, creativity, and all benches to bring EA SPORTS games close to the heart of real-world sporting fans. Engagement in Madden NFL '22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refreshed Franchise Mode and Madden Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends.  We've grown the implementing business year-over-year as F1 2021 when Codemasters continues to bring in more players and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 [Indiscernible] in years. NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began. With a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. With a portfolio that now spend global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, golf, UFC Fighting, and racing. No other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams, and partners as EA SPORTS. We have a unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate [Indiscernible] enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.  Expanding a live service across our portfolio, particularly in mobile, is our third growth driver for FY 2022. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Gulf clash mobile games. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Gulf clash as a live service and bringing the clash mechanic to more of our sports franchises where our [Indiscernible] expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. Our EA Mobile teams also continue to derive success in launch services, including Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players last-to-date in Q2. Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic, and EA Mobile teams.  We have built a powerful mobile [Indiscernible] of organization within a year. This group is shortly for accelerating growth in our portfolio. More than 15 top mobile live services, as well as introducing new experiences that takeout powerful IP, including Battlefield in the expanding mobile audience. The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer, managing Company-wide operations, creative leaders joining our management team, and our new Chief Executive Officer leading our efforts to grow social ecosystems. All supporting our 19 games as we drive growth in the next year of interactive entertainment. Now, I will turn the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of play day at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable Mobile title and Butte trend for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever. And more than doubled the level of last year's. We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year.  EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle, with engagement in its last couple of months [Indiscernible] very significantly on FIFA 20. Keeping fans engaged, drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales, and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double-digits year-on-year based on the first three weeks of sales. Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collections of that this quarter, but even so the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life to-date, and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year. To launch an original IP and steadily building into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional. And I would like to recognize the respond team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base, and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of seasonal level. Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement or stand on our games as countries such as the UK emerged from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6% points from last year.  The strong digital mix for full game sales aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations. So now turning to guidance, we now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.848 billion, and earnings per share of $2.03 up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are raising our net bookings guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.625 billion.  This is driven by outperformance so far this year plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our Mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio. Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth, and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website.  We have also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion, with capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. As noted last quarter, capex is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environments and new offices around the globe. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion, cost of revenue, would be $625 million, and operating expenses of $1.1 billion.  This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3. We expect Q3 Financial 2022, net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted, included last year, the launch of FIFA21, that was the large quarter ever for Q3 of the Company's history. The games and live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year, and beyond. Now, I'll hand the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. The holiday quarter is always an exciting time. We're looking forward to delivering amazing entertainment and connecting hundreds of millions of players around the world through each other throughout games and live services in the months ahead. I'm going to take the opportunity here to say thank you again to our incredible teams at electronic apps. Their commitment to creativity and innovation in service applies is second to none. And every day it is inspiring to work alongside such talented and dedicated people. It's been a strong year to date, and we're confident in our plans to drive continued growth in the years ahead. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Operator : If you would like to ask a question at this time, please [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could provide us an update on your outlook for some of your new Mobile titles like Apex Legends and Battlefield, and then second, I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on the FIFA license, how aggressively will you negotiate for that, and what are some of the contingencies that you have planned for that one. Thank you. Blake Jorgensen : Let me start with Mobile and then I'll let Andrew answer the FIFA question. We have not put in to our guidance virtually any revenue for either Apex Mobile or Battlefield Mobile this year. Apex Mobile is currently in test in multiple countries around the world. And we never quite know exactly what we're going to get out of test markets, but we're very pleased with the progress so far, which means we could bring it out earlier, but I would say that most of it is really focused on next year, which we think is a positive since this year is so strong. It will continue to help next year. And I would put Battlefield in that same category. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And I would just cover up. The metrics that we're getting out of those games continues to be very strong. And so, we continue to be confident about the opportunity around both of them. And with respect to license negotiations, I would start by saying, we have great relations with all of our partners, all 300 of them, including FIFA. As we think about the future of football, we think the future is very bright. We are positive and very fabric of the cultural football globally and important part of fandom for football, and when we got to interact with hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities of play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, eSports, NFTs, broader sports consumption. And they want us to move really, really quickly. And so, I would tell you as we think about the future of football within is very bright, we're going to work with our global collection of partners that will still best enable us to do that. And we'll continue our conversations with each and every one of them to the extent that they are aligned with that objective. Mike Ng : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Blake. Operator : Next question is from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thanks [Indiscernible] I just have 2 questions for you. The first one is, how should we think about Apex Legends, live services, and maybe even a comment or 2 on Battlefield live services as we head through the holiday and into next year. Or is it just a matter of more content, better efficiency on monetization, or how should we think about live services there? Andrew Wilson : What I talked about in the prepared remarks is that the Apex Legends team has really been very thoughtful and deliberate about the development and the building of this live service and the community support since the very beginning. And it starts with core gameplay. And what we've seen them be out to do with bringing more players each and every season. And kind of our weekly active in our monthly active players is grown throughout the cycle so far. They add new models of play, to things like ranked mode and arenas.  They add new events that are important and more deeply engage the community. And so, I think that as we think about live service on a go forward basis, you should expect that thing to continue to be thoughtful and deliberate. They'll continue to build out modalities of play, they'll continue to create more content, but also really work with the community-on-community level in events which really drive the most engagement over time. And we continue to be very confident this is going to be a really, really strong global franchise for us for at least a decade. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. And then just a second question, Andrew, just high level, you're pretty forward-thinking CEO when it comes to technology. How do you see things like play-to - earn opportunities within the video games space? There seems to be a bit of an argument on whether that's good or bad for gaming. Andrew Wilson : Anything that brings more people in and engages those people for more time in a context with the extent that I think it's a good thing over time. I think that is the very foundation of our live services. I think the play-to-earn or the NFC conversation is still really, really early. And there's a lot of conversation and is at some level a lot of hype about it. I do think it will be an important part about the future of our industry on a go-forward basis. But it's still early to figure out how that's going to work. I feel good about our position with respect to that.  I mean, as a Company, we have been leaders in the creation of digital content that has real collectible value in the embedding of that content as part of large services and what we know about collection over time is that collectability is far more valuable to the collector, where the collected item has utility. And I think that in the context of the games that we create and the live services that we offer, Collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future. So still early to tell, but I think we're in a really good position and you should expect us to think more innovatively and creatively about that on a go-forward basis. Andrew Uerkwitz : Awesome. Thank you so much guys. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen. Doug Creutz : Hey, thanks. In your commentary, you alluded to some softness in the mobile market. I [Indiscernible] if could you just talk a little bit more about what you've seen, some of what your peers have important numbers that would suggest there was some sequential softening in the market. Do you think it's done the IDFA? Do you think there's different dynamics and playing with pandemic restrictions, easing in mobile versus console? Any color you can give would be helpful. Andrew Wilson : I think when we -- sorry. Blake Jorgensen : Sorry go ahead. Andrew. Go ahead. No, you can go ahead. Andrew Wilson : I was going to say I think that when we look at across our mobile portfolio, we feel like we're in a really good position on a go-forward basis. We've got strong teams, got a strong IP, we've got a huge network of players, and we've got global reach. And we're already seeing the value of that when you think about our ability to offer EA IP for Glu Mobile folks, or our Playdemic folks to start thinking about new and interesting experiences.  I didn't think we've seen some softness in some of our games, particularly those that rely a little bit more needs acquisition. I think that will work through that over time. Again, creative talent, great IP, huge network applies in global reach allowance work through that and find a path through that. But net-net, I think that there is a little idea phase. But nothing that has us concerned about our ability to continue to grow our Mobile business overtime. Blake Jorgensen : And [Indiscernible], I would say don't underestimate that in any -- I mean, we did 4 acquisitions in one year. There are always challenges to integration of acquisitions and sometimes those challenges are done we changed plans inside the businesses. There are things that we may not have anticipated or fully understood. And so, some of that is impacting -- none of it is troublesome, none of it is long term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration it just happened also quickly. You can't plan on exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.  And we're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position and I think for us the biggest opportunity is, and this is an obvious one and that is, how do we take our existing sports licensors and the talent that the Glu's and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through that talent base and -- or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us, obviously in FIFA, but also in Madden and PGA and other areas where we can either augment their games, add to their games, or add new games. And so that's why we're so excited about the acquisitions and not all that worried about any short-term softness in the business. Doug Creutz : Very helpful. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Your next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Mr. David: Thank you. This is David on for Alexia. Just with Battlefield. Maybe you could discuss the key learnings from the data. How much should we read into participation for the early access period of indicator of demand. And I wonder if you just had a comment on the risk of if any, of releasing the game a week part of Black Friday? I think this was somewhat of a challenge for the game in 2018. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. So, I think that on balance, the feedback from the beta was overwhelmingly positive. There were some conversations around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural innovator. And we will be able to take that feedback around those elements -- those constructive elements and really implement that in the game. And again, I think what we had talked about with the community is, it was an earlier build of the game that we used for the beta as the team continues to work, and tune, and polish the final build for the game. So, we feel really good about that. I think when you think about the early access numbers and engaging numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand.  The game is very appealing, the setting is very appealing, the modalities of play, the innovation and creativity that does, and the other things to work on that game -- have put into the game is something that the community's receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about. I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday, I get that on a calendar basis, that looks the same as Battlefield 5. I would tell you though needing the Battlefield 5, we did not see the level of demand we're seeing now. We did not have the level of innovation and again that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high-fidelity gaming experience that we have now. And so net-net coming out of the beta, we feel very good about player demand, the team has been working very hard on tuning and polish and filing the game where we feel really good about the game that the committee is going to get to play on day one. And the team also has wonderful plans for the future large service. That stuff where there's notion of [Indiscernible] nearly engaging our players deeply in the ability to create their own Battlefield experiences. And so, we feel very good and confident about the future Battlefield at this stage. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. The other thing I would -- I'd remember about Black Friday is that in years past there may have been 5 times more games in the marketplaces that will be this year. We already know that many games have been postponed, and so the calendar is nowhere near as crowded. Which means the need for discounting is nowhere near as high. Second is, and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60 plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield cues even more to PCs, which means the download numbers going to be even higher. And what that Allows us to do, is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from an ability to sell through a lot of games, as well as not have to discount those games dramatically. Mr. David: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin Sebastian : Thank you and good afternoon. A couple from me as well. Apex performance looks really strong. The season updates are driving a lot of usage and monetization growth, but I'm curious beyond those updates and the Mobile extensions. Is it fair to say that you don't really see a need still for a bigger refresh or sequel to either Apex or the Legacy franchise? And then secondly, I might have missed it, but I didn't see commentary on Fiscal '23 growth in the release, which I think you had included last quarter. Thanks Andrew Wilson : And I'll let Blake the second part. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. That's what I'm about to say. Andrew Wilson : We continue to believe. Again, I go back to respond as a team, have been very deliberate and thoughtful about developing and building this franchise and nurturing and growing the community and their engagement over time. And I actually -- I think we're just at the beginning, I think there's such tremendous upside, and all that we're doing both in the existing experience on existing platforms and as we expand the Mobile. But again, I have nothing to announce today. But when you think about the broader ecosystem of experiences, we plan to offer, I wouldn't discount the notion of adding more modalities of play or even more tradition modalities of play to that experience, overtime. Blake Jorgensen : And I would just note following the number of characters that are now in the game versus on day 1 are dramatically different and just gives you a sense of how that game is continuing to evolve, not to mention the ways to play, the modalities, land, the maps and so forth. On the 23 questions, I think, you know this, because we've been talking about just business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about 23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23 and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today in that optimism and excitement.  And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is in a lot of services, and that comprises things like Ultimate Team, Apex, Mobile, The Sims. It is questioning the special sauce of what we do. It is bringing people together, make sure that they're part of a social network, and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged in what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry. We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time basically, for -- mainly the life of this Company.  And we 've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time. And when you then broaden that across The Sims and Mobile titles. And then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real life services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So, we're very confident in growth for next year independent of any one title because of that live service component of our business. And we're very excited about what that means going forward, and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time Colin Sebastian : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Martin Yan with Oppenheimer. Martin Yan : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question, I have 2. Number 1 is on FIFA or sports games with collection elements. In general, how do you think about maybe maintaining the value of player investments and making their annually investments into the micro-transactions [Indiscernible] during over, perhaps on longer time? And I have a second question. Andrew Wilson : Do you want to give us a second question then we'll answer them? Martin Yan : Sure. Andrew Wilson : We'll, answer them both. Martin Yan : So, the second question is on your -- maybe our detailed rationale of elevating the studio GMs to executive leadership team. I think that's quite unique for a AAA publisher, and maybe help us understand what are the benefits and what exactly they will do to, in their decision--making and how they are getting involved with the executive leadership team. Andrew Wilson : Both really good questions. I think of that -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly our sports games, again, in different across different franchise. And so, collectability has different value over time. And collectability games like FIFA, and Maden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time. And the short answer to that is yes. And the slightly longer answer to that is, we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players. And we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy. And you're seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending that -- they're getting that value. But we will continue -- as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players. To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a Company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content. There were tools to more deeply engage the community, there will be aggregation and distribution of that content on aggregated audience. And there is an ecosystem born out of the engagement content, but exist beyond the [Indiscernible] gaming experience. At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers stops with the games and the content that we create. And so, for me it was really saying to our creative leaders. I want to make sure that you are in a strategic conversation, is going to help us drive growth as a Company. I think it is a very central strands of DNA of who we are.  They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our Company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next buys of growth of this Company are going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors but it will all start with that content. And as the leaders of the teams that create that content, I thought it was important to have them in the conversation. Martin Yan : Got it. Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Next questions from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Clay Griffin : Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to Battlefield. You've talked about there being a strong free-to-play component within Battlefield ultimately. So, I guess, putting aside the Mobile extension, do you have a better sense of what that might look like now or do you need to see the engagement with the various game modes, I guess post launch and [Indiscernible]? Andrew Wilson : Yeah, when we think about all of our games and our big blockbuster franchises like Apex, like FIFA, like Madden, like Battlefield [Indiscernible] we're always thinking about innovation and creativity at its core, how do we build that out into modalities of play? How do we think about that across platform? How do we think about the extension those experiences and business model is 1 piece of that puzzle? I think when we look at our Battlefield franchise today with the knowledge that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future.  Job number 1 was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category and I think that's what they have seek -- sort of do. And that's what they've achieved through this 128-plan multiplayer [Indiscernible] expansion, deeper engagement in creativity to portal mode, and innovative new modes in and around the game. I think the next page of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield Mobile total. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we ever think about further expanding apply those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now. Clay Griffin : Great. And then I guess, if you look at Battlefield historically, I guess my sense is that the community has as a general rule, not always maybe embrace cosmetic customization to the extent we've seen in other games. I guess, the question is, is that a fair assessment? And if so, I guess how do you think about monetization without reverting back to a DLC type monetization mechanic that might fracture the player base? Andrew Wilson : Yes. I'm not sure the notion of not being engaged in cosmetic content, is a fair assessment. I think that I don't feel premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out. 12, 18, 24 months. I think we saw deep engagements from the community in that. I think what we also sold out which we didn't get all of the community to engage deeply in that. And some parts the community want to engage in kind of a different profile. And so, we did away with premium, we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service. I feel good about what the team has planned now, I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend and enhance their experience and engage.  Why that makes sense for them, but it doesn't bifurcate or trifurcate the community anyway. So, I think that this is a great community. I think they're a core community. I think the franchise and beloved amongst them. I think what we're seeing, even having been out of the market for 3 years, is demand and appeal continues to be incredibly high. And I'm excited about what we're going to launch with again, but I'm even more excited by the plans the team has taken and grow and expand that experience for global player. Clay Griffin : Great. Thanks for that. Operator : Your next questions from Mario Lu, with Barclays. Mario Lu : Great, thanks for taking a question. My question is on previous pack. In the pack, I believe roughly 1/3 of Ultimate Team players for payers. So, any color you can share on how the payer conversion has improved via this new mechanism and secondly, do you think this method of monetization is specific to player pack or can it be transferred to other titles like into Apex packs for example? Andrew Wilson : I don't have specific metrics on Pike conversion that I can share today. I'm going to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements we did in Ultimate Team, including one element which is the preview products. We've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall. And as we've rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spender or a different type of spender on the comics to preview packs. And so, what's clear to us is this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way throughout our growing play [Indiscernible] engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new place of value for our players, and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience. On the notion of could -- evolve into other areas. I think the shortage that is absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the surprise and delight of the traditional surprise mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for this pond apply base. And then there's another group applies -- want to think differently about how they extended enhance their experience.  And you should expect that we will take the learning from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our Mobile business, and things like Apex Legends, bring that back into our sports franchises. So, part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle, and having 0.5, billion implied in our network engaging deeper in the experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio and we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise-to-franchise. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric Handler : Thank you, very much and good evening, 2 questions for you. First on Apex Legends. I'm curious, a little over a year or so ago, we -- you started to talk a little bit more about localization for the game. Wonder if you could give us a little update there and how that's impacted the engagement, or bookings, or whatever. And then secondly, I think it's been a couple of quarters since we've heard much about The Sims Franchise. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about what's happening with that franchise. Is it still on a growth trajectory and where are you seeing innovation there? Blake Jorgensen : Hey, Andrew? Andrew Wilson : I thought you might grab that one, Blake, sorry, Blake Jorgensen : We know. you Eric Handler : Guys Blake Jorgensen : Normally I just pointed him across the table, or he points at me. The Apex Legends, I'll start there, and to Andrew can talk a little bit about The Sims. We continue to work on how and why Apex works in certain markets. And there are certain markets, that it is unbelievable the strength of the franchise, where we haven't really done much of it than localized the language. Japan is a great example of that. And so, the team has been working hard, particularly on the Mobile build of the game to be able to localize it more to how people want to play the game in those markets. And then you want to be careful that you don't bifurcate the game in too many ways, but there may be some ways cosmetically or beyond language adjustments to make the game more powerful in those markets. And you should have seen that soon, that's an ongoing process. It is hard to see and hard for us to carve that out as part of the financials. But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow as that we are doing that, you'll see much more of that as the mobile build, starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets, where people have not played the game on console or PC because those aren't available to them.  And so, part of the markets that we're testing right now, are those types of markets where this is a new game for them, and so we're watching very closely as to how people play that, react to that, do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example, of certain types of gameplays. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the Mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exist. Andrew Wilson : Yeah, and on The Sims again, The Sims is one of the great franchises about industry and exists in a category where we have very little competition as lost doll category. The Sims continued to do well with all engagement metrics up year-over-year. with Q2 bookings were up 32% year-over-year. In July, we released colleagues leading our 11th expansion pack, which quickly became one of the most popular packs we've ever done, Android performance. Well above our internal focus to the franchisees. So, I guess I think this is a growing player base in the seams, the franchise's continued to grow. And I would tell you, again, we had a lot to talk about other than The Sims today. We'll come back and share more in the future, but that team continues to think about how to grow that franchise. Even more than this a -- in a category and with a player base that is very different from the rest of that portfolio. Eric Handler : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Steven Chu with Credit Suisse. Steven Chu : Okay. Thank you. So hey, Andrew and Blake. So, it's kind of building on the Apex Mobile commentary just now. Just wondering if you can give us an update on a more granular level on the cross pollination or polonization, I guess, between your newly acquired Mobile development studios with the EA brands. I think we're all very an ago to watch expand a FIFA audience to 2 billion plus. Given the footprint of football, football slash soccer. So just I understand to do no harm for the newly acquired studios where you have to be thinking about the multiple iterations, FIFA, or I guess UFC, as it might be known in the future. So just an update if you if you can, on what you might be doing in terms of the integration there. Andrew Wilson : Great question. Again, it's still relatively early for these integrations. And Playdemic is really, really early. But what I would tell you is, as we've thought about this, we really think about it across 3 vectors. Which is the core credit teams and how to best get value there and we have built a single Mobile organization out of our EA Mobile teams Playdemic and Glu on the Jeff Koppers, who is an industry veteran but has more than a decade in Mobile leadership. And is really rethinking and building a strong forward-looking strategy around Mobile for us. The second element is IP, and when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle. TAP Sports, baseball, Golf Clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC, hockey, The Sims.  And so, part of what was going that before is we start to think about the integration. We have gone through; we're working on seems to -- we were working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you can take that engine on apply it to the FIFA business, the TAP Sports engine, or the Gulf clash engine to football -- European football or American football. And we're in that planning phase right now and I would say the teams themselves, they're are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises that have global reach and global strength. The third is just kind of our network at play and how we start to work across that.  Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to tight that advertising engine across our client network into our other products. We're already starting to see the benefit. And then things like reach, we've already been able to launch TAP Sports, Baseball into Japan. And so, some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as the leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of Mobile -first talent on global portfolio of IP, a network of half a billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the place of Mobile. Steven Chu : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Pass with Berenberg. Jamie Bass : Thanks for the question. I was actually going to ask a couple of things that Marden, been covered now. So, 1 question remaining, which is stay with commentary from results when your peers about the potential for wage inflation among developers overcoming yet, could you just give a bit of color on how you're thinking on the cost side, are you worried about increasing headcount and the potential cost associated with that? Andrew Wilson : I'm sorry. Blake Jorgensen : Yes. Andrew Wilson : Go ahead Go ahead. Sorry. Blake Jorgensen : I was just going to say we always spend time thinking about that and trying to manage it as best as possible. I think there's no doubt that there's going to be some wage inflation. The bulk of what you, if you're looking at our P&L, the bulk of what you see in terms of increases in Apex are due to the fact that we brought new people into the Company through acquisitions, as well as through new hires. I don't see a substantial wage inflation pressure, but we're always conscious of it and trying to manage that. Jamie Bass : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : And I will just say I think we are committed as an organization. We're very thoughtful with that compensation for all of our people to ensure that we keep pace with the market, and they are fairly rewarded for the amazing work they do. And so far, we have been able to do that really well. And I think we'll continue to do that in the future. Jamie Bass : That's very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your last question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Andrew Marok : Thanks for taking my question. One on the content cadence for Apex. So, response's been clear about their intention to limit crunch and is settled int the quarterly season releases. Is 1 season every 3 months a magic timeframe for players and for respond? Or is it the case were stepping up could potentially increase the velocity of season launches? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : It's an ongoing question. I think there is no straight answer to that. I think there's a lot -- we've got a lot of questions to the response engines are very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team is being very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have in fact staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in LA, they've going another team in Vancouver that continues to work on the game and grow and develop more content.  I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our Company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community and they are building for the long-term. And so, the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe. But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to [Indiscernible] thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time, and that will mean sometimes that every 3 months, sometimes that it will be longer and some time it will be shorter. But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment, to be a hard the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. So, with that, we'll wrap up the call there. Thank you, everyone for joining us and for great questions. Be well, and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Bye So, Operator : This concludes this conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thanks, Anita. Welcome to EA\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. And lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q4 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call is scheduled for Tuesday, May the 10th. As a reminder, we\u2019ll post the schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you and your families and loved ones are staying healthy. Let me first say thank you to our talented teams at Electronic Arts, all 12,000 people putting so much energy every day into doing amazing things for our players. As we begin, I\u2019d also like to say a few words about John passing. John\u2019s passing was a tremendous loss for the American football community, for the sports world at large and for all of us at Electronic Arts. Through his years as a winning coach, as a beloved broadcaster, and as the pioneering namesake of our game, Coach Madden was football for tens of millions of fans. He taught us many things over nearly 35 years of partnership. Some of his most important lessons, including authenticity, are things we\u2019ve held close to EA SPORTS ever since. We feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of Coach\u2019s legacy and just as fortunate to be part of how it will live on through our future Madden NFL games. We will have more to share about how we are honoring Coach Madden in the weeks ahead and from all of us at Electronic Arts, our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with his family, friends and many, many fans.  It has been a year of outstanding growth so far in FY 2022. Q3 was a record quarter, with our live services and mobile portfolio delivering strong recurring revenue and year-over-year growth. Our franchises like Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS titles, The Sims and more have universal appeal and as we expand to more ways to play across more platforms and business models, we are growing our total players, engagement, net bookings and underlying profitability. We did have a challenge in Q3 as the launch of Battlefield 2042 did not meet expectations. Battlefield 2042 was always an ambitious game and our teams pushed to innovate across many dimensions including massive scale and 128-player matches, new modes, new dynamic gameplay and more. Developing this game with our teams working from home for nearly two years ultimately proved to be challenging. Through our processes for testing and preparation, we believed the experience was ready to be put into our players\u2019 hands. We launched with strong stability, however, as more players experienced the full game, it became clear that we are up and -- unanticipated performance issues that we would need to address. Some of the design choices we made with the game also did not resonate with everyone in our community. We are fully committed to realizing the full potential of this game and fully committed to our Battlefield fans. We have already implemented a series of major updates to the game, and there is more to be done. Players can expect meaningful updates to continue in the weeks ahead and we are shifting the first season of live service content to early summer as we work closely with our community to evolve and improve the core experience in Battlefield 2042. Despite Battlefield\u2019s miss against our expectations, with the strength of our business we are continuing to deliver record growth and performance in FY 2022. With Battlefield\u2019s performance to-date and our decision to move the first season of live service into Q1 FY 2023, so we can focus on the core experience, we have adjusted our full fiscal year net bookings guidance to $7.525 billion, which remains $225 million above our original net bookings guidance for FY 2022. On the strength of our live services, operational discipline and continuing digital transformation, we\u2019re reaffirming our full-year expectations for underlying profitability. We expect strong growth to continue in FY 2023. Looking across our portfolio, we saw continuing year-over-year growth in total players, engagement, net bookings, cash flow and underlying profitability in Q3. I\u2019ll touch on each of those pieces here. Beginning with total players, our games and experiences connect a global player network that continues to scale. Over the last year, our network has grown to more than 540 million unique active accounts, across more than 18 games and 25 live services, spanning all major platforms from consoles to PC to mobile and cloud. From an engagement standpoint, more players are spending more time in our titles. Looking across our portfolio on all platforms, we\u2019ve had more than 180 million monthly active accounts on average in our games during FY 2022. Apex Legends monthly active players are up more than 30% year-over-year in Q3, and across our combined EA SPORTS portfolio, monthly active players are also growing year-over-year. Engagement is deepening as well, with players spending nearly 20% more time in games across our portfolio in FY 2022 compared to the previous year. Growth in our network and engagement continues to drive growth in our business. With our top franchises delivering strong recurring revenue, our net bookings for Q3 grew 7.4% year-over-year for the quarter and for the full year we project 22% growth in net bookings over last year. Performance across the business and operational discipline also continued to deliver strong cash flow and underlying profitability growth in Q3. This continuing growth is anchored by proven franchises where we have a strong track record for execution. Apex Legends is now one of the biggest and most successful ongoing live services in the industry and is built on our owned IP. With more than 28 million new players joining in the last year and new seasons and in-game events that continue to deliver new experiences to a deeply engaged community, FY 2022 is the biggest year yet for Apex. Average player investment in the game has grown significantly year-over-year and we expect to achieve -- and we continue to expect net bookings for Apex to approach $1 billion in FY 2022. We are expanding to reach more players and viewers, with new original content on the way, our growing Apex Legends esports ecosystem, and Apex Legends Mobile which will soon be moving into soft launch as we continue our worldwide rollout. We\u2019ve had strong engagement and community feedback during closed beta testing and we\u2019re excited for more players to experience Apex Legends Mobile soon. Mobile is a core growth engine for us, and it is accelerating. With new launches and acquired expertise and technologies leveraged across our portfolio, we expect mobile to be a major catalyst in FY 2023 with growth well into double digits. Led by Apex Mobile, our newly-updated FIFA Mobile game, Golf Clash and more unannounced projects, we are expanding our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services to reach new audiences and grow our recurring revenue. EA SPORTS is a powerhouse in the sports and entertainment world. We\u2019ve driven hundreds of millions of dollars in net bookings growth year-to-date, with our EA SPORTS business up nearly 10% year-over-year. We continue to see incredible growth for the future of global soccer and our global soccer franchise was the number one title in the western world in calendar 2021. Madden NFL 22 was the number one sports title in the U.S. during the holiday period and it was the number three top selling game in the U.S. for all of last year. Under our leadership, F1 2021 also continues to perform well above expectations with unit sales nearly doubling year-over-year during the holiday period. In our mobile sports portfolio, we just launched the latest version of our EA SPORTS FIFA Mobile game around the world. This was the biggest update to the game ever and early performance has been exceptional. Engagement is up more than 50% over the previous season and retention in the first week is nearly double. With the added expertise of Playdemic and Glu, and a deep pipeline of new sports experiences in development, EA SPORTS continues to be an exceptional growth business, built on predictable and recurring revenue with outstanding opportunities ahead. Our pipeline further amplifies our strength. In addition to our core franchises, we are building new experiences in some of the biggest enduring IP in entertainment. Last week we announced a new agreement with Disney & Lucasfilm Games to develop new experiences in the Star Wars universe, continuing our collaboration of more than a decade. Respawn is leading development of the next game in our action-adventure Star Wars Jedi series, as well as two additional Star Wars titles. This adds to our deep pipeline of announced and unannounced projects with our wholly-owned IP, including Need for Speed, our BioWare franchises, The Sims, Skate, Dead Space and more. Looking forward, we are continuing to build on the structural advantages of our portfolio and accelerating growth by executing against our core strategy. We are focused on creating amazing games and content, providing creation tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, aggregating and distributing our content and experiences to more players on more platforms, more geographies and business models, and harnessing the power of social ecosystems in and around our games. The demand for amazing games and new ways to play, watch, share and create has never been stronger. As one of the industry\u2019s largest and most profitable businesses with strong recurring revenue, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this continued secular growth. We look forward to delivering against these opportunities through FY 2023 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was a quarter that demonstrated the strength of our live services portfolio. Despite a tough Battlefield launch, we came within a couple of percent of our net bookings guidance and beat our expectations for underlying profitability. The quarter was the largest in our company\u2019s history for net bookings, underlying profitability and cash generation. Sales of Battlefield 2042 were disappointing, but they are offset by a strong showing from FIFA and continued strength from Apex and our other franchises. We delivered net revenue of $1.79 billion and net bookings of $2.58 billion. FIFA 2022\u2019s strong start continued into this quarter, with unit sales now up double-digits over last year, launch to-date and players continued to engage in FIFA Ultimate Team and invest in their teams. This has made it the strongest FIFA launch ever measured from launch to the end of Q3. Apex Legends that split net, excuse me, net bookings continue to grow at an extraordinary rate and will deliver close to a $1 billion for the year. Digital represented 64% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 2 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying Q3 gross margin 2.3 percentage points above last year. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in below our expectations, driven by variable compensation and savings and phasing of marketing spend. It\u2019s worth noting that we were able to hire more people than in any other quarter in our history and are continuing to invest in our games teams. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP net revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.844 billion and earnings per share of $2.43, up from our original expectation of $1.34. We are taking our net bookings guidance for the year to $7.525 billion. Although $100 million reduction on our position at the end of Q2, it is $225 million above our original guidance for the year. The reduction is driven by Battlefield 2042 in both Q3 and Q4, but offset by strength in the rest of the business, particularly in FIFA and Apex Legends. We\u2019re committed to turning Battlefield around and building a sustainable live service, even if some of the actions we\u2019re taking, like moving the first Season into FY 2023, impact net bookings in the short-term. Reflecting the strength of our portfolio, our operating cash flow guidance is now $1.900 billion. This would be close to the largest full year operating cash flow in the company\u2019s history, despite nearly $200 million of one-time tax payments related to acquisitions this year. With capital expenditures still around $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.700 billion. Note that this is $200 million above our original expectations for FY 2022 free cash flow. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.  For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.759 billion, cost of revenue to be $404 million and operating expenses of $1.086 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.46 for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $1.761 billion. This would be our largest Q4 ever, even if we only count organic growth. We\u2019ll formally guide FY 2023 in May, when we report Q4, but we\u2019ve heard that some of you are concerned that the Battlefield performance might impact next year\u2019s growth. Let me emphasize here again that we are a portfolio company. As originally forecast, the Battlefield franchise would have accounted for significantly less than 10% of this year\u2019s net bookings and well below 5% of next year\u2019s. We\u2019re revising those numbers, but you can see it has little impact on FY 2023 growth. The main drivers of growth next year remain FIFA on console, Apex Legends, Apex Mobile and FIFA Mobile. Golf Clash will also contribute to year-on-year growth, since we acquired Playdemic halfway through the year. With regards to new launches in FY 2023, we\u2019ve disclosed that Need for Speed is on the slate and we\u2019ll announce more titles closer to the time. In total, we still expect mid-to-high single-digit growth next year. To summarize, we just delivered the largest quarter in the company\u2019s history. FIFA goes from strength-to-strength. Apex Legends continues to show extraordinary growth. Battlefield disappointed, but our broad portfolio of games and live services insulates us from the impact of any one title. Our portfolio approaches -- approach enables us to deliver double-digit organic growth this year and continue to deliver strong cash flow, and provides a strong foundation for growth as we look to the future. Now before I hand the call to Andrew, you may have notice that yesterday we have a new CFO for the company and I think the new CFO, Chris is going to be a fabulous addition and will do a much better job, probably, than I have ever done. I thank, Andrew and the team, our executive, as well as the entire company for the amazing partnership that I have had here for nine and a half years at EA. It has been the most enjoyable experience of my entire career. I also thank the buying side and sell side analysts and partners for all of their support over the years and wonderful interaction. And last but not least, been Chris Evenden, Eric Green [ph] and Fabiola for their amazing IR performance that interacts with all of you. So, now, I\u2019ll hand the back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Blake. These are exciting times in our industry. Interactive entertainment continues to grow by every measure and our audiences are expanding and diversifying, major franchises are at the center of culture and entertainment, and the world is recognizing how games have the power to connect global communities. Our focus continues to be on our people, our players, on our amazing portfolio of games, content and services, and extraordinary growth opportunities in the future. Thanks to our incredibly talented teams at Electronic Arts, we are delivering entertainment to hundreds of millions of people around the world and connecting them through some of the most powerful and enduring franchises. With the breadth and depth of our business that continues to expand our network, deepen engagement, and drive growth in our recurring net bookings and ongoing profitability, we are well-positioned and strategically -- well-positioned strategically to continue building on our success and delivering for our players. As we look ahead and Blake just referenced, we were excited to announce yesterday that Chris Suh is joining Electronic Arts as our next CFO. Chris is coming to us after more than 25 years at Microsoft, where he served as Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Cloud and AI group, which he led with incredible success during Microsoft\u2019s transformation to a cloud-first company. We have a big vision for the future, and in addition to Chris\u2019 financial leadership of our organization, I look forward to having him as a strategic partner with extensive experience driving scale and growth to help us achieve our goals. As we announced previously, Blake will be leaving our team after nearly a decade of leadership at EA. Blake has been an incredible leader, partner and advisor. But most importantly, he is a dear friend and I feel deeply grateful for our time working together. His expertise and the team he has built have been instrumental in our growth and financial achievements, and have positioned us well for continued success. Blake will remain with us until the summer to assist with the transition and special projects. Thank you, Blake, for everything you\u2019ve done and continue to do for our company, and again, thank you for your friendship. Now, we are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Benjamin Soff : Hey, guys. Just a quick thank you to Blake for being a great partner and looking forward to meeting Chris. Two questions. So, first, just around Battlefield, can you guys sort of frame for us how you think about the vision for the future of that franchise, and in particular, how the new leadership for the Battlefield you are just thinking about expanding and adapting that franchise over time? And I\u2019ve got a second question. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Great question. Again, we have a very bold vision for where this franchise go. This franchise has always led the category in creativity, innovation, scale, gameplay, community. And as we are coming to launch, again, we had a very bold vision for this game. As it turns out, we\u2019ve had some challenges, not least of all, trying to build this game and provide this game from home, and so our focus now is really making sure that core experience lives up to our fans, the community\u2019s expectations. Beyond that we\u2019ll continue to invest and grow the franchise, we have great leadership with Vince and Byron, and others, with tremendous background from other great shooters in the industry, kind of leading the future. I believe that we\u2019re going to see this game do really well over the course of time. I think we\u2019ll expand to mobile. We will expand to other new interesting ways to play. But certainly this is just a moment where we take a pause and do all we can for the core game and the core community. Benjamin Soff : Got it. And then, just in light of the announcement that you guys are working on those three new Star Wars games. Can you talk a little bit more about your vision for that IP? And is it fair to say that going forward, you\u2019re planning to lean more towards investing in your own IP? And if so, what are the like some of the potential pros and cons of that as a strategy? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. The very strength of our business is our balanced portfolio. We have both a deep and a broad portfolio. And what we\u2019ve demonstrated over the course of our, the best part of 40 years is to really develop both our own IP over time, the Need for Speed, The Sims, Battlefield, Apex Legends, our BioWare franchises, we have Skate in development now, Dead Space on the way, so an incredible portfolio of own IP that has an extraordinary following across the industry. Combined with other long-term enduring IP, we have the powerhouse sports franchises. And they are true evergreen franchises and this is not just about licensing content. This is about working with over 300 partners across the various sports industries to deliver a true connection with the sports, the leagues, the teams, the players that our fans love. And we\u2019ve been doing that now for well over 30 years and I think that we will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. And things like the Star Wars franchise, again, a long-term relationship we\u2019ve had with Disney for more than a decade. And this is not simply about building or revisiting things that already exist in the universe, but really adding to that Star Wars universe and really delivering new opportunities for Star Wars fans to experience great Star Wars content. And so as you think about our strategy going forward and the strength of our company, it really comes down to our ability to develop and build and publish industry-leading owned IP, but also work with partners over decades to truly deliver fan favorites with long and enduring fan bases, like, our Sports franchises and like Disney. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hey. Thanks. Thanks for taking the call and just reiterate the positive sentiment from Blake. Blake is doing a great run. Really enjoyed it. I guess I just had really one question. No follow up. You\u2019re -- one of your bigger competitors was just taken out. You guys have quite a good portfolio and have taken a portfolio approach for years. How do you think the industry will look in three years or four years? Do you guys see yourself as a consolidator of potential seller? How do you see this industry shaking out over the next three years to five years? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Great question. And you should imagine we read this for some time as it turns out and part of the reason why we have built the strength in our broad and deep portfolio and why we have gone out in search of the best teams in the industry to bring them into our company and build great entertainment for our global player base, what is now well over 0.5 billion fans, is because we do believe in the power of entertainment. We just believe in the power of interactive entertainment. I think what we\u2019re seeing now in the marketplace is the launching of the value of what we do in particular. And so, as I think about the attainment coming together, you\u2019re seeing some other companies talk about this. But when we think about our players and we think about the things that they engage in, they play our games more than any other form of entertainment, but they also consume linear media and scripted entertainment and sports broadcasts, and music and other things. And so, as we look at the future, we are building strength in our whole ability to live interactive entertainment to our fans, which we think will continue to grow well north of a 1 billion fans over time. But we\u2019re also aware that our fans are expecting us to find new and interesting ways for them to experience entertainment. And so, as our -- as we think about the future, you should think about it with IP at the center and engagement around play, watch, creep, social ecosystem that brings that they love. And when you look at our strategy of what we\u2019re doing around in great -- creating great entertainment, around building tools, so that now community can engage more deeply, around the aggregation and distribution of content across platforms, across business models, across geographies, and really leaning into the social ecosystem to the board out of engagement in our games, I think you should imagine that\u2019s what the world look [Technical Difficulty] Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark. Your line is now open. Mike Hickey : Hey, Andrew, Blake, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. And Blake, I\u2019m going to miss you buddy. I am sure you would be getting a lot of skin and so I\u2019m not feeling sorry for you. But it\u2019s been great working with you, so. Question is, I guess, on Battlefield, obviously, disappointed. Can you give us -- can you size the units you sold in the quarter? I think you\u2019ve guided for 12 or so, but just sort of curious where you ended up versus expectations? And then thinking about how you sort of re-engage that audience. There\u2019s been some ideas around beta play, curious about the possibility? And then I didn\u2019t hear mobile, have you got mobile for Battlefield or is that just delayed? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Sure. Let me -- Mike, thanks for your nice comment to the other analysts as well. Unfortunately, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get as much skin as I would like. But we\u2019re going to refrain from trying to give updates there. Remember, Battlefield is less than 10% of our revenue. We sold less units than we thought we would. But what I would say is that, remember these [Technical Difficulty] and so our goal is to add new excitement to stretch this out. And in some ways, we hoped it benefits FY 2023 since we\u2019ve had a pretty strong FY 2022 and so it helps us in the future. I\u2019ll let Andrew address the second part of your question. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. So, I think that, you remember coming into the launch, the demand measures were very high, influence for us. The core underlying created for the game still has really strong demand around it. And we -- as I mentioned, we had some challenges around stability, particularly on high end PC machines and performance and there were some design decisions, but not all the community really agreed with. And so our focus right now is to really go back in and make sure we get that stuff right. And as much as I hate to admit it, DICE\u2019s the studio that has been able to do this a number of times now and really go back and rebuild at the core and reengage the community, as long as we do that in conjunction with a committee. That\u2019s what that studio was so great at doing. So I think the combination of DICE with the new leadership and a strong vision for the future, we will build out the core, we will reengage the community and we will manifest that demand that we saw coming into launch over the course of time. Mobile is still developing, the metrics are showing up really strong. I think, right now we\u2019re looking at going into the next closed beta at the end of this month, and as is the case of mobile, we need to choose and test in the environment. And then as it relates to free-to-play and other modes of play, again we have a big bold vision for this franchise. This franchise since its inception has been a leader in creativity and innovation was how it\u2019s played and how it\u2019s delivered. And you should expect that we will continue to work to deliver new and interesting ways to engage with this game over the course of time. And while I\u2019m disappointed with how it launched, I\u2019m still very excited for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Eric Handler : Good afternoon and thanks for the question. Andrew, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about when you think about the expansion that\u2019s going on in the video games industry in the last year or so and we\u2019re seeing a lot of user-generated content and platforms around that start to proliferate. We\u2019ve seen a lot of venture capital funding into blockchain and NFT gaming, wondering how you\u2019re thinking about those channels eventually and it\u2019s easier to build from within? Is it better to buy once there\u2019s some established players there? Just want to get your mindset there. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Great question. I will tell you, I started this industry over 20 years ago. At that point in time it was the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet by a wide margin. I think it has been the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet every year since then. But still people seem to be surprised by this. So we\u2019re not surprised by it at all, and I think, as technology has continued to evolve, we have been able to deliver new and interesting and fun ways to engage with content. And what we\u2019ve seen more recently is just how powerful the social ecosystem, the social networks bought out of engagement in our games truly are amazing. Now -- it\u2019s not now just about ingesting entertainment the same way we do traditional scripted media or traditional broadcasters, usual music. This is about experiencing entertainment with your friends and that\u2019s unbelievably powerful. I think that has been really the fuel that has driven the growth in recent time. As part of that, of course, the ability to create your own content and put it into that ecosystem has become a really valuable part of, of what our industry offers to our players and our fans. The traditional media just doesn\u2019t and this is something that we hold true. Again, it\u2019s been at the very center of The Sims for a long time. It\u2019s at the very center of mode like FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team, to the very center of the design of Skate, which we\u2019ll be launching soon. And so this concept of UGC or user-generated content is really just an extension of the social interaction that I\u2019m able to have with my friends in and around experiencing what is the best anytime on the planet. And so I believe that\u2019s going to be a really important part of our future. Now, to the extent whether we want to build that out or buy out over time, right now we are building, we\u2019re building technology, we\u2019re building credit, we\u2019re building assets with we\u2019re offering that out to communities around the world and we\u2019re seeing great uptake of that. If there was an acquisition opportunity in the future, we would openly look at that, but we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not looking at anything at this juncture. Around the NFT and where VCs are investing, again we see this also happened our industry. We start with 3D, we start with AR/VR, we\u2019re now seeing with MCs. There\u2019s always something in and around our industry that is driving a lot of external investment. The way I look at this is, collectability is really built on four key metrics. It\u2019s around high quality content, it\u2019s around scarcity, it\u2019s around proof-of-authenticity and it\u2019s around a group of people that find value in that content. And we\u2019ve seen that happen in the real world and we\u2019ve seen that happen in a virtual world. We\u2019ve certainly seen that happen in and around our games for some number of years. And I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players. Whether that\u2019s part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we\u2019re going to -- we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re driving audience. Eric Handler : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Matthew Thornton : Hey. Good afternoon, Andrew and Blake absolute best of luck to you and your future endeavors here. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I guess two questions. First for me, you got to talk about in the back half of the fiscal year, obviously, Battlefield missed. That\u2019s partially offset by strengthen in FIFA, Apex and others. With FIFA, in particular, I guess, you talked a lot about kind of unit strength year-on-year? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you felt about or are feeling about your Ultimate Team and the live services component into the back half of the year? I guess, it\u2019s first question. Second question, I am curious, you are coming back to mobile, and maybe some of the recent acquisitions, kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about advertising, I know, it\u2019s come up a bit, other companies might get 10% to 20% of their mobile bookings from advertising, Glu brings some new capabilities, I am curious how you are thinking about advertising, I am curious how you\u2019re thinking about the Glu pipeline, you have almost a year into that deal. And then also, when we might start to hear a little more about kind of what your plans are with Metalhead and Super Mega baseball? Thanks guys. Blake Jorgensen : So let me -- I\u2019ll start on the live service piece and then I will let Andrew hit the second question. Live service growth in the quarter was 9% and trailing 12 months is 21%, and that\u2019s across all of our live services. And so, if you look at something like Apex or FIFA, they\u2019re clearly well north of that. And we feel -- continue to feel it is one of the cores of our business, because it is reoccurring and highly dependent on the social networks that we\u2019ve created in our games, and particularly, on sports, those are evergreen networks that continue every year. And so the metrics we see are exceptional up well over last year. If you look at the Apex numbers, as we reported, the dramatic improvement year-over-year and everything they do is continuing to try to drive engagement with people that brought a large number of new players into the game or obtained players and continue to come up with amazing and unique ideas for ways to play. So we\u2019re very excited about how that continues and it continues across all of our sports, and we\u2019re looking as to how do we do that across more and more games going forward. So I\u2019ll let Andrew talk about Glu a little bit. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Again, we are working closely with Glu. It is still relatively early days with the acquisition for both them and Playdemic, and we are working both on bolstering our existing 15 live services and building out new ones. And as per my prepared remarks, we\u2019re projecting well into double-digit growth next year and that includes Apex Mobile and renewed FIFA Mobile, and a full year of Golf Clash and ongoing growth across the portfolio and we\u2019re excited about that. With respect to advertising, specifically, we are taking the Glu advertising stack and applying it across our games. And it\u2019s little early to know just yet exactly how that will manifest, but based on what we are seeing across the industry, we expect that that represents some revenue growth there also. So, overall, mobile now really is a strength of ours. It\u2019s a very important part of how we drive growth in the business, both in our existing games, in our new launches and with the potential of mobile advertising across the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Your line is now open. Drew Crum : Okay. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and Blake, best of luck. I am Curious as to your thoughts on where the businesses in terms of engagement normalizing? Is the reopening headwind behind you or is this something we should anticipate in calendar 2022? Is it contemplated in their fiscal 2023 net bookings forecast? And then, separately, your OpEx growth year-to-date is approaching 30% year-on-year? Should we see that slow materially once you start to anniversary acquisitions or how should we be thinking about OpEx going forward? Thanks. Blake Jorgensen : Yeah. I can take the OpEx question quickly, Drew. I mean, clearly, most of that was driven by two things; one is, our acquisitions, probably, the biggest driver of it; but second is, driven by the fact that we\u2019ve used this opportunity of some questions in the gamer community about which companies are going to be around and which aren\u2019t, and we\u2019ve been able to hire some amazing talent during that because of our stability. And so that doesn\u2019t continue on forever. Obviously, the acquisition growth is a one-time component, sorry. So, I think, we\u2019re -- remember our OpEx is really comes down on two things, headcount and marketing expense. So the marketing expense will swing by the titles that are in any one year, but we\u2019re pretty good at managing that. And the headcount we\u2019re also very good at managing and so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a jump like we\u2019ve seen this past year. But remember, even with the OpEx growth that you see, look at the Q3 EPS number. I mean, clearly, we\u2019ve been able to manage that even with a downdraft of $48 million in revenue that we didn\u2019t originally plan. And so we\u2019re a pretty flexible organization to be able to try to manage that to keep margins going and so I think you\u2019ll see that going forward. Andrew Wilson : On engagement through or post-COVID, depending on how you think about it, I think we\u2019ve been on a rolling situation around the world of kind of coming back and shaved down a little and coming back. Broadly speaking, though, much of the world is out and about, they\u2019re at sporting events, they go into theme parks, they\u2019re watching movies, they\u2019re going to dinner. So much of the world has returned mostly to normal at this juncture by our calculation. Even as part of that we\u2019ve seen not only number of players grow, again, over 540 million people now on our network, we\u2019ve also seen time spent in our games grow by over 20%. And I kind of look to that as not just about creating amazing games, entertainment, but it is the social interaction. I think what COVID has taught us is that games are a great way not just to get our entertainment fixed, to remain deeply connected with our friends and fans and rivals. And what we\u2019re seeing now, I believe, is actually the long-term effect of the discovery of not just the value of our of what we do in terms of entertainment, but also the value in maintaining connections with those we care most about and we would expect that to continue and actually create a flywheel for added growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is now open. Jason Bazinet : Thanks. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to talk about this. But I would be very curious about how you\u2019re thinking about your business and strategies that relates to the metaverse as that becomes more real. Is that something that you view is just another opportunity for you to engage your fans? Is it a battle about time span? Is it potentially sort of change industry, sort of rev shares or is it just sort of a non-event and you guys think you can sort of continue to focus on your IP and engagement and it\u2019s really sort of not material? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. I mean a great question and certainly another one of these things that is kind of a topic gives you at the moment and many people are talking about it in different contexts, quite frankly. At the end of the day, the metaverse is a three dimensional social space where you come together to experience things with your friends. And so now much of that happens in the two dimensional internet around the social networks that we see. But I will tell you, a lot of that happens in the context of our games. And as I look at the nature of our games, I look at the engagement that we\u2019re seeing inside these 3D spaces that we create in and around sports and other worlds. What you see with our industry is the beginnings of what a metaverse might be. And over the course of time, you should expect us to continue to expand and extend the world that we have been creating for the last 30 years and deliver more experiences beyond the core consider the game. So what can you do in FIFA beyond playing football? What were you doing Need for Speed beyond driving the game? What will you do in The Sims as you come together with your friends beyond the creation of content? And you\u2019ll see that continue to evolve for us over the course of time. And I don\u2019t know ultimately what the metaverse will become. But what I do know is the games we create are becoming more important as social spaces and they are just as places to enjoy great entertainment as we continue to build out those experiences and as whatever the metaverse becomes it\u2019s an almost certainty that we will play a very important role in it and that our players will be on the leading edge of the evolution of what these spaces might become. Jason Bazinet : That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mike Ng : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about EA Play, where are we with EA Play subscriber today and how do you see the outlook for video games description services changing particularly with recent consolidation? And then, second, it was encouraging to hear the reiteration of the mid-to-high single-digit topline growth for next year? I was wondering if you could go a little bit more in detail around some of the drivers. What do you see driving some of the FIFA trends and are there new games or unannounced titles embedded in that outlook? Thank you very much. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Let me quickly hit on the EA Play component and then I\u2019ll let Blake talk about the mid-to-high single-digit growth. EA Pay continues to grow for us. It continues to be a really, really positive consumer experience, getting access to some of the greatest content in the industry. What we see more broadly across entertainment is its subscription continues to be a core driver. And what we\u2019re able to do is drive ongoing engagement, perhaps, in a way, even it -- the stronger than traditional linear or scripted entertainment. I think that you\u2019ll -- we will continue to see consumers engage in our content through subscription and we will continue to provide our content that way and I think we\u2019ll start to see more and more growth across platform. We continue to be the leading provider of a gaming subscription across platforms in our industry, and with the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the new experiences we have coming. We believe that we\u2019re going to continue to drive growth. And over the course of time back to my earlier point around entertainment, you might expect us to do more things beyond just games in the context of that subscription around a broader service for our clients and we\u2019re pretty excited about what that might become over the course of time. Blake Jorgensen : And on the 2023 question, obviously, as we said, we\u2019re not yet ready to give guidance, which we normally don\u2019t do at this time of the year, but we did give some hints. And the keys to driving growth are obviously our core portfolio, things like FIFA, for example, and live services is associated with it, bat and hockey and other sports. Apex Legends, obviously, has continued to evolve and show an amazing growth. We will have an Apex Legends Mobile game in the market. We don\u2019t know exactly what time that will be and there\u2019ll be a global build for that game, as well as the Chinese build for that game. And we\u2019re working with a partner there and things are going very well in test, but we\u2019re excited about that as a major growth driver. We will have more growth we think out of the FIFA Mobile game that we just put into the market. And remember that we only had our book, really a half of year of Playdemic Golf Clash game. We\u2019ll have a full year event next year. And we\u2019re working with Playdemic on how they can take that Clash mechanic into other sports areas where we have licenses already. And then we\u2019ve got a Need for Speed game coming and there are three or four more things to that we haven\u2019t announced yet, but you can imagine we are always trying to find ways to grow the portfolio year-over-year through new titles, new IP and expansion. And as well, acquisitions, which right now we\u2019re in the digest mode, but doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t keep looking at everything going forward. So we\u2019re excited about next year. It looks like a strong year to come. And as Andrew said, we know that this is one of the greatest entertainment vehicles in the world right now until we\u2019re really in the sweet spot and that\u2019s what gets us excited about it. Mike Ng : Great. Thank you both. Sounds incredibly helpful. And Blake, best of luck in your next chapter. Blake Jorgensen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is now open. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and Blake, it\u2019s been a pleasure interacting with you over the years. Blake Jorgensen : I appreciate that. Mario Lu : Yeah. I guess the first question is more high level. You guys said in your slides. Spending -- playing time is increased 20% this quarter compared to the year prior? What was the largest driver of that and I don\u2019t know if you have this data, but what\u2019s the typical lag historically between growth and time span and monetization? And then, secondly, you guys did not really talk about Madden as much on this call. So just wondering what the delta is between it performance versus like a FIFA. Are things, like, maybe unpack something what\u2019s kind of driving the growth here, anything out of Madden that you can talk about? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. So let me start with Madden. Madden is also having a great year and we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth. As you know and then for all of you who follow the season, this has been an unbelievably exciting season of football and what we know\u2026 Blake Jorgensen : 49ers. Yeah. Andrew Wilson : \u2026and let\u2019s -- well, and what\u2019s exciting for a second, the playoff games and the season overall has been an unbelievably exciting game. The ratings for the NFL have been extremely strong through the year and that\u2019s driving really strong engagement in and around our Madden franchise and it continues to go from strength-to-strength. Blake Jorgensen : With respect to what drove engagement, again, we have this great portfolio and while we certainly saw extraordinary growth in Apex Legends, we saw a great growth in FIFA. We also saw growth across the portfolio. And on -- Apex was 30%, FIFA was our esports portfolio was up 10% on what is a very big number. But we\u2019ve seen growth across the portfolio that speaks to the value of the breadth and the depth of our portfolios. In terms of lag between engagement and monetization growth, which I think was one part of your question there. I don\u2019t have exact numbers for you on that. What I would say is our teams work very closely with the communities and ensure that they\u2019re always providing new and interesting content. And what we know about all of our communities they play and they make a choice of do they want to invest more time or do they want to invest more money in the experience and it\u2019s really the ability to build that balanced ecosystem that speaks to the strength of our live services over time. And so it\u2019s a very symbiotic relationship that happens between the investment of time and investment money over the course of the experience and our teams have become very, very good at that and work very, very closely with their communities to drive it. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. And one thing, I just remind everybody, and we may have already said this, but I\u2019ll say it again. We shipped last year order due to the pandemic. We delayed it three weeks to move it into the third [Tech Difficulty] this year and the second quarter. So when you look at the growth of the third quarter, knowing that that didn\u2019t include the initial shift in a FIFA, it\u2019s almost hard to believe the strength of the business. And so I just want our people not to forget that and we\u2019re not going to provide numbers or details around that exactly, but just know that the situation we are having moved [Technical Difficulty] back to the second quarter. It\u2019s pretty impressive. Mario Lu : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Andrew Marok : Thanks for taking my questions and wanted to pass my best wishes on to Blake as well. On Apex Legends, so season 12 seems like a more substantial content drop than the typical season. So whether it\u2019s amount of content or type of content, is there anything that particularly stands out as a driver for new player acquisition and engagement, whether it\u2019s game modes, new maps or things like that? And then second on FIFA, around the growth in unit sales year-over-year? I guess, at this point, who was interested in FIFA 2022 that maybe wasn\u2019t in FIFA 2021? Are there any particular markets or customer segments that saw solid unit growth? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Well, some detailed questions and the great question. So thank you. On Apex, again, as we -- as the teams put together these seasons of content and they think about that new content, a new modality to play, a new ways to connect. Remember, Apex is now well over 100 million clients. So there\u2019s no one size fits all component that really attracts new players or engages any broad group of players deeply. I think what the esports team and the Apex team in particular have been able to demonstrate is they work very close with their community. They deeply engage with their community and they are delivering content modalities, applying maps, these things that really speak to what the community are asking for and what we\u2019ve seen since the very beginning of the launch of this game is them being able to work in a very calculated way around the delivery of really interesting new content, new maps and new models apply on a season by season basis that has continued to grow the overall player base, continue to grow the overall experience, continue to grow the engagement that play base has with the experience and the investment those players are making as part of their engagement. And so we\u2019re very excited about that. Blake Jorgensen : And then, with respect to FIFA, again, this is another team that has demonstrated the power of working very closely with the community in and around a live service. Football, soccer, as we call it in this country continues to grow the leagues, the teams, the players are going from strength-to-strength in popularity. As -- we have over 300 licenses in the game and answering the partners that we work with in the provision of what is a growing, broadening, deepening experience for our player base. And as the world of football grows, as we build our fan base, again, if you think about the fan base we have for our product or our service, it\u2019s the largest digital football club in the world with well over 100 million fans and we work very close with that fan base around their ability to experience football in a way that\u2019s most meaningful to them, around their league, around their teams, around the plays and love. And the reason we are always continued to drive growth in and around that franchise is because we do work very closely with our global community of fans and we are delivering them again, content gameplay modalities of play that is most interesting and most exciting to them, and connects them most deeply with the sport they love and the fans they love it with. Andrew Marok : Thank you. Operator : Your next -- okay. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz from Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Creutz : Hey. Thank you. Cloud+ dropped a pretty expensive looking halo trailer over the weekend and Netflix has had some success with The Witcher and League of Legends on their streaming service. There\u2019s absolutely ravenous demand for content right now from 0.5 dozen or so streaming services. And you guys have some IP particularly within BioWare that I think would be pretty good as a basis for show. Are we finally at a point where video game IP has some meaningful transmedia opportunities or do you think that\u2019s still more theory than a reality? Andrew Wilson : No. I think what -- based on exactly what you just said and what we\u2019ve experienced, there is -- video game IP or interactive entertainment IP is now some of the most culturally relevant IP in all of entertainment and I think that\u2019s going to continue to grow. When you think about hundreds of millions of fans engaging in and around the IP we create, like, Apex, like, The Sims, like Need for Speed, like, our BioWare franchises, like, Dead Space, like, Skate. It\u2019s not a natural to that to spawn kind of a scripted entertainment element. I think traditionally, the scripted entertainment elements in our industry have not been big revenue drivers themselves. But where there have been a high quality, they\u2019ve lifted the overall engagement the franchise more deeply, so there\u2019s kind of a one, two punch that drives growth in the business. I think as we think about our future, we do believe that this thing that we do that is interactive entertainment is becoming more and more important on a daily basis to all things, and that our fans are going to want to experience that in many different modalities and some of that might be scripted entertainment in nature. And you should expect that the way we\u2019re looking at any and all aspects that allow us to expand and expand our brands for our fan base. But we\u2019re doing it very thoughtfully, and again, as part of our strategy doing it profitably. Doug Creutz : Great. Thanks, Andrew, and best wishes, Blake. Blake Jorgensen : Thanks, Doug. Look, I think, that\u2019s the last question. I appreciate everyone\u2019s [Technical Difficulty] support us and I\u2019ll be around for a while and make sure that we get our new CFO fully on board, and as I said, he will be much better than me. So everyone stay healthy and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I hope all of you are well. I want to start by thanking our incredible teams at Electronic Arts. We have the most talented people in the industry who, every day, demonstrate passion, creativity, and determination. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Chris Suh. Chris joined us in March as our new Chief Financial Officer. He is an exceptionally qualified leader, and I am looking forward to our partnership as we drive our next phase of growth. EA delivered profitable growth in FY '22, a record year in every important measure of our business. Total players, engagement in our games and live services, net bookings, and underlying profit. We grew our global network of players to more than 580 million unique active accounts, fueled by new players joining titles including EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends and The Sims, and new players that we welcomed from our acquisitions. The strength of our broad IP portfolio, our creative talent together with highly re-occurring revenue streams continues to super-charge growth in our business. We delivered $7.515 billion in net bookings and underlying profit grew more than 20%. It was a record year, and our talented teams rose to the challenge in a big way, to inspire and entertain hundreds of millions of engaged players worldwide. Games are now central to people's lives, and younger audiences have more power as consumers. Gen Alpha, Gen Z and Millennials are digital natives and they are gaming-first generations. They see gaming as their number one choice for entertainment. The consumption of entertainment and sport is deeply social, with players across our network using games to stay connected to friends, and to express themselves. The future of entertainment is interactive, and we derive strength from three structural advantages : our IP; our incredible talent; and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services. First, our IP. Everything begins with amazing games, and we continue to invest in one of the most powerful IP portfolios in all of entertainment. Apex Legends will expand in every dimension, going from strength to strength. New gameplay is coming to the console and PC live service; our new mobile service launches globally this month; and the grand finale of the 2022 Apex Legends Global Series for esports is in July. EA SPORTS & Racing is set to grow significantly in FY '23. We have six new EA SPORTS titles this year, with more in development Our pipeline for this year and future years features big, beloved IP that we cannot wait for players to experience including Need for Speed, Dead Space, Star Wars, The Sims, Skate, our Bioware franchises, and Lord of the Rings. Our two new studios in Seattle are working on new projects, our Motive studio has an unannounced title in development, and we have more underway across our global studio teams. Next, we have the best talent in the world. Making amazing games starts with incredible game makers. Innovating across our business, our people make Electronic Arts a great place to work from delivering safe and secure platforms, to telling exciting stories and developing our next generation of creators. We are a collective team of leaders who together deliver one of the broadest portfolios in the industry every year, while continuing to pioneer new experiences. We are proud of our distinctive talent from across the many parts of EA for continuing to deliver more exceptional games and content at scale. Finally, we have a large growing network of players deeply engaged in live services. To provide a sense of scale, we had more daily, weekly, and monthly active players across our entire portfolio. FIFA Mobile recorded its biggest quarter ever, with unique new players surging nearly 80% year-over-year, and Apex Legends is amongst the top live service games in the industry. As we look ahead, we are investing in ways for fans to have amazing, shared experiences together, whether that\u2019s by playing, watching or creating. Through our console, PC, and mobile live services; through esports; through other original content; and with tools that unleash the creativity of our players, we will grow what are already some of the world's largest and most engaged entertainment communities. Earlier today we announced that starting next fiscal year, our football experiences will move under a new EA SPORTS FC brand. This is such an exciting moment for us and our fans. We've just had our biggest year ever for EA SPORTS FIFA games, building on nearly 30 years of connected experiences for players across more than 150 million unique accounts. With more than 300 license partners, 30 leagues and federations, 700 teams, and 19,000 athletes, the future of global football is huge. We're excited to grow EA SPORTS FC. It will be the only place that fans can play in the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, LaLiga, MLS and many others. Our global football franchise has long been at the forefront of innovation. From the first isometric playing angles, to online play, Ultimate Team and Women's Teams, the first narrative story mode with The Journey, to VOLTA, to Hypermotion, we have repeatedly delivered new ways to play the game. We're thankful for many great years of partnership with FIFA, and we are looking forward to delivering another full EA SPORTS FIFA game later this year, filled with great features and World Cup content. Then, the new era begins next year with EA SPORTS FC. With a total addressable market of more than 3.5 billion football and soccer fans worldwide, EA SPORTS FC will be the authentic, inclusive, and immersive global entertainment property at the epicenter of football fandom. We have amazing games, we've built around powerful IP, made by incredibly talented teams. We have a network of more than half a billion player accounts. We have outstanding engagement in our games and live services, fueled by social connection and shared experiences. With these strengths at our core, FY '23 is set to be a year of innovation, growth, and leadership for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand the call over to Chris. Chris Suh : Thanks, Andrew and good afternoon everyone. As Andrew said, FY '22 was a record year, with net bookings that exceeded $7.5 billion. This is more than $200 million ahead of original guidance, driven by growing player engagement across our broad portfolio of live services and games. We grew both net bookings and underlying profit by over 20% for the full year. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion, nearly $150 million above our original guidance, and we returned almost $1.5 billion to shareholders. These results speak to the power of our diverse portfolio, and to the durability and consistency of a live services business founded on deep player engagement. For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.75 billion, up 18% from the prior year, and reaching a new Q4 high, even with the action we took to cease sales in Russia and Belarus during the quarter. Live services net bookings grew 14% year-over-year. We delivered Q4 net revenue of over $1.8 billion, ahead of our expectations and up 36% year-over-year. Underlying profit was well above our expectations. Q4 operating expenses came in lower than our expectations, driven by the timing of some marketing and sales activities. We are continuing to prioritize our investments into our best long-term growth opportunities, while also remaining agile to realize cost savings and implement efficiencies where appropriate. We generated $444 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, let me talk about our full year performance. Live services net bookings grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $5.4 billion, and made up over 71% of our total business. Full game sales were up 34% to $2.1 billion. Our healthy live services growth was driven by strength across our broad-based portfolio, mostly notably by Apex Legends and FIFA. Apex Legends is up over 40% for the year, taking it past the $2 billion milestone in lifetime net bookings. Season 12 finished yesterday, and was the most successful ever. And, of course, Apex Legends Mobile is performing well in tests and is close to launch. FIFA 22 is the most successful FIFA ever, launch to date, with net bookings up double digits. Full game sales growth was similarly diverse, with Battlefield, FIFA 22, Madden NFL, It Takes Two, F1, and Mass Effect Legendary Edition all important contributors. On console, digital represented 65% of full game units sold through, up three percentage points from last year. In Mobile, we passed the billion-dollar milestone this year, with nearly $1.2 billion in net bookings. As a result of great work by our teams, our return on advertising spend is now roughly back where it was before the IDFA changes, and now we're looking to maintain that ROAS level as we scale spend back to the level it was before, and as we continue to learn and to adapt to market changes. Across our full portfolio, 12 titles contributed $100 million or more to net bookings in FY '22. Now, let me turn to FY '23. As Andrew laid out, we're entering the year from a position of strength. We're experiencing strong engagement across our live services, have great early indicators for our mobile launches, see continued momentum in our annual sports titles, and have a strong slate of console titles scheduled for the second half. We expect fiscal '23 net bookings to be $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% versus FY '22, driven by growth in live services, particularly in mobile, and supported by the strong launch slate in the second half. Three key drivers of mobile growth in FY ' 23 are : the launch of Apex Legends Mobile; growth in FIFA Mobile; and the launch of Lord of the Rings : Heroes of Middle-earth later in the year. FX is a headwind of nearly three points, net of hedges, relative to last year, for both net bookings and underlying profit, which puts our net bookings guidance in constant currency at 8% to 10%. Additionally, the impact of the stoppage of Russia sales is one percentage point to net bookings, and two points to underlying profits. Adjusted for these factors, we continue to see healthy underlying performance, which illustrates the durability of our portfolio of live services. We expect cost of revenue to be $2.020 to $2.065 billion, in part reflecting the anticipated strong growth of our mobile business. We expect operating expenses to be $4.200 to $4.315 billion. This is driven by investment in user acquisition for our two major mobile launches, and adding talent to our development teams to deliver the live services and title slates we have in development for FY '24, FY '25 and beyond. Also note that we've increased the management tax rate used by our long-term model from 18% to 19%, primarily due to U.S. tax rules published in January. We expect operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash, although the year-on-year number is down slightly, primarily due to timing, as our biggest non-sports launch is coming in Q4, with collections in FY '24, and also because our tax rate has increased. We continue to be committed to growing our cash return program, and announced today that we are increasing our dividend by 12%, from $0.17 to $0.19 per share, payable each quarter. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, and we will revisit it closer to the expiration in November of 2022. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a number of new game launches in Q1, whereas this Q1 is primarily live services, with only F1 22 launching on console and PC later this quarter. In contrast, this coming Q2 has a profile very similar to last year's Q2, with the launches of Madden and FIFA, plus some live services growth offset by some Ultimate Team net bookings phasing into Q3. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, cost of revenue to be $309 million to $321 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.013 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.85 for the first quarter. To conclude, EA delivered another record year, well ahead of our original guidance, driven by strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of titles. Looking forward, we are capitalizing on this strength to invest in our future. We expect to outgrow the market, to show resilience through uncertain times, building on the foundation of live services and our broad portfolio to deliver growth over the long-term. Now I'll hand the floor back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. As we kick off FY '23, we are investing for growth from a position of strength. With a portfolio of amazing IP, the best talent, and a growing network of highly engaged players, we are scaling to deliver new experiences, on more platforms, across more geographies. Our total addressable market is expanding, and secular trends are driving more consumption of interactive entertainment. Our games are deeply social, and we will continue to build on our strengths as we invest to grow our biggest franchises to connect with more players in the future. We have a clear vision, a clear strategy, and we have a spectacular team ready to deliver in FY '23 for hundreds of millions of players, viewers, and creators around the world. Now Chris and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Omar Dessouky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. It kind of looks like excluding the FX, you guys increased your guidance versus the mid- to high single digits, excluding the FX in Russia that is, versus the high mid-single digits that you had communicated on the third quarter call. First of all, is that the case? And second, has it become more clear since the third quarter call that the churn among gamers who joined during COVID lockdowns has run its course and that average revenue per paying user will remain near the highs seen during the pandemic as 2022 unfolds? Chris Suh : Great. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the first part first, and then I'll turn it over to Andrew, and he can comment as well on the second part of your question. So from a guidance perspective, we did -- your math is correct. Normalizing for the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which we articulated was three points on net bookings as well as the impact of the decision taken in Russia that effectively puts the equivalent guide more in the high single digits equivalency, which is slightly above the signal that we gave in the last earnings call. So it is indicative of how we finished the quarter with strong player engagement, and we feel good about the outlook. Andrew Wilson : And as it relates to player engagement and the value that we see from that over the course of time, I think what you've heard from us throughout COVID is that players sort out our games in the beginning for entertainment reasons, but they stay deeply engaged in them beyond just entertainment. They really saw games as a means of deep social connection with their atomic unit of friends. And this is not four or five friends that you spend a great deal of your social time with. What we have seen even as we are moving past COVID and that people are returning to work and returning to live and returning to school is our engagement has continued to be very, very strong, and in many cases, across some of our franchises at record levels. Given the level of entertainment that we're developing and delivering, given the value of social interaction as part of those experiences, we think this is going to be a continued driver for growth for us. Omar Dessouky : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. David Karnovsky : Hi, thank you. Andrew, just on the FIFA license. I was wondering if you could just discuss a little bit more the decision to forego that and how are you kind of thinking about potential risk given the brand shift, but then also the upside in terms of how ending the license kind of frees you up for certain revenue opportunities than in the past would have been restricted? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. And as you will have seen from our press release today and certainly I think FIFA affirms some things on their own website, we've been working through this. We're very excited about the future of football. We have, as you heard in the prepared remarks, over 300 licenses that deliver the content and form the experience that we deliver to players that's most meaningful for them. We've got over 150 million players across unique accounts. And so when we think about the future of football right now, we've really made this decision on the basis of being able to deliver experiences that our players wanted. They told, they wanted more modalities of play. They told us they wanted to see more commercial partners in the game that are representative and authentic to the broad global world of football. They're telling us they wanted to move beyond just the core experience and really build out this digital football experience. And they tell us they want to move really, really fast. And so as we move through this, again, we are deeply grateful of our relationship with FIFA for nearly 30 years and deeply respectful for the partnership. And we've worked closely together as two organizations to ensure that we can deliver the biggest FIFA this year that we've ever delivered, featuring World Cup content from both the Men's World Cup and the Women's World Cup for the first time ever. And we work to do that because we believe that's important to our fans. And beyond that, we're excited to work with our 300-plus partners and all the new partners that we're going to have the opportunity to work with to deliver what we believe will be the greatest digital football experience available and sit at the very epicenter of football fandom globally. David Karnovsky : Okay. Maybe just a follow-up, and I touched on it a little bit, but how do you think specifically about marketing the EA SPORTS FC brand? And would there be initial bump in advertising costs? Or could you just mostly take advantage of that lack of a license fee? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I think it's a little early to tell yet. We're certainly being very thoughtful and deliberate about that. The important thing to understand though is that as you travel around the world and you meet with players who really are deeply engaged with our game, for a player in the U.K., the most important thing to them is the Premier League. For a player in Germany, the most important thing to them is the Bundesliga league. And Spain is La Liga and so on and so forth as you go around the world. What we're focused on right now is building very unique experiences for each of those fans in each of those markets. And what you've seen today is many of our partners come out in support of our ability to do this for our fans. And so certainly, any time you change the name of a product, you must be very thoughtful and we'll certainly have to think about marketing that front. But what gives us confidence as we move into this next phase of growth is that we are working with the partners and the content that our fans love and relate to most directly in the markets in which they do it. David Karnovsky : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Benjamin Soff : Hi, thanks for the question guys. I wanted to dig into the mobile business a bit. You've got Apex on Mobile coming out soon. The FIFA Mobile rebound seems to be doing really well. You announced the new Lord of the Rings game and doing some other stuff on the sports side. So really, the question is how are you guys thinking about the mobile growth opportunity in general. And how has your outlook changed, if at all, since giving that longer-term growth target for the business last year? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes, great question. I mean we remain very excited about the opportunity in mobile. It continues to be the single biggest gaming platform in the world with a TAM of 3.5 billion players. And so that's just -- to have that kind of TAM access is just extraordinary for us as game makers and delivering live services to that audience. We're seeing really good metrics around Apex Legends right now in test, and that will launch later this year. FIFA had its biggest quarter ever. They had a surge of 80% in users. And Lord of the Rings is coming from what has been our strongest mobile studio capital games who build these type of games and have done so well for us and have such an avid fan following. So as we think about moving forward in mobile, we think that the brands that we have, the expertise that we have, that we've built organically internally and that we've acquired through recent mobile acquisitions represents a really strong opportunity for us over the long term. Remember, when you launch these games, they last for 5-plus years as live services. And what you're seeing this year is three big launches for us in addition to our existing portfolio, which is incredibly strong, and we're going to invest behind that for the long term. Benjamin Soff : Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on F1. I believe this upcoming title is the first game in the series that you guys really were able to put your fingerprints on since the acquisition. So can you talk a little bit more about your plans for the franchise, the types of innovation you're bringing to the game? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And that team is an extraordinary team and has always built an incredibly high-quality game, and that was really the impetus for the acquisition to bring that into the EA SPORTS brand portfolio. F1, as you may have seen, if you follow the sport is an all-time high in fandom we had, an extraordinary season last year between Hamilton and Verstappen. We're seeing an incredible season this year with Ferrari leading in the Constructor's Championship and Leclerc and others really pushing Verstappen. And so in our world, if you get to a place where sports fandom is high in engagement and the core sport is high, and then you couple that with an extraordinary development team who have a history and track record of building extremely high-quality products and then you layer in EA SPORTS marketing power and global reach, we think there's incredible opportunity there, and we think that business is going to go from strength to strength. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Eric Handler : Good evening, and thanks for the question. I'm curious to think about the marketing investment that you're going to be spending on Apex Legends for mobile and then you got Lord of the Rings and you're still in the relatively early stages with FIFA for mobile. Should we be thinking about the investment sort of negating a lot of the revenue that comes in from these titles and really, you look to grow the player base in fiscal '23 and then you think about margin expansion in fiscal '24? Andrew Wilson : I think that's a good way to think about it. The reality is any time we develop a game and launch a game, there is a combination of development cost and marketing cost to kind of get to launch and get to that critical mass of players at a sequencing of that. It's very different in mobile than it is in traditional console experiences. Traditional console experience, of course, you can spend in development for two, three, four, in some cases, five years, and there's an exceptional amount of development spend upfront. And then the marketing spend proportion of that is much lower. In mobile, the cost of development is lower to get to launch. The acquisition spend early on to supercharge a new launch is higher. But remember, these are live services. And what we're doing is we're driving a golden cohort at the beginning of the launch, and that cohort will continue to deliver a return that we build on over time for the course of the next five plus years. And so early on, you see margin compression in the context of mobile. Over the course of time, you see margin accretion and margin expansion and these live services become global communities of players that continue to play for five plus years and in some cases, as long as a decade. Chris Suh : Yes. Maybe I could just add on to that, Eric. As you have a chance to go through your -- the model and the guidance that we gave, you'll see that is implied in that -- in the guidance and the cost structure, it is the points that -- to reiterate the points that Andrew made, we're excited about our opportunity in mobile. It represents an enormous TAM opportunity. We're excited about what we have in store for this year. It is a different margin profile, especially in the short term. But as Andrew pointed out, once we get to scale, we see great profit -- revenue and profit opportunity, and we're really excited about the opportunity you had. Eric Handler : Great. And then just as a follow-up, I believe you said, Andrew, six new sports titles this year. I wonder if you could give a little color on that. Are these mobile titles? Are these new PC console games? What can you tell us there? Andrew Wilson : So it's the cast of characters that you would expect from us, plus F1, so we would stretch our FIFA product, that's NHL, that's Madden NFL, that's F1. We've got a new golf game. I'm trying to think now, you've caught me off guard -- and super mega baseball, which was an acquired property. So yes, so -- and that's across console, PC and in some cases, mobile. Eric Handler : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead Drew Crum : Hi guys. Good afternoon. I want to drill down a little bit more on Apex Legends. You're lapping a 40%-plus comp but also launching on mobile. What are your expectations for franchise net bookings in fiscal '23? And will you make any changes to the cadence of live services or content drops across the franchise now that it will be on mobile? Thanks. Chris Suh : Yes. No, it's a great question. Thank you for the question. As you rightly pointed out, Apex Legends had a terrific year in FY '22. We're across both financial metrics, but also all the player engagement data that Andrew spoke to. And so we're really excited about how we finished the year, coming out of that with a lot of momentum. We do have profitable growth planned again in FY '23. It's a large franchise for us. It's a big business. And so we'll see continued growth on that on the console and on the HD side. In addition to that, with the Apex mobile launch, we are anticipating this to be one of the most exciting launches that we've had on mobile ever. And so the combination of that indicates a lot of optimism and strength for the Apex mobile or Apex Legends business all up. Andrew Wilson : And in terms of the cadence of content drops and experience updates and events, again, the Respawn team and the Apex team have demonstrated over the course of the last two plus years an extraordinary connection with their community. And they've been able to figure out exactly when and how to make drops and things that the community wants and needs. And so we don't have a hard and fast rule in terms of which drops will happen when. We really allow the team to work deep with the community. But I think as you -- as the franchise continues to grow and as we move on mobile and launch and grow on a global basis, I think it's reasonable to believe that over the course of time, there will be more and more content launched into the world and a new season starting today, which off the back of a record season 12, we expect will continue to do well. I know Newcastle is a new legend is why the game is going to be one of the great legends inside the game experience. Drew Crum : Thank you, guys. Chris Suh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please go ahead. Colin Sebastian : Thanks everyone. Good afternoon, and welcome, Chris. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question, first off. I guess there may be some changes to the release of Legends going forward on Apex. So curious how you think that might impact engagement or each of the contributions from stories going forward. And then the question -- the other question is despite these results, I wonder, Andrew, what you think the impact has been on growth from the persistent short supplies of consoles and GPU chips, et cetera? And what's also factored in the outlook from that perspective? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So let me touch on the first two and then I'll let Chris take the outlook piece. Again, I think that each time the team releases new content, new events, we see growing engagement and have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to really understand the things that are going to drive ongoing engagement for our community. So I wouldn't expect that we would see any decline in engagement with more content, quite the opposite. I think as we go to more platforms and we build out our engagement model over the course of time, I think that we'll see a growing audience, and I think we'll see growing engagement. And that has been our experience so far. In terms of supply chain shortages, again, we've just come off a record year. We beat on almost every measure, even in the face of what is almost certainly supply chain shortages around consoles and chipsets and graphics cards and these types of things. It's hard to know how much bigger that would be. I have to imagine with more consoles out there and more PCs and more graphics cards that our results may have been even better, but we're very happy with the results we had, and we look forward to as supply chain issues start to ease and more consoles end up in the marketplace and more graphics cards and more PC availability that more games have access to higher-quality machines, and that ultimately will drive engagement for us. If you go back through the course of time, at each platform transition, at each technology evolution, the gaming TAM and the gaming community broadly has grown. And so I think this only represents upside for us. Chris Suh : I'll just add on to Andrew's good summation. From a market standpoint, from the composition of our business, I think this is one of the things that really sort of illustrates the resilience of the live services business model, which with 71% of our business -- or over 71% of our business in FY '22, and it will grow as a share of our business next year with -- especially with the launches of mobile. And so from one standpoint, we feel good about that. And that's all embedded into the guide that you heard us talk about at length. Specific to the console market, we are anticipating Gen 5 console units to be up year-on-year, and that will also be an added tailwind to the business all in all. Colin Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Pardon me, your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Andrew Wilson : Charlie, I think he dropped off the line. So we can move to the next one. Operator : Sure. No problem, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Matthew Thornton : Hi, good afternoon, Andrew and Chris. A couple of interrelated ones, if I could. I'm going to ask a question that was asked earlier but in a little bit of a different way. Since you guys talked about mid- to high single-digit bookings growth last quarter, as you've alluded to, there's a lot of incremental headwinds. So my first question is, is there anything that's changed in the fleet as you think about fiscal '23 versus kind of what you were thinking three months ago? That's question one. Question number two, the slate talked about a major IP in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious if there's a reason why that would fit better in fiscal 4Q as opposed to the traditional holiday quarter in 3Q where you typically might put a big piece of IP. Any thoughts there? And then just finally on -- maybe, Andrew, you could talk a little bit about just the work-from-home transition to back to office, how that's playing into productivity and how that maybe gives you confidence that you could kind of release these titles because you do have quite a few in the back half of the year, including in 4Q. So I'm just curious your level of comfort with that based on what you're seeing in the productivity trends. Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Okay. So there was a lot in there. Chris Suh : Three parts. Andrew Wilson : I think the first one was do we anticipate slight change as an additional element as we kind of have got from third quarter through fourth quarter. The short answer is no. We continue to believe our slate is strong. I think the second question was we've got a major IP in the fourth quarter and why not do that in the holiday quarter. And I would say two things to that. One is we want to get to the highest quality games we possibly can. We're committed to quality. We're committed to giving our development teams all the time they need to build great games and deliver those through a global audience. Underlying that, I'd also highlight, though, that the nature of our business is changing. As Chris pointed out, 71% of our business is coming from live services. And so these traditional launch windows that have been so important in our industry for the longest time aren't as relevant now in a world where players are playing our games day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out. And so the combination of the changing nature of engagement consumption of our games and our deep desire to give our teams all the time they need to get to the best possible game experience really is what's driving that Q4 launch. And then I think the last part of your question was around work-from-home and how is that looking, and I would say, it's still early. We're seeing more and more people back into offices Again, there are still waves of COVID out there, and we're seeing some rising numbers in certain geographies. And good news is, is the severity of infection or the severity of symptoms from infections seems to be much lower than the initial waves and phase of COVID. So I think that's good just for humanity broadly. And certainly, we're seeing a return to office kind of moving through its general iteration. In terms of confidence that I have in launching the games through the year, I have strong confidence largely because having done this for two years, we launched more content than any other developer and publisher video games through this time. And our teams have demonstrated unbelievable tenacity and unbelievable wherewithal. And we've really harnessed the power of our platform technology to continue to deliver games even while working from home. So as people come back together, we get to see more collaboration. I think things get easier. But even if that ends up being a little slower than we would hope, given the ingenuity of our teams, I still have strong confidence in our ability to launch our full slate of high-quality titles this year. I think that was all of them. Chris Suh : I think you got them. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Mike Hickey : Hi, guys. Andrew, and Chris, and Chris, great result, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First question, I guess, just on the economy here. It's been a while, I think, Andrew, has been the business has sort of been captured with our recession. So whether or not we going recession, who knows? How do you think about [technical difficulty] player fee closing up now that pretty much service versus premium digital versus [technical difficulty]. Would you imagine a sort of mix shift, if we do have recession here or pullback in discretionary spend towards free-to-play? Just sort of guess the puts and takes on your clarity and then how you factor that into your guidance? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you, guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes. There was a little jumble, Mike. I'm sorry, but I think that the gist of the question was with the macroeconomic climate out there, and I think you mentioned the notion of recession, how do we think about that? How do we think about building our plan and probably specifically you're thinking around OpEx. I think -- and Chris can weigh in here as well. We've been very thoughtful about this as we're embarking on the year ahead. And certainly, there are people way smarter than us who were kind of predicting what will be the macroeconomic outcome over the course of time. Here's what we see. We see we're coming out of a year with record performance. We're seeing our network grow dramatically and engagement grow dramatically. And we're seeing our games used not just for entertainment, but also for social interaction and social connection. We -- so that gives us confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business over the long term. As we look back over previous times where there may have been challenged consumer spending, our industry now games specifically have actually done very, very well for two reasons. One, entertainment really is a fundamental human need. And two, the form of entertainment that we deliver is extremely high value to consumers, given that you get thousands of hours of engagement when you play one of our games. And so our expectation is that even in an environment of macro challenge that our industry now games will continue to do well. One of the other things that we have -- where we've gone back and really looked at this, though, and you study it, is you discover that companies that can invest from a position of strength going into an environment like the one seemingly we're moving into actually benefit disproportionately as you come out of that. And so I think if you take in the fact that we have a growing network, growing engagement, record performance, our games fulfill both entertainment and social interaction than if you look back in history, our industry has performed very well at times like this. And when you take the strength of our business and our ability to invest against new titles this year, as well as titles we developed for the out years, we feel like we've put ourselves in a really strong position even if we were going into a challenging macro headwind. With that being said, we have built flexibility in the plan. You should know that we will be extraordinarily disciplined around costs as we move through this. And that should there be something unforeseen to us, that we have levers in our model that will allow us to adjust. But we do believe it is behest of us to invest from a position of strength as we go into this market. Mike Hickey : Thank you. Chris Suh : Well, I think, well, everything, but that was good. Mike Hickey : Whole day, okay. Sounds good. Second question, Microsoft, hope you can hear me. Microsoft and Sony were sort of flirting -- at least that was the rumor flirting with the idea of adding advertisements into free-to-play game experiences maybe as a way to sort of help developers monetize their player community. And of course, you guys -- you go way back to Burnout Paradise to sort of impetus for trying the idea on the billboards in that game. So obviously, this idea has created a lot of debate within the player community. But just sort of curious your thoughts on whether or not ad monetization and free-to-play games is something that you think can be meaningful and then how you sort of balance that with the player experience. Thanks, guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes. And so for us, I think you finish there where we start, which is the player experience. We want to ensure that the player experience is the best possible player experience that we can provide. And that's why you've seen us kind of test various models over the course of time, some have continued and some we have stopped on the basis of really upholding the best possible player experience we can. What we've seen generally though in entertainment media and even in games, particularly in mobile games right now, you see that there is a place for advertising when done right. And there is a portion of the community that when given the choice will participate in advertising where it benefits their gameplay experience. I think we've learned some of this from Glu as we brought Glu organization, and we've seen this across the industry. And so you should expect that we would continue to kind of test different things, ensuring first and foremost, that we uphold the best possible player experience. But where there is an audience -- but given the choice we'd like to engage with advertising, they have the ability to do so, we want to make that available to them. Mike Hickey : Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the FIFA title this year. I believe you guys are already testing cross-play support FIFA 22. So I presume that next year the '23. So what is the impact of profit actually of player engagement? And then similarly, can you remind us what the magnitude of uplift was from including a World Cup mode within FIFA? Andrew Wilson : Let me start on the World Cup mode with FIFA. And again, in the context of live service, we're always balancing the investment of time and the investment of dollars from the community. And at any given point in time, based on what's going on in the world of that game and in this case, in the world of football and of the gameplay community, we will look to leverage new content and new events and new experiences either to drive greater engagement and provide new interesting things for players to do or it might be a monetization opportunity. You might recall the last time we did the World Cup, it was an extraordinary engagement opportunity. And I don't have the numbers at the tip of my fingers. But if I remember rightly, we brought 12 million or 13 million people back into the game who had lapsed out of the game through World Cup content and drove incredible engagement through the event and then, of course, as part of the ongoing live service, continue to grow the business over the course of time. We will think about it this year in the same context. We're always thinking about our player community and always thinking about the balance between the investment of time and the investment of dollars, all in service of a more positive and more immersive and a more entertaining player experience. In terms of the value of cross-play, I don't think we have any specific data on that yet out of FIFA. In other franchises is certainly where you get greater liquidity in the franchise and friends can play with each other across devices. That's always a good thing for players. But remember, in our FIFA experience, which has 30-plus million people playing across console and PC, it's already a highly liquid community and every platform already has more enough players to sustain the ongoing player experience. But certainly, as we think about the future of all of our franchises, we want to get to a place where the entire community can play together, and that will be part of our driver as we move forward. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks, Andrew. And then just one on Battlefield, I was just curious if there's any updates on that franchise. I know you guys previously mentioned you're willing to kind of invest more into the franchise in the long term. But has that mindset changed in the past few weeks given the lack of resurgence from the last update? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : No. And again, we take a long view here. This is one of the great franchises in our industry, built by one of the great teams in our industry. And our expectation is that we'll continue to grow and be a really important part of our portfolio for many, many years to come. We've got incredible leadership over that team now. They're rethinking the development process from the ground up and really using kind of the Vince Zampella/Respawn model of get to the fun as quickly as possible. They've been doing thousands of updates for the community working on quality of life and really getting the core game right. I think there's still more work for us to do there, and the team is committed to doing that work for the community. And beyond that, once we get to a place where we feel like we're in the right place with the core experience and with the core game, then you should expect us to invest and grow beyond where the game is at today. Mario Lu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen. Please go ahead. Doug Creutz : Hi, thanks. I think on the last call, you'd indicated that the Battlefield mobile game was close to going into Closed Beta. And at least at one point, you seem to indicate it might be a fiscal '23 launch. Can you just kind of update on where that is, how the Closed Beta go? And how you're feeling about timing for the title at this point? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Right now, I think we're looking at going into further testing at the end of May and then subject to the metrics and the data that we've seen and the engagement they see, we might look toward the end of this year, beginning of next year for a global launch. Remember, in mobile, it all really comes down to the tuning and balancing once we go into kind of that Closed Beta phase. We don't have any money in FY '23 right now against that title. So if it was to launch in the year, that would be an upside potential for us. And we want to give ourselves the opportunity to ensure that we -- the game has all the soft launch and Closed Beta that it needs in order to tune and balance. But having played the game, I can tell you, I think that we're excited for the potential. Doug Creutz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Bass with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Jamie Bass : Hello guys, and thanks for taking my questions. I just got a couple if that's okay. Firstly, you were talking about the sort of positive metrics within mobile coming back to the levels that were pre-IDFA. Two things on that. Firstly, could you give us sort of an indication of what your expectations are for the key core franchises as in not bringing in Apex mobile and you already had within the mobile franchise. And then second question is on the more boring topics on developer cost inflation, wage inflation. Do you have sort of an outlook for what you're expecting this year in terms of new hires, whether you're expecting a certain percentage in terms of how much actually you need to pay to bring on new developers? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Maybe I'll start with the second one, and then we'll move back to the first one. Certainly, I think that competition for great talent has always been incredibly high in our industry, and that's no different now. When we think about hiring new talent and we talk to candidates, they really make employment decisions based on four key vectors : what is the work they're going to do; who are the people they're going to do it with, of course, what is going to be the conversation; and their opportunity to learn and grow. And as we lean into hiring, we're really leaning to all four of those vectors and try and create a culture where this is a great place to make games. We were able to hire a record numbers in FY '22, even amidst what was already a very competitive marketplace. We expect to continue hiring., I think that we've been recognized by a number of surveys as an extraordinary place to work and we've really focused on the culture of our company and ensuring that we are a great place to come and create games. That doesn't mean we won't be challenged in the marketplace. I think it's going to be more and more challenged. But so far, we have not had trouble hiring incredible talent, and we brought in some amazing new creators and people across our business, quite frankly, through FY '22. Chris Suh : And on your question specifically, as I commented in my comments in my prepared remarks about the IDFA changes, it is something we're still working through. We have seen some positive movement toward reaching related levels pre-IDFA, and we feel optimistic that we're sort of through the tougher part of it, and we feel good about the outlook from here. Chris Evenden : And that brings us to the end of\u2026 Andrew Wilson : Okay. Could I just? Chris Evenden : Okay. Go ahead, sorry. Andrew Wilson : I'll catch up with you afterwards. So that was just going to say that brings us to the end of the call today. So thanks, everyone, for your time, and we look forward to speaking to you in the next quarter. Chris Suh : Thank you so much. Chris Evenden : Thank you, all. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Evenden : Thank you. Welcome to EA's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Chris Suh, our CFO; and Laura Miele, our COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q2 fiscal 2023 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, November 1st. As a reminder, we post the schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 10, 2022, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Chris. It\u2019s great to be here with you all. We delivered a strong performance across our business in Q1. Our broad IP portfolio, our amazing talent, and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services all serve as unique structural advantages, especially as we navigate the fluidity of the macro environment. While we recognize there is more uncertainty in the market, our teams are focused on what they do best, delivering amazing games and services that keep our players engaged, connected, and inspired as we take entertainment and play to the next level. Our portfolio of sports and owned IP franchises continues to power resilience and longevity in our business. EA SPORTS & Racing is a growth center, with franchises that are at the heart of how sports fandom is becoming increasingly interactive. F1 22 sales are up double-digits launch to-date, as the sport continues to boom, especially with younger fans. Our EA SPORTS FIFA franchise is exceptionally strong on a global basis, with record business for Q1 in Asia, significant growth in mobile with DAUs up another 10% over last quarter, and FUT engagement growing nearly 40% year-over-year, which is well above the industry average. We\u2019re going from strength-to-strength in EA SPORTS, including Madden NFL 23 just weeks away, and our most expansive FIFA game ever coming this fall. Sports is the ultimate evergreen form of entertainment, and our new cross-media partnership with LaLiga perfectly illustrates how we continue to innovate at the forefront of sport, media, and interactive content. With these multi-faceted collaborations, we are able bring the most authentic experiences to fans and expand into new ways to watch, create, compete, connect and participate in sport -- across platforms, business models, and geographies. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is a leading multi-platform franchise, with our live service on console and PC driving massive ongoing engagement and a new mobile game that is delivering on our early expectations. Engagement in our Sims franchise is also outperforming the market with content that resonates for a broad and diverse audience. We have a proven ability to grow successful long-term live services across our portfolio with ongoing engagement that drives resiliency, reoccurring revenue and lifetime value for our business. Through all of these experiences, our large global network has grown to nearly 600 million. Every day, our players are forging new friendships and social connections. And with the scale of our network and our team's ability to utilize our data, we can understand where, how and what our audiences are playing today and where they want to go next. We continue to see Gen Alpha and Gen Z turning to games as their primary form of entertainment, consuming more content than any generation of the past. They love playing with friends, they stay connected with family and they're creating content at every turn, both in and around their entire gaming experience, whether they play games from our expansive EA SPORTS portfolio to fuel their fandom, enjoy the intensity and competition of Apex Legends, or seek adventure in games such as Star Wars Jedi, the next generations of consumers use the power of play to fully immerse and express themselves, to build deeper, more meaningful connections with the communities they identify with and where they feel they belong. They're using games like the Sims to unleash their personal and creative autonomy, building characters and new stories with their friends. Delivering games that fuel creativity where players can join, compete and interact with each other through social and immersive experiences is an exciting growth lever for Electronic Arts, as we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio and build global online communities spanning more geographies. Games are the social networks of the future. Leading in this highly competitive market requires a strong focus on people. We continue to invest in our culture and in fueling our talent pipeline. The best character artists, animators, graphic designers, data scientists, engineers and many more talent creators are all joining our team to level up their careers with award winning franchises and studios. From career development and wellness programs to workplace experiences and technology that inspires collaboration and innovation, we strive to make Electronic Arts a great place to work and grow. Through our IP, our talent and our growing network of players, we are adding strength and long-term value to our business. Even with short-term uncertainties, interactive entertainment will continue to evolve and grow, and we are in a very strong position. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Suh : Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, we had another strong quarter driven by continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio of live services and games. Net bookings for the first quarter exceeded our expectations, coming in at $1.3 billion, driven by our FIFA franchise and the F1 22 launch. Compared to the prior year, net bookings were down 3% or 1% in constant currency, driven by two game launches last year compared to one this year, offset by strength in the FIFA franchise, the acquisition of Playdemic and the launch of Apex Legends Mobile. Our live services net bookings grew 8% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, again, demonstrating the resiliency of the highly reoccurring revenue stream. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 65% of units sold through, up four percentage points from last year. We delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.77 billion, also above our expectations. And with the higher mix of console-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were also well above our expectations. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise during the quarter, particularly with FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. FIFA Online 4 hit new high engagement and FIFA Mobile delivered its biggest net bookings quarter ever. FIFA 22 is the largest FIFA ever, life to date with regard to net bookings. F1 2022 net bookings also materially outperformed our expectations, and the franchise has become a dependable driver of growth, having delivered double-digit growth for each of the last four years. Andrew highlighted the success of our owned-IP games, exemplified by Apex Legends, which saw double-digit net bookings growth again in Q1. Apex Legends Mobile had a successful launch during the quarter, making Apex Legends a leading multi-platform global franchise. Operating expenses were up 11% on last year, in line with our expectations, as we continue to invest in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $78 million, and we returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining our full year net bookings guidance of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% year-on-year, or 8% to 11% in constant currency. Let me give a bit more color within this range. First, based on current exchange rates, we see nearly $100 million of incremental net bookings headwind within our full year guidance, or about one point of growth, which mostly impacts the second half of our year. As rates remain quite volatile, we will provide a more current update in our Q2 earnings call about the expected half two impact. Second, we\u2019re seeing some shifts within our business. We expect the strong Q1 results in our EA SPORTS and Racing portfolio to continue, offsetting the anticipated impact of an overall softer mobile market. This mix shift has a positive benefit to gross margins, and therefore minimizes the likely increased impact of FX on our underlying profitability. We expect fiscal 2023 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and cost of revenue to be $2.02 billion to $2.065 billion. Our expectations for operating expenses are unchanged, at $4.2 billion to $4.315 billion, and we anticipate earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. Our guidance for operating cash flow also remains unchanged, at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter, we expect Q2 fiscal 2023 net bookings to be $1.725 to $1.775 billion, driven by the launch of Madden 23 on August 19 and FIFA 23 on September 30. Both Madden and FIFA benefit from having built decades-long relationships with their passionate player communities and broader sports ecosystems, and we\u2019re seeing strong pre-launch momentum for these reliably well-performing titles. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $467 million to $480 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.036 billion to $1.041 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.86 for the quarter. Our strong first quarter reflects the continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio. We're confident in our ability to execute with discipline, navigating through a more uneven market with a robust half two slate, and the durable power of our live services model to deliver continued growth in fiscal 2023. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. It's been a good start to the year. While the macro outlook remains fluid, every one of us at Electronic Arts is focused on the things we can control. Even amidst market uncertainty, more people than ever before are turning to games as the primary choice for entertainment. This is what they love to do more than anything else, and it's how they want to connect and share experiences with people around the world. With gaming so central to our lives today, EA is uniquely well positioned with a broad demographic reach of our portfolio and the strongest content pipeline in our history. Leveraging the talent of the best teams in the industry, we are poised to lead this next chapter of entertainment and to continue building long-term value in our company. As we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I want to take a moment to welcome Laura Miele. As Chief Operating Officer, Laura has a deep connection to our business from game creation and our studios to revenue generation and our commercial organization. Laura will join us to add her strategic perspective and insights on the business. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Hope everyone in the team is well. Maybe two big picture questions, if I can, Andrew. First, with where we are in the console cycle and how there still continues to be a lot of supply chain and logistic challenges globally, can you talk a little bit about your current thinking on this console cycle versus historical precedents and how you plan on sort of building the organization on the content side to [line] (ph) when we get to sort of mass deployment of the next-generation of consoles? Would love your view on that first. And then obviously, on the mobile gaming side, we continue to see a lot of challenges on distribution and go-to-market and monetization. Can you talk a little bit about your efforts to realign the organization for this sort of new world order for mobile and how you think about capitalizing on that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks so much. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. Thanks, Eric. Two great questions. I'm going to get a bunch I'm going to hand off to Laura a little bit on mobile structure. She's been working very closely with the team on how we're thinking about that future. In terms of console cycle, first, we're still really early in this console cycle. So our expectation, typically, our console partners think about console cycles on a 10-year time horizon. And so we're still really early. And while there are some supply chain constraints, I think what we're hearing from our partners is that we feel like they're going to ease up towards the back half and certainly into next year. But the most important thing that we're seeing is demand is off the charts. And I think we heard Microsoft say they're in as good a position as they've ever been in terms of their console sales and their console demand. And we also know that Sony consoles are in deep demand. And as the supply chain starts to ease, our expectation is that more and more people pick up that next console. So as we think about what is the next 8 years of this cycle, you should expect that we'll continue to invest deeply in our existing owned IP in our EA SPORTS portfolio, but you should also expect that as we get through that cycle, we're investing deeper into our slate to have a stronger pipeline down the back half of the cycle. And the good news about that for gamers is when we have a cycle that goes for this long and we're able to invest on this time horizon, the quality of the software and the nature of the experience we are able to deliver gets better every single year. And so, we're looking at this in the same way we have in the past. Now I think your next question on mobile is also a really important one, because what we also know, as these cycles continue, is mobile plays a big part, PC continues to play a big part. Over time, cloud gaming will also play a big part. And so, we're layering other mechanisms for this global community of 3.5 billion people who currently play games to interact with the content and services we provide. At a macro level, mobile continues to be the world's largest gaming platform, 3.5 billion people. It's hard to imagine any other platform having that kind of reach. For us, we also see that it gives us reach in markets where we typically haven't been as strong. And as we've talked about, our FIFA mobile business growing on mobile, we've actually seen the majority of that growth happened in markets where typically we have not been able to monetize that experience in the same way, given the limited penetration of consoles or the premium model in those markets. So long term, we continue to believe that mobile is going to represent an incredibly strong opportunity for us, for -- on a global basis, about 50% of the gaming industry, it's about 17% of our business. So that represents tremendous upside for us. And so what Laura has really been working with the team on, particularly with our most recent acquisitions, is how can we build one single mobile organization that's really targeted at the future, a future where brands really matter, network really matters and incredible teams really matter. And I'd hand off to Laura to add a little bit more detail. Laura Miele : Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Eric, for the question. We have successfully integrated Glu and Playdemic into business into one mobile organization that is actually seeing growth year-over-year, and we continue to expect to see that in the coming years. As Andrew mentioned, there's an outside strategic value that mobile brings to our portfolio. It has a significant contribution and impact on the ecosystems of our big franchises. So one example, we've discussed the success of FIFA Mobile. And when we look at our player profile, 46% of our FIFA mobile players were located in Asia Pacific and Latin America compared to just 28% for our HD players. So we see this as a significant expansion of the overall ecosystem for these big brands that we have. It's also an amazing entry point for one of the largest growth drivers for us with Gen Z and Gen Alpha players. And of course, as Andrew mentioned, it's a dominant engagement platform for emerging markets. And then as we think about cross-platform play also for our franchises. So we are optimistic, not just about the individual mobile business, but the strategic impact mobile brings to our overall growth plans that we have for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on Chris' commentary for a softer mobile market in the back half. I think that's how I heard it. Can you maybe just walk through some of the drivers of that? Is that something specifically in your pipeline or is that more related to broader factors like the economy or UA challenges at some of the platforms? Andrew Wilson : Yes. I think we're seeing some macro mobile slowdown, at least that's what we're hearing about. Our model establishes -- is built on a basis that we'll see some slowdown in the macro mobile market. Again, our mobile business on balance is doing very well inside of this. And so we're confident in our core business. And we're confident in our core franchises. But we are seeing kind of a macro slowdown. I think there's, probably a few different reasons for that. One is I think the market is still working through IDFA and how to deal with that. Again, in a world that we have brands that matter and a strong network of players an incredible technology. We feel like that we're able to navigate that very well. Two, I think we're dealing with some tough COVID comps, mobile benefited greatly through COVID. And three, if you've traveled it all over the summer, I think the world is on vacation. And so if you speak to any of the travel companies, they will tell you they're seeing unprecedented levels of travel. And I think that might also have some impact. Long-term, though, when we come back to this, it represents 3.5 billion players. It represents a way for us to access players in markets that our traditional does not. We think that the future is going to lend itself to big important entertainment brands and brands that exist across platforms. And we think the overall ecosystem will be strong. And so, while we never want to go into a market overly confident. We always want to use strong discipline with how we plan for the market. We're confident in our business. But even as we hear about some softness in the market, we just want to account for that as we move into the second half of the year. David Karnovsky : Okay. Maybe I can just also follow up with one about economic risk more broadly. I think we've tended to think historically PC console games is kind of recession resistant just given the cup cost on a per hour basis of the content. But wondering, how you think that kind of dynamic holds up today, just given the industry has shifted so much towards live services, but then also increasing player engagement for things like subscription. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. I think it's a great question. Typically, as we've looked through past macro challenges, our industry has done extremely well relative to everything else that's going on around it, even relative to other forms of entertainment. There's, a few reasons for that. One, it's highly interactive and it's deeply engaging and represents extraordinary value for money. Two, entertainment is kind of a fundamental human need. And even as humanity is dealt with many challenges through its course, entertainment has always risen to the top is something that has brought us together. As we think about the business now versus the last macro challenges that we may have faced, I think the good news with live services is that we have more people engaging in our games for more time and more deeply connected to each other. All of those things speak to, I think, real strength of the nature of the live service business that we operate in today. I think there is one open question if we were to have one which is in a world where you can engage deeply without spending, how we will see spending through this period, in the connects of live services. What I said in the prepared remarks is, what we're focused on is the things that we can really control, which is driving deep engagement, because what we know about engagement in our business, particularly in the context of our live services, is over the lifetime of an experience. If we can, continue to drive really strong engagement across the portfolio and across our $600 million strong community, but the lifetime that we protected overtime. David Karnovsky : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open. Andrew Uerkwitz : Hey, great. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions here. The first one, probably for Laura, but just generally, COVID obviously impacted the way people played gains, but it also impacted greatly how games were being made. We've seen a ton of -- a lot of delays in the industry. Where do you think we're at? Are we to a point where delays will become fewer and fewer? Like how do you feel about making games today in the current environment? Laura Miele : Hi Andrew, thanks for the question, really great question. A couple of things. Yes, we did see initially some disruptions in how our teams make games. But I will say, and I've said so many times, I am just blown away by the ingenuity and creativity of our teams and how they have adapted to get to not only a more productive place but a highly creative place and how they're creating games. And so we've seen a lot of progress actually in how the rhythm and how our teams have created operating systems and processes around how to create games. And that said, we are seeing more people come back to the office. We are here in our office and our headquarters right now in person. And so -- and we've been traveling around visiting studios. Andrew was in the UK last week visiting our Racing teams there. So we're seeing more people come back. And we're also seeing people adapt to productivity and environments that are more meaningful and productive for them and for their creativity. So I would say that what we've learned is that having people and teams in place in the beginning of a production cycle for development. And then usually, at the end as we final has become critical. And our teams have adapted incredibly well on the production side, sometimes it's more meaningful for them to be in the office together and sometimes they are more productive from home. So we're seeing a really strong adaptation to how the teams are developing. So we believe we are in our new rhythm, and we're continuing to evolve that as time goes on. We also have seen a really strong demand in people joining our company. People choose to work with companies that they have a strong value and moral attachments to as well as clearly compensation is really important, but people really want to have a connection emotional and personal connection to where they are. And we've seen a really strong demand and desire to work here. So we're seeing a really good options for us to bring new talent in, and we're seeing our teams and infrastructure adapt to a new work environment. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. No, I really appreciate that color, Laura. Switching over to thinking about medium to long-term growth. You guys, I believe, I mean, you've announced or we've speculated that there's quite a few single player games coming. How should we think about growth from that vector? Should these be bigger in scale, so that they'll each kind of comp one after another nicely, or is it a quantity game where you launch one big one, and then we get a couple after that. How should we think about comping the single player games going forward as we build our models over the next couple of years? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah. And maybe Chris could add some detail on the model. The way we think about this is really less about, which game and more about, which motivations to these games fulfill. So we know about our players is on balance, they have these call motivations, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, self-improvement, creation, these things that bring us together as players of games. And the creation of worlds and the building of characters and the telling of stories is really important in the fulfillment of some of those motivations. So when we think about our portfolio and we think about building it out, we really think about it on two key vectors. One, how can we tell incredible stories and two, how can we build tremendous online communities and then how do we bring those two things together. So the way -- when you look at our portfolio, what you should be looking for is how are we doing that? How we build in these worlds and telling new stories, how we're developing global online communities and how we're bringing those two things together for the fulfillment of motivations. And what we see when we get that is one, we grow network until we grow the amount of time that plays in our network spend in and around our games. And as we think about single-player games, we think it's a really, really important part of the overall portfolio that we deliver in the fulfillment of those core motivations. And the way we'll plan for it over time is really just looking at our community and looking at how they're spending their time and looking at where motivations may or may not be fulfilled and we'll look to supplement that with the addition of new online games, new multi-player games and new single-player games. Chris Suh : Yes, Andrew. And maybe if I could just add on top of that. Andrew, our Andrew here explained it well. But as we think about the model impact and the financial impact of that. I mean, I think the first thing to always keep in mind is that live services still encompasses on a trailing 12-month basis, over 70% of our business. And that has been a proven very reliable, highly reoccurring revenue stream, and that will still be the predominant driver in our P&L long term.  Second, we've talked a lot about the areas of investment that we're making, and that's both in the live service as well as some of the single title launches that you've seen. And so over the course of time, we'll continue to invest in our long-term growth. We'll continue to invest in the ongoing stable performance of our live services business, and there'll be some puts and takes along the way. Q \u2013 Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Your line is open. Omar Dessouky : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. You mentioned that Apex Legends Mobile was successful versus your expectations. And I wanted to double-click on that. By what measures would you consider Apex Legends Mobile launch successful? And is bookings one of those measures? And then have you launched Apex Legends Mobile in all the geographies that you've intended? And how should we think about the second half advertising intensity of Apex Legends Mobile compared to what we've seen so far, especially in light of your comments on a weaker mobile environment in the second half. And then I have a follow-up. Laura Miele : Hi, Mark. Well, first, yes, we are pleased with the launch of the game that met our expectations for the quarter. And what we saw with Apex Legends on console, as we all know, is it was a massive uptake in the beginning and then followed by stabilization and really steady growth over the life cycle of the game, and we expect the same of this title on mobile. And in fact, this is the pattern seen by many mobile shooters. There are many years of revenue and return generation to be had, particularly when you look at the shooter category and we expect the same thing to be true for Apex mobile. And keep in mind, we are currently in week eight. So many years ahead, and we are in week eight, just getting started. One thing we know is we're very good at listening to our community, and we know how to respond to the needs of players and then the game dynamics that are required to respond. And keep in mind as well, we have an incredible team on this. We have Respawn, who is just best-in-class in the business for shooters. We have a meaningful mobile infrastructure now to execute globally with the additions of Glu and Playdemic and our mobile organization. And we also have an exceptional partnership with Tencent. So we are -- we've met our expectations. We're encouraged and we also know we have a significant runway ahead of us on this title. As it relates to advertising, we are again, looking at advertising as a dimension of our mobile business, though this is one that is primarily going to be focused on the internal game monetization. And that's how we're looking at the optimization of return on our investment in Apex. Omar Dessouky : Okay. I guess in the context of this weakening mobile macro environment for the second half, and kind of a stable expense guide. Does your stable expense guide assume more or less or the same investment in mobile user acquisition? Laura Miele : For Apex, we are -- it is -- we're holding it steady. So we are not changing our outlook on our investment or the return. So we're holding that for now. But again, as we -- the great thing about the mobile business is it's quite dynamic, and we're able to use multiple levers as it relates to game changes, evaluate engagement and evaluate the return that we're seeing. But at this time, we aren't changing our outlook on our investment or the revenue return that we get from that. Omar Dessouky : Okay. And just a quickie again on Apex Legends PC console this time. Does your guide for the full year include any kind of effect from competition of new shooters that may be launching this fall. Andrew Wilson : No. The way I would think about that, Omar, is that our guide takes into account what we view as the overall market conditions, Apex Legends had double-digit growth again in Q1. We're anticipating the full year to continue to grow on that very important franchise, and it does take into account both the things that we control from an execution standpoint as well as what we view as the market conditions, and that's all factored into the guidance that you heard. Omar Dessouky : Wonderful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking questions. Just a follow-up on Apex. With the mobile game coming out mid-quarter, did it have any impact, if any, on the console PC version in terms of bookings and users? In other words, the growth kind of pickup or slowdown post the mobile launch? Laura Miele : Hi, Mario, thanks for the question. It's so early to be candid. But what we are seeing is we are seeing tens of millions of new players coming into Apex, and we're seeing a significant impact in geographies and growth in geographies as far as penetration of the brand and the experience that are expanding the Apex brand in places that the high def and PC console didn't necessarily. So it's, again, more expansion into emerging markets. and a lot of new players coming into the brand that we're optimistic about. But it's early days for us to understand to see how things will play out. We have a new season coming on the high def and PC game in about a few weeks here. And so we will study and understand the impact that mobile has had on that. So more to come in our next earnings potentially on the context around the impact on the overall business. Mario Lu : Great. That's helpful. And just one on FIFA. You guys mentioned the whole franchise was strong during the quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove the strength in FIFA Online? And then, can you guys remind us, once the FIFA license rolls off, like what happens to these kind of persistent games like FIFA Online and FIFA mobile? Is it just a simple kind of rename or how is that going to work? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So I'll have Laura take the first part on just the performance in the quarter and then I'll talk a little bit more broadly about, how we think about the franchise going forward. Laura Miele : Yes. So on FIFA Online, 4 performance, the studio has studied and strongly focused for the last few years on efforts to improve the gameplay feel. And this has really started to pay off in player sentiment. So we continue to deepen our relationship with our players, and we have strong partners as we go to market in Asia and we're factoring the feedback into the game development. We're also seeing improved marketing and the growth of popularity of Global Football in Korea, which has had a big impact on the business. Andrew Wilson : And more broadly, as we said, we're going to launch the most expensive FIFA ever this year. I think it's extraordinary in demand is really strong. I was I was just in Europe, but I was bumping into young kids, and they'd find out I was doing that already preordered FIFA, which was extraordinary. I think we're seeing growth in the sport. Of course, we've got a World Cup here. And so our belief is that this is going to be a very strong year for our FIFA business. What -- the way that -- and without going broadly into the mechanics of our relationship with FIFA contracts or what have you, what you should expect is that we will launch the most expansive FIFA ever, we will then continue to sell that in the market and we have the ability to continue to do that. And then, we will begin launching the EA SPORTS FC brand more deliberately and more broadly in the market, beyond, again, what we did earlier this year, where we had nearly 200 of our 300 partners came out and promoted the EA SPORTS FC brand as a brand that we all collectively own, the 300 partners, Electronic Arts and our community of many hundreds of millions of players around the world. And so, while the name of the game will change the nature of the experience and the connection that players have to the game, to the leagues and teams they love and to the players they play with and play against in the community, that's many hundreds of men strong. None of that changes. We'll invest strongly into that and we're very excited about what that future will bring. And again, we announced our new LaLiga partnership which is going to expand on the nature of things we can do. And you remember, as we've talked about this through, we have been deeply grateful for our partnership with FIFA, which has existed for nearly 30 years, and we've built a tremendous business together. But we've been very excited in every conversation we've had about the types of things we're going to be able to do with our partners and for our community in the context of the blurring of the lines of football fandom between linear and interactive, what we do in the virtual world, and what we do in the real world, what we watch on television, what we experience in game and what we've announced with LaLiga is just the first step of that. And you should imagine that we'll continue to build and expand on this opportunity to truly bring together, what is the largest global football community around a brand that we all own together EA SPORTS FC. Mario Lu : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open. Eric Handler : Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. I am wondering, if you could talk about two franchises. First, with F1 showing growth on a year-over-year basis, this is your second year now with the title. Anything you're doing differently from a marketing perspective to -- or just a game perspective to drive the improved numbers there? And then secondly, with regards to the Sims, I think you just had your first expansion pack in about a year, maybe talk about what's been going on there? Laura Miele : Sorry. Thanks, Eric. There's a question I was muted there. We remain incredibly bullish and excited about the F1 business. And I would say that the development teams have integrated well into Electronic Arts. And I think that they're seeing some of the benefits of our scale globally. And certainly, when you look at our marketing and commercial divisions, I mean, we've had some of the developers actually comment and note the global footprint and reach and impact they've been able to have through our presence that we have with our marketing teams, commercial teams and commercial partnerships that they just haven't been able to benefit from before. So we're seeing strong development impact from the leadership we have here probably mostly in this year's release, and we are very optimistic about some of the dimensions of the game that we're going to bring to market in the years ahead. And then just the strength EA SPORTS brand and the really strong marketing and commercial teams that we have. And for the Sims question, you mentioned, so we -- one of my favorite things about the Sims business is how healthy and strong it is. We actually released game packs, content and expansion packs several a year. So we are persistently connected to our players in that community. And we are pretty excited about how strong and the size of this business after about 10 years. We've had the Sims 4 brand out. So this is something that we persistently put content into the player community, and we'll continue to do that for the years to come. Eric Handler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Mike Hickey : Hi, Andrew, Chris, Laura, Chris, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris Suh : Thanks Mike. Mike Hickey : Two questions. No problem. First question, sort of, broad ranging here, but really exciting news, at least for me. And I think the community on state and your decision, your team's decision to move from a premium plus live service release to what it looks like a pure free play live service. So just curious, qualitative or quantitative, the decision-making process to move from what was, I think, kind of highly anticipated premium launch to a pure free-to-play there's a quality level or a unit expectation that is part of the process there to move to pure free-to-play. And if this is maybe the beginning of seeing this in other genres, those lower tier sports games that three million to five million units, whether it's auto racing or MMA then maybe better live services in this market versus premium? I have a follow-up. Thanks guys. Andrew Wilson : Yeah, great question. I'll start, and then I'll hand over to Laura, who's been working deeply with the team. The first thing, as I was saying earlier, we really see growth in our future built on two key vectors; one, the ability to create worlds and characters and tell stories and that was to build really large global online communities. When we look at Skate, I think what's happened is our ambitions have continued to grow. As you've seen what the team has been able to do around that experience, I think we continue to see opportunity. Skateboarding is kind of a cultural language for many generations. It transcends so many things, certainly geography and as we think about the ability to bring a global community of youth together through the language of skateboarding. We think this represents one of the biggest and strongest opportunities we have to build a global online community, deeply engaged in a world that involves creativity both from us and from them experiencing what starts out as skateboarding and almost certainly reaches more deeply into the cultural sensibilities of a generation. So as we thought about that, we really took a step back and evaluated how best we deliver that. And Laura has been working with the teams on how they've thought through that puzzle. Laura Miele : So, one of the most important growth potential that we have as a company is how we show up for Gen Z and Gen Alpha players, how they socially connect, how they consume content. So there's been a significant focus from the team on this. And I'll talk about the team for a minute. We have some of the original creative leaders from the original Skate franchise. So, much of the DNA and goodness that people loved about skate exists in the team. And then, we also brought in someone Daniel McCulloch, who ran at the Xbox Live platform. So he deeply understands art and nuance of social connection, social engagement and how to nurture a community. And third, I think that Skate, back in the day Skate was a bit even ahead of its time. It was a lot of the core motivation around our Skate experience was around creative self-expression in social connection and competition. And we are bringing that to life in the biggest way we possibly can. So, more to come on this. We are in community testing now, we're very close to this skate community to get feedback, and we're pretty optimistic about how we're going to be coming to market soon. Mike Hickey : Nice. Thanks, Andrew, Laura. A second question, Andrew, a bit awkward here, but bear with me. The sort of subsequent your last call, there was a media article that came out sort of related to consolidation and sort of frame you as persistently pursuing a sale, which was, I think, kind of somewhat unsettling or at least puzzling to the investment community, our clients and you get a lot of questions on it. So, just curious, if you can sort of provide some framework around that or clarification or sort of your motivation to run a stand-alone company or otherwise? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : First, I'm sure you don't expect me to comment on rumors and speculation from some small red media outlets, but be that as it may. I would tell you, I think we are in an incredible position. We're soon to be the largest stand-alone independent developer and publisher of interactive entertainment in the world. I think we have the most incredible teams in our industry and the plan, as Laura spoke to earlier. We're attracting more and more incredible creative talent. We have a community that's $600 million strong that is growing and certainly, we're well on our way to aspirations of being able to engage a billion people in play across the planet. I think we're growing across platforms. We're growing across business models, and we're growing across geographies. And in a world where gaming is becoming more important to the lives of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who will be the leading generation in terms of consumption, entertainment for the future, I don't think we could be in a stronger position as a stand-alone company. Our objective always and my objective as CEO of this company is always to take care of our people, our players, and our shareholders. And should there ever be a way for us to do that differently the way we're doing it today, I, of course, have to be open to that. But I would tell you today, we feel very, very confident and excited for our future. Mike Hickey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Creutz : Hey thanks. Since the last conference call, you guys announced Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. Your fiscal Q4 big IP title is still unspecified in your current guidance. I'm just wondering if -- since you've announced Star Wars, do we assume that, therefore, that isn't the Star Wars game or should we not assume anything? Andrew Wilson : I think the advice would be do not assume anything. We will name the titles and fill in the blanks at the appropriate time. Doug Creutz : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Thanks Doug. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

It's great to be here with you all. We delivered solid performance across our business in Q2, driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. our broad IP, exceptional talent and growing player network of more than $600 million are the foundation of strength and stability in an uneven macro environment. During Q2, we launched Premier Sports Games and provided over 120 content updates on 35 titles across our global catalog. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering amazing games and entertainment that inspire fans to play create, watch and forge enduring social connections. Our broad IP portfolio is unrivaled in the gaming industry. Foundational to our leadership is EA Sports with breadth and depth of partnerships that allow us to continue delivering deeply immersive experiences to fuel long-term growth. Our Global Football business demonstrates the power of a multi-platform ecosystem with a massive community engaging through multiple experiences. In Q2, we delivered our biggest EA Sports FIFA console and PC launch in history. In addition, in FIFA Mobile, daily, weekly and monthly active players were up more than 100% year-over-year. And our free-to-play FIFA Online service in Asia delivered record performance. Now the entire global football community across our ecosystem will benefit from the unique holiday timing of the World Cup. Next week, we'll launch new World Cup content into FIFA 23, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online designed to attract, engage and entertain players throughout the tournament and beyond. For nearly 30 years, we've delivered the biggest and highest quality football games to fans all over the world. Across our ecosystem, we've built the world's largest football community with our players, 90,000 athletes, 700 teams, 30 leagues and federations, and more than 300 partners. As we now move into the future with EA Sports FC, we have even greater opportunity to engage the global audience of 3.5 billion football fans. Players will continue to experience everything they love about our games today. The modes, leagues, competitions, clubs, athlete, brands and more. We'll push the technical boundaries for even greater innovation, immersion and authenticity. And through more platforms and new modalities, we will reach new football fans all around the world, bringing them into our global community. This is what EA Sports FC is all about. In this unique year with our biggest ever console and PC title, a deeply engaging worldwide mobile experience, our online PC services in Asia and now with men's and women's World Cup content coming we are in an incredible position to unlock a truly extraordinary future with EA Sports FC. As the consumption of entertainment and sport converge and grow, EA Sports offers fans immersive experiences like no other, an ability to play, create, watch and connect with friends and the sports they love, 365 days a year. Now more than ever, Madden NFL is deeply ingrained into the fabric of NFL fandom, reaching broader entertainment audiences. With the sport of F1 continuing its growth trajectory, especially in the U.S., we are well positioned to expand the total addressable market for our F1 franchise. We have more than 200 million players engaged in our EA Sports games. As we look to the future of FC, Madden NFL, F1, NHL, UFC, PGA Tour and Mall, we will continue growing these ecosystems to reach new fans, expand in new experiences and create more social connectivity to fuel the enjoyment of sport. Our owned IP franchises continue to be among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is driving massive growth in emerging markets, and the team continues to build its content, universe, characters and storylines across multiple platforms and experiences. As we expand our console, PC and mobile experiences, Apex has captured the imagination of our global community beyond play. Not only are they playing, watching and competing, they're captivated by the law, the world's and storylines in and outside the game. We are just getting started and believe Apex will be one of the most important IPs in the world. Engagement in our Sims franchise continues to grow with millions of players unleashing their imaginations full of creativity, humor and individuality, both in-game and across the entire ecosystem. We expect engagement to grow with the Sims 4 base game recently becoming free to enter. Looking ahead, our team is working on a new creative platform for our Sims community giving them more collaborative ways to play, create, connect and share stories with their friends. In Q2, we also announced an exciting long-term multi-game collaboration with Marvel joining forces with a cultural defining powerhouse to expand our entertainment offerings. From our EA Sports League partners to Disney's Star Wars and Marvel Universes and more, we're partnering to grow our global communities, build value together and co-create the future of entertainment. Our player network of more than 600 million worldwide continues to grow. The unique value of this network is our ability to create new communities and meaningful connections that matter. In fact, more than 3/4 of EA players engage with gaming content beyond the game itself, reading, watching and creating content and engaging in social conversations through shared fandom. With EA Sports FC, Apex, the Sims, Skate and more, all poised to fuel fun and social connection, our growing network will continue adding long-term value. As we look ahead, our talent teams are focused on building extraordinary experiences that drive deep engagement to grow our communities and reach new audiences, particularly Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who are turning to games as their preferred choice for entertainment and social connection. Games continue to be one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment and the social networks of the future. We're in the privileged position of creating what people love doing more than anything else with their friends and family. Through our broad IP, our creative talent and our growing network of players, we are well positioned to lead the future of entertainment and deliver long-term value. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Suh : Thanks, and hello to everyone. As Andrew said, we had another solid quarter. Driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. And importantly, engagement from our players around the globe across both platforms and our broad portfolio of games continued to be strong fueling our resilient live services business and enabling us to deliver on our commitments even as we navigate through an uneven environment. Net bookings for the second quarter were $1.75 billion and in line with our expectations, down 5% or 2% in constant currency due to the timing of the F1 launch with the strength in console and PC offsetting mobile. Our live services net bookings were also in line with our expectations, down 3% year-on-year or flat in constant currency due to the timing of the FIFA launch offset by strength elsewhere in the business. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 66% of units sold through, up 5 percentage points from last year. Our EA Sports portfolio was the highlight and driver of Q2 net bookings. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise in the quarter, further demonstrating the power of our multi-platform ecosystem. FIFA net bookings grew 6% in constant currency, and we saw engagement increase significantly across all platforms. As Andrew mentioned, we delivered a record launch on FIFA 23. In the first 4 weeks, FIFA 23 sell-through unit sales were up 10% versus the comparable period for FIFA 22 and FUT players are up 6%. With the launch of Madden 23, Madden Ultimate Team players and net bookings are both up double digits year-on-year. We delivered Q2 net revenue of $1.9 billion, in line with our expectations and with a higher mix of console and PC-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were well above our expectations. Operating expenses were up 2% on last year, in line with our expectations as we continue to take a disciplined approach to investing in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $112 million, and we returned $378 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow is up 26% year-on-year. Now turning to guidance. We are providing an updated guidance range today, primarily due to the persistent FX rate environment. Just over half of our sales are generated outside of the U.S., and the U.S. dollar strengthened between 7% and 15% versus our largest foreign currencies when compared to rates at the time of our initial FY '23 guidance. As a result, we now expect an FX impact of approximately $200 million versus our initial full year net bookings guide as the impact will grow in our second half and into FY '24 at current exchange rates. Beyond FX, our business fundamentals remain healthy with strong player engagement trends across our platforms and franchises. We expect strength from our console and PC game franchises to offset most of the impact of the current mobile market softness. In particular, we expect to see the momentum of the FIFA 23 launch carry into the second half, aided by excitement surrounding the World Cup. With these factors considered, we are revising our full year net bookings guidance to $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion, up 2% to 4% year-on-year or 6% to 9% in constant currency. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.55 billion to $7.75 billion and expect cost of revenue to be $1.845 billion to $1.89 billion, below our prior range, reflecting the gross margin benefit from the revenue mix shift due to the relative strength of our console and PC franchises. We continue to be disciplined in our spend while also carefully prioritizing investments to fuel our long-term growth, and we expect operating expenses to be $4.245 billion to $4.295 billion. Accordingly, our updated GAAP earnings per share guidance is now higher at $3.11 to $3.34. Importantly, our expectations for underlying profitability for the year remain unchanged, even after accounting for the FX headwinds. We are also reaffirming our guidance for operating cash flow at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, with capital expenditures of about $200 million that results in free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter. We expect Q3 '23 net bookings to be $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion, driven by our annualized franchises plus the launch of Need for Speed Unbound on December 2. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue to be $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $560 million to $580 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.59 for the third quarter. To summarize, our solid second quarter results again demonstrate the power of the EA model. We carry momentum into the second half. FIFA is off and running with the World Cup set to accelerate engagement. Need for Speed Unbound is ready for launch and a strong slate is queued up for Q4. We've extended the Apex franchise to mobile, enabling us to reach more people in more geographies than ever before and expect it to continue to grow over time. And with the Sims 4 now free to enter, we look forward to welcoming more players than ever into this beloved franchise. With our strong pipeline, healthy engagement trends, durable and highly recurring live services model and a continued focus on discipline and execution, we are well positioned for the future. Now I'll hand it back over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. In Q2, EA delivered strong engagement and deeply immersive experiences across our portfolio with new EA Sports titles and multi-platform live services powering the business. We have a deep slate of new titles set for the second half of the year. Entertainment is a fundamental human need. And in this dynamic environment, we are focusing on our strengths, providing amazing games and live services that inspire the world to play. With our incredible talent, our growing play network and more people than ever engaging and connecting through games, we are excited to lead and create the future of entertainment. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matthew Cost from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Cost : I have two here. So in an environment where, Andrew, you mentioned, obviously, things are changing, consumers are under pressure. Are you observing any changes in the behavior of users. For example, are people perhaps prioritizing buying a copy of FIFA and maybe spending less on the Ultimate Team or is there anything that you've noticed that's starting to shift in the behavior of your users? And then secondly, on the pipeline, I think the fourth quarter is still showing a major title that doesn't have a specific name to it yet. Should we interpret that as there's a title that's tentatively slated for the fourth quarter, but it could potentially be pushed out? Just any color you can add there? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great questions. First one on user behavior. I think the one thing to reinforce is we are seeing extraordinary engagement across our business, particularly in our key titles like FIFA and like Apex and like The Sims. And remember, this extraordinary engagement of what was already extraordinary engagement coming through COVID and many had believed that we were going to see meaningful changes, a meaningful drop-off to our engagement post-COVID as the world kind of went mostly back to normal. And we haven't seen that yet. We've continued to see really strong engagement across our products. And certainly, with the launch of FIFA and Madden, both of which are up and the ongoing strength in Apex and The Sims, we feel really good about the future. What we do want to say, though, is that we're going to be very deliberate as we move through the back half of the year. We've got an extraordinary slate through the back half. We feel very good about that slate. But it's hard to ignore all of the narrative around us and some of the commentary around what might be challenging economic times particularly in Europe that seems to be dealing with that more dramatically so far than the U.S. As it stands right now, we haven't seen meaningful shifts in behavior. We expect that we will grow but we also want to be very thoughtful, focused and deliberate as we move through this environment because if it gets really bad, I don't think anybody is immune, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're unbelievably resilient and why we're focused on building incredible games and driving deep engagement with our community, which so far is working really, really well for us. On the second point around the title, you shouldn't read anything into that other than the nature of marketing in our industry has meaningfully changed over the past 5 or 6 years. You might remember when we launched Apex Legends, we didn't tell anybody about it until about 48 hours before the community get to play it. And as we continue to see the shift, the big shift, of course, in the recent decade was a move from television to digital. We've moved into more targeted digital and now we're moving in a more targeted timing around digital. And so for each franchise, our development teams and marketing teams come together and think through what is the most appropriate time to begin meaningfully communicating with our community around what titles are coming. And so we feel really good about our slate. We feel really good about that particular title as it turns out. Actually really, really good. But it just -- our teams right now are still working through the appropriate timing for launching and marketing, communicating around that title. Operator : Our next question comes from Benjamin Soff from Deutsche Bank. Benjamin Soff : Thanks for the question. So pretty exciting stuff with the Marvel partnership. I was wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit more about what that might mean for the long-term growth for your business? And the press release referenced at least 3 games, I believe. So what do you think some of the things are that your partner might be looking for as they evaluate whether or not to extend this partnership to additional games? Laura Miele : Thanks, Benjamin. Great question. When we think about our growth potential in our portfolio, we certainly consider the games that we create, the world, the characters. We also look at the expansion of our player community and the diversity of players that we can bring in. When you think about the breadth of our portfolio from real-world sports to our original IP, including Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Skate, Need for Speed. We also have licensed IP. You think about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and of course, now Marvel, as you mentioned. So we consider this licensed IP, an incredibly important component of expanding, diversifying and casting our net wider to bring new players in. And when we looked at our Star Wars business, as an example, we brought millions of players into our community and what we realized and have seen is that over 40% of those players have gone on to play other games in our portfolio. So we consider adding licensed IP as a pretty significant engagement model to our overall community as we grow. And we're just thrilled to welcome the Marvel partners into our creative teams, and we're incredibly confident that we're going to build meaningful content for our fans. We have generally approached these types of creative partnerships kind of away from the contract. We don't want it to be a transactional partner to really embrace a creative partnership and co-create together. And we've seen great success in our past, and we expect no difference for the future with Marvel. Operator : Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky from Bank of America. Omar Dessouky : I'd like to ask about your 4 objectives of play, create, watch and social and how they're going to affect your business long term? And then I have a follow-up. So the first question is, are these initiatives you need to undertake in order to keep pace with the growth in the video game industry or exceed growth in the video game industry? And as you build out these features around your core franchises, sort of 5 years out, by what factor could they help your core franchises grow? And then I have a follow-up. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. So as we think about the 4 key vectors of opportunity for us, play, create, watch and connect. The first thing to -- as we look at existing network of plays over 600 million. As we look at new onboarding plays in the kind of Gen Z and Gen Alpha populations, what we discover is the first thing that they are expecting from us is that we expand play. So when I started building games this industry over 20 years ago, we were primarily playing single-player games or on-the-couch games. We then moved from single player to multiplayer, off-line to online, one-on-one to one versus many. We've seen these ongoing inflection points that have expanded the nature of play. I think as we are looking now and as you look at what we're doing in and around our games like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims, like Apex and many others, is we are expanding the modalities of play beyond what might have been a traditional mechanic within in a game. And as we continue to drive these franchises forward, we start asking ourselves what happens in FC when you're not playing on the pitch? What happens in The Sims when you leave your home and go to someone else's home? What happens in Apex when you move beyond the existing map or the existing modality of play? And so every time we offer an expanded play option, what we do see is it attracts more people and it drives deeper engagement in the franchise. Also, as we look at these generations of course, you don't have to look very far to see that created such a big and important part of all entertainment, particularly games. And as you look at YouTube and TikTok and Snap and others over the past 5 or 10 years, we've seen this become an even more important part of entertainment and social connection amongst these audiences. And as we think now about -- even if we go back as far as creating things in The Sims and only in Battlefield moment and sharing highlights from FIFA, and now the ability for players to come in and move things around in the world as a first step, create new things and put them into the world as a second step and really create new aspects of these worlds as a third step what we see again is that more than half of our community engages in player-created content. And so it attracts and it onboards new players. I watch my 7-year-old son get introduced to new games because he's watching created content on YouTube for the games that we make. And quite frankly, some of the games that our competitors make. And so this notion of creativity and the ability to engage the community to create is a really important part of our future both in the expansion of our worlds to fuel the insatiable appetite for content that our global community of players has but also to deepen engagement. Again, and as part of that, watch is becoming a really important part. We get 2 billion or 3 billion hours of play in FIFA a year, and we get nearly as much of that watching FIFA game play. The same is true for Apex. We're seeing this grow more and more across our ecosystem. And then finally, we're seeing connections that are formed amongst 4 and 5 and 6 people. These atomic units as part of these global communities that are the most meaningful connections. These players are spending 90 minutes, 2 hours a day together, playing the games together and then sharing that content beyond the traditional boundaries of games. And so as we think about our opportunities across these 4 vectors, we really think about it, which of these things are going to allow us to attract more people, we think it's very reasonable to believe that we can entertain 1 billion people in play. And we think about these things in the context of driving deeper engagement in the overall ecosystem, being it's very reasonable to believe that we can get that 1 billion people to engage with us for at least an hour a day. And what we know about our business is that people spend money where they spend their time and provided we offer incredible innovation, incredible creativity, incredible quality and incredible value that, that will ultimately present extraordinary opportunities for financial growth for us in the future. Omar Dessouky : Okay. A wonderful answer. So it sounds like you're really at the forefront of innovation rather than this just being table stakes for the video game industry of the future. My second -- correct me if I'm wrong. My second question is, in the past, like in 2017, you've said that you spend about 25% of your R&D budget on new IP. Things that may never see the light of day. So based on fiscal '22, that would be around $400 million to $500 million. First of all, is that kind of still the case? And second of all, as you build out the tool sets necessary to achieve play, create, watch and social, should we think about incremental R&D spend on top of that? Or will the kind of additional expenses to create out those tool sets and initiatives be part of that 25% or even the existing budgets within existing franchises? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. The first thing to acknowledge is, and I've talked about 20%, 25% in the past. One, it's not a static number. It changes over time based on what's going on in our various incubation and development and production pipelines. As we think about investing, the primary investment for us is always going to be building incredible games. And for us, that really falls in 2 key categories : building out these global online gaming communities around our biggest IP : FC, Battlefield, Apex, The Sims, Madden, Skate is coming down the pipe. And so that's 1 category investment for us. And a lot of that 20%, 25% goes into new modalities of play and you create in and around those ecosystems that are very proven, very stable and represent extraordinary opportunities for growth. The second area is around building these worlds and creating these characters and tell these amazing stories both in our owned IP and in the IP of our partners as we co-create the future of entertainment. And we really think about interactive storytelling as the future form of storytelling that most consumers will choose as their first form of entertainment. And a chunk of that 20%, 25% goes into those things, things that we do with our partners at Disney across Star Wars and Marvel will fall into that category. The third category, which is a much smaller category, but probably represents one of the biggest long-term upside opportunities is how do we think about deriving value from the power of our network beyond the bounds of nutritional game experience. We've got 600 million, we're going to go to 1 billion. I hope that we get to 2 billion people in our network and they spend 1.5 hours a day in our games, and then they spend another 90 minutes a day doing things outside of our games, but that are deeply connected to the games that they play. And what is our opportunity there? And one such opportunity might be, how do we disrupt the consumption of sport. How do we really think about sport from an interactive viewpoint. If you star in one of our games, but you are a deep sports fan, what other things might be able to do with you with our partners that would fuel your sports fandom. And while that's a relatively small investment for us today, it does represent a pretty significant upside to the expansion of what we're able to do with our global network of players and fans around the world over the course of the next 3 to 5 years. As we think about investment more broadly, you shouldn't imagine that this is deep incremental investment. This is about really focusing our existing investment in the right areas. And part of what we have to do as a company always is be very deliberate, very disciplined and very focused on how we invest. And because we're in the entertainment business, we have to acknowledge that not everything we do will work or at least work exactly as we planned. And we have to be very ready to move and shift and reshape our organization and the investment that we put into it to drive that future. So you shouldn't expect some giant new incremental spend, but you should expect us to continue to move investment around our company and where we feel like there are really big upside opportunities in the area of global online communities, in the area of interactive storytelling, in the area of hiring the power of our network beyond the bounds of a traditional gaming experience and where we believe that we have very strong likelihood of success and growth, we will invest behind those things. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : I hope everyone on the team as well. Maybe just on the mobile front, we've obviously gotten a lot of questions from investors has been sort of the last 12 to 15 months of headwinds that have been created by Apple's privacy changes. But obviously, there's a long tailed opportunity to get mobile right, especially AAA games on mobile over the medium to long term, and there's been a lot of capital allocated towards M&A in mobile. How are you thinking about investing behind mobile? Mobile continuing to grow as a percentage of the mix and how to navigate some of the maybe challenges in terms of growing the user base and monetizing in game that mobile continues to face in this environment? Laura Miele : Thanks, Eric. Great question. We see mobile remaining one of the largest platforms in the games business, and it represents a pretty significant growth path for us, particularly with our large franchises. So there's a couple of parts have how to think about this. And we are looking at mobile as an expansion in multiplier on our big franchises such as FIFA, Apex. As an example, when we look at our FIFA mobile business, 75% of our FIFA mobile players exist outside of Europe and North America. So that's significant reach and global impact for our FIFA mobile game. So we continue to believe that the mobile business will be -- will contribute to these big online communities that Andrew has talked about and has discussed in our vision and strategy and be a multiplier for these gaming ecosystems for players. And when we think about a post-ATT world or post-IDFA world, what's most meaningful is having these large communities and well-known brands for strong reach. And so we are confident in our position to have an impact beyond some of the challenges that some are experiencing in a post-ATT world. As we think about our acquisitions and our stand-alone business, we continue to see strength in games such as Galaxy, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And when we look at Glu, our Glu acquisition, that is some of those properties such as Design Home, Cabot fashion, we believe are going to be strong contributors to our lifestyle Sims sort of business. Then we also have the Tap Sports business that clearly we have big strength in sports. And so we continue to believe that those will contribute to our strategic growth path as we head into the future. So yes, there have been headwinds in the mobile market, and we continue to believe that mobile as a platform will provide the global player reach for our big franchises. And we believe with our big community, it will continue to help us with some of our stand-alone mobile games with our large communities and big brands. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario Lu : The first one is on FIFA. Just wondering if you could help double quick on the main factors that attributed to the 10% unit growth year-on-year? Is it the new features such as cross-play? Is it the upcoming World Cup content? Anything you can add from today would be helpful. Andrew Wilson : Yes, I think that the first one around our business there is we live in a symbiotic relationship with a real world of football. And the real world of football continues to grow. This is the world's game. It's the greatest game on the planet. There might be some that would argue with me on that front. But certainly, as you travel around the world, there are more fans of this sport than pretty much any other sport on the planet, and it continues to grow and the engagement by virtue of technology advancements around access to content continues to fuel growth in the sport itself. As you then think about what our teams do in the context of innovation and creativity in modes, and this is our biggest FIFA yet and we're delivering across all of the key leagues and teams and competitions in the world, and we're doing it at incredibly high quality, and we're really working closely with our fan base to understand how they want to experience interactive football through our game around the content that they love the most. And so as we look through -- over the last nearly 30 years, this is what this team has continued to do year in, year out. It has continued to grow year-over-year, and it really is the double multiplier of the growth of the sport itself combined with a team dedicated to innovation and creativity around that sport working in lockstep with a growing global community. And our expectation is that as we think forward to FC, that we're going to be able to do even more of this both in the context of immersion and authenticity of the very core of the sport as well as the expansion of what the overall experience can embody for football fans around the world. Mario Lu : Great. And then just a second one on mobile, specifically on Apex Mobile. Just curious how it's progressing versus your internal expectations? And are there any early learnings that could be applied to other franchises like Battlefield that will ultimately be brought to mobile as well? Laura Miele : Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the mobile response earlier, mobile continues to contribute to the overall growth of some of our biggest franchises and brands. And that is certainly the case with Apex Mobile for the overall Apex brand. We're seeing player and geographic expansion in Southeast Asia, Middle East, Latin America. That is exactly how we had hoped for and what we were expecting. Now we are 24 weeks into our launch. And while we've delivered a strong experience, the rating on the App Store is quite strong, and we're proud of the quality of the game. And our core players have connected with it quite well. We are now focused on improving our retention for our more casual players, and that is definitely an area of focus for us and an area of improvement. And this is very much a natural part of the cycle and process as we bring these games to market. And we believe and we know that Apex Mobile will continue to help us drive the growth for the overall Apex mobile brand and franchise in the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies. Andrew Uerkwitz : Let me ask a couple of questions. I guess Andrew, and maybe Laura can chime in here. When you talk about kind of the 4 big initiatives around social and whatnot, it seems like The Sims and maybe skate it solidly in kind of all 4 of those categories. Could you talk a little bit about how that kind of game design process goes as you try to figure out how to incorporate user-generated content and maybe a marketplace and maybe some sort of social fabric that overlays those types of games versus maybe what expectations are going to be from gamers who might think they just want to play a Skate game or just want to play kind of a housebuilding game? Andrew Wilson : Yes. I mean it's a longer and more complicated question than I probably have time for today, but I would tell you the way we think about it is really around player motivations. And when we design for a game, we're really thinking about what motivations are we trying to fulfill. And you've got 1 group that -- and I kind of go with a crude kind of cohort grouping you got 1 group who simply want to fuel the motivation of escape. They want to be able to disappear from the world they live in day-to-day and immerse themselves in a new world, and that be the sum total of their experience. And that's a really important thing for them. And we have to think about that across the breadth of our portfolio. There might be another group who says, \"Hey, I want to be able to -- I want to play -- I want to immerse myself in this world, but I want to do it with a core group of friends. And I want to bring them in. We call this an atomic unit. We see this amongst players in groups of kind of 4 or 5. These are the strongest connections we see in our network. And really, the experience they have is around doing things in the context of this group environment with 4 or 5 people. There's another group who says, \"Hey, I want to do this thing. I might do it by myself or I might do it with other people, but I really want to very quickly be able to share everything I'm doing with the outside want to capture cool moves I do. I want to be able to capture cool things I build and we were to share that almost immediately with the outside world through social media and other platforms. And it's really kind of an ad hoc thing, and it's not very polished, but it's just like, look, what I'm doing, and it's think about it like a kid on the playground who just has a summer salt on the trend is no, watch me. And so we're fueling that motivation. And then we have a fourth group who really wants to create and curate and share their content in a highly polished format. And that we see in the context of The Sims. And we'll certainly see it in the context of Skate, and we're seeing that kind of start to rise up in things that people want out of our FC experience and our Madden experience and certainly has been and will continue to be part of our Battlefield experience over time. And so really, when we think about designing and building these things, we start with a player first, and we start with what are the motivations they're trying to fulfill. And then we look to build tools that seamlessly and without friction, fulfill those motivations for them in the best way possible. And what we are seeing is that we're able to fulfill motivations across that full spectrum of cohorts, and that's why our network is growing so rapidly. That's why our engagement is continuing to be strong, and that's why people are spending more time in our games and using this as a platform to build deep enduring connections with their friends. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then as I think about some of the kind of less -- some of the games that maybe have less of that when I think about the single player -- the single player stuff you're building. Is some of the motivation there at the end of the day, somewhat financial where -- my guess is the predictability of the success of whether it's the licensed IP or maybe some of the stuff out of a where you can -- where it's easier to kind of do the math on the ROI and it's just more predictable and you feel there's a need for those types of gains every single year? Andrew Wilson : Again, entertainment has been built on the creation of world, the development of character telling the story since time began, and we've experienced it in different forms over time, we had to go to the theater, then we would read about it, then we listened to it on the radio and then we watch it the movie, then we watch it in television. Now we experienced that through games. And it is how we entertain ourselves first and foremost, as we think about these great storytelling opportunities. And so again, as a publicly-traded company, we're always thinking about the financial return of the things that we do. But as we think about the full breadth of the consumption of sports and entertainment, these deep social experiences are very much about how we enjoy attainment, but the creation of world and development character and telling of stories is kind of the central life blood of entertainment more broadly. And as we think about this, it's not just about predictability because, again, there are being crappy worlds and crappy characters and story is being told. And so we work with our partners and we work with our own IP to do things in a truly compelling way, and we think it represents an extraordinary business opportunity as we don't believe humanity is going to turn it back on the nature of storytelling. As we look to the future, the nature of storytelling is almost certainly going to be interactive. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Eric Handler : Wonder if you could talk a little bit about your decision to give the Lord of the Rings mobile gain a bit more time in soft launch given the current mobile market conditions. Right now, in this post-IDFA world, is it just too challenging to find good ROI channels to launch a new game on a mass market level? What is it you're seeing there? And then secondly, can you maybe talk about your decision to take The Sims to free-to-play model? Laura Miele : Eric, so we put the Lord of the Rings mobile game in the market and soft launch a few months ago, and it's being developed by the same team that created one of our most successful mobile games and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And I would say it's actually a very normal part of our process to go out to soft launch and allow our community and player feedback to inform how we're thinking about game development. So we consider this to be a pretty normal natural part of our cycle and aren't seeing anything unnecessarily unusual. And the game and the game needs more time. We need more time to continue to flesh out our progression loops to simplify our -- for our first time user experiences. And we're confident that we will get to market soon with the game. And as you mentioned, having a big brand like Lord of the rings and a great creative partner, they're seeing good success in this franchise right now is going to help us in a post ATT world. So in partnership with our big online community that we have and a big Lord of the Rings brand and a healthy soft launch so we can get the game metrics and the game play right, we will come to market when the time is right for the game and for our players. Andrew Wilson : And on The Sims, again, it's nearly 10 years old now. I mean there are people who are going to want to play The Sims 4 -- yes it's nearly 10 years old now. When we think about -- there's a bunch of people who want to play that game who may not have even been born when we launch the game. And while we have a community of many tens of millions of people playing, we recognize the opportunity to really open up and bringing anyone who wants to experience The Sims 4. As we look to the last 12 months, about 90% of all revenue was from extra content, not the base game. And so as we think about the future, as we think about the evolution of The Sims experience and really bringing in more people to enjoy what The Sims offers the playing community. We felt that this was the right time. And I commend the team for really making this happen and really supporting their community. And what we've seen on balance is the community has been very thankful for this, very supportive of this and is looking forward to welcoming what we hope is many millions more into that ecosystem overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. And I think this is a topic that we've explored before, but with what looks like the sequel for Sims under development, I thought I'd bring this up again. And I think this, for lack of a better word, I guess, the lower and the body of work that exists in Sims 4 because, as you say, the game is like 10 years old now, and there's a lot of content that you've released over the years. And should we be thinking about how Sims 5 when it's released, may feel a little bit empty. And I think this is something that we worried about in the -- for Battlefield in the past. So what can we do as we think about sequels and follow-ups generally? Does this mean that things need to spend more time and development for that additional content? How should we think about that? Andrew Wilson : Yes, it's a really good question, and I appreciate you using Sims as an example, but I think the question is probably broader than just The Sims. And I would say that there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Certainly, as we think about some of our iterative titles that we do each and every year, our objective is to build enough content and enough innovation and enough creativity that delivers extraordinary value for the amount that our community invest in each of those titles. And we have been very successful in doing that, and we commit many hundreds of people on those franchises to ensure that we deliver all of those things, particularly value to our community, to fulfill the expectations they have for what a new title would bring. We have other things like the titles that come out of BioWare that really is about giving them time to build out these worlds and create these characters and tell these stories in a new innovative and creative way. Without using The Sims as an example, but using things like Skate as a potential example and maybe others in our franchise, there's also an opportunity, in some cases, to have an existing experience continue while layering in a new modality of that experience on top. And certainly, what we're going to see with Skate is you're going to be able to get in there and you're going to be able to skate and do all the things that we've been able to do in Skate games in the past. But there's a whole new modality around creation and social connection, that's going to be a meaningful part of that game going forward. And so to answer your question, I think that we're looking at every franchise in its own stead, and we're asking ourselves, what is the right thing to do with respect to this franchise. Some for our iterative franchise is about getting just the right amount of people into a team to deliver innovation and creativity, for some like our BioWare franchise is about giving time to really build out these worlds characters and story lines. And for other franchises like Skate, and certainly, as we think about the future of Sims, it's how do we hold on to all of the goodness of the existing franchise and layer in new modalities and extensions of how you play these games for a growing and changing and evolving diverse community around the world. Operator : This question comes from Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company. Douglas Creutz : I was wondering if you could talk about Wild Hard a little bit. I think, normally, when you guys have partner titles, they tend to be lower-priced in de titles. But this -- I think, correct me if I'm wrong, is coming to market at a $70 price point. So -- should we think of the opportunity set here the way that we would think about it for a AAA title sort of in general? And is this a game you think has franchise potential down the line? Andrew Wilson : Yes. So first thing I would say just to differentiate there. I think what we have had is EA Originals, which were lower-priced titles. This was an initiative that we developed some years ago really to support the India community and the industry growth opportunity overall. What we were seeing in the industry was these India developers were kind of building these very cool games. They didn't have the means to get into market in a big way and they didn't have the ability to continue on because the business model wasn't working for them at least for their first title. And what we did at that time was go into the community and say, \"All right, let's handpick some really great teams who are building some really cool games around really cool IP. Let's help -- let's fund development for them. Let's get them distribution and let's give them the profits on the back end so that they can come together and build an even bigger game a second time around. Most of those have been smaller, lower-priced titles. However, in the history and -- I mean the company 22 years, we have a long and rich history of co-developing, co-publishing and distributing AAA full-priced IP, all the way back for as long as I can remember. We don't do as much of it anymore just because there's not as much of it out there that we think really fits the bill and is it a AAA quality bar that we believe can deliver against the expectations of these global communities at a full price point. We think Wild Heart is one. I mean I would tell you, it started with what felt like a pretty small idea for us internally. And every time we saw the product, we were wowed and mesmerized by what they were doing. The Monster Hunter genre is a relatively new genre. It exploded. It is ripe for innovation and creativity and expansion and what we see the team doing is all of the things that the community is asking for in the genre. And so -- and the response so far has been really, really strong. And so I don't want to get out over my skis on this one. But I would tell you, I saw it. I think it's incredible. The community has seen it, they think it's incredible. How big it can be. We don't quite know yet, but I think there's a path for this to be a really, really cool opportunity for us, for the development team and for the community at large. Operator : Our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : I have a couple of follow-up questions. I guess first, Andrew, I just wanted to talk about the approach to World Cup this year, how that differs from the prior cup given some of the challenges last time around on the core franchise. And then on live services, if you wouldn't mind providing a little more color on engagement and monetization trends for Apex, just given this has been such a big part of the portfolio growth over the past few years. Are you satisfied with the trends there? And how do you expect those KPIs to trend with the launch of new content this quarter? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Let me grab the first part around World Cup, and then I'll let Chris speak to kind of engagement trends and those types of things around Apex. First, I might challenge the idea that we had troubles with the World Cup last time. But I might be base front. Again, I think we brought in and brought back about 12 million players back into the franchise with World Cup content. It was one of our highest engagement opportunities of that year. I think there may have been externally some expectations on higher revenue at that time. What you might remember we talked about was we believed it was a really strong engagement opportunity. We use it to bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise and we projected and predicted that it would drive growth in the out years beyond the World Cup. And of course, that has happened each and every year since that World Cup. So we feel really, really bullish on what this World Cup can do for us. What I would say without going into broad details, it is more deeply integrated into the mode. It was more kind of an add-on adjunct to the product. Last time it was very cool. It was great content. It was World Cup. What we -- what the team has done this time is we take that content and embed it more deeply into the overall experience of the game. And our expectation is that while it will bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise, it will also drive even deeper engagement over time. And we think that is good for the long-term prospects of the product, particularly as we launch FC next year to build and grow that community to its absolute greatest possible point at this juncture is a great opportunity for us. Christopher Suh : Great. And I'll jump in, Colin, and talk a little bit about our engagement. As we've talked about on this call, we're seeing -- we're in this enviable position of seeing healthy engagement trends across the breadth of our business. We talked a lot about FIFA. But Apex is another one where we're very pleased with the state of player engagement with Apex. We've grown that business, as you know, in a very short period of time into a substantial business. As Andrew talked about, it's one of the great IPs and entertainment. We're seeing very stable engagement. We continue to grow the franchise. We feel great about upcoming releases of new innovation into the game. It continues to be an important franchise for us, and we'll continue to invest behind it as well as feed growth now and into the future. Andrew Wilson : But today, I was going to say the same thing. Thank you to all for being with us today. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

During Q3, EA entertained hundreds of millions of fans through our games and multi-platform live services. Our teams delivered high quality experiences reaching global communities, providing 128 content updates across 36 titles. We launched two new AAA releases : NHL 23 in October, and Need for Speed Unbound in December, both earning strong reception and positive reviews. The just-released Dead Space has also earned high praise from fans and critics alike, being dubbed \u201ca new benchmark for remakes\u201d and even \u201cone of the best games of all time.\u201d We drove record engagement during the quarter on some of our biggest franchises, even surpassing historical highs delivered over the last several years. Our player network also continues to grow, now over 650 million. While we delivered for our players and engagement was strong in the quarter, the macro environment remained challenging and impacted Q3 results.  During the quarter we took measured action to reduce our expenses, and we continue to exercise cost discipline, further focusing our investments in key areas of growth. As we navigate the short-term, we remain focused on what fuels our business : delivering high quality entertainment and driving strong engagement across our global network. The passion and enthusiasm for interactive entertainment continues to grow. For more and more people around the world, games are a cherished and authentic way to stay connected with the people they care about, build community, and find joy through shared experiences. Across all of entertainment, people are diving deeper and engaging further with their favorite franchises. EA SPORTS FIFA is at the heart of global football culture, and once again we delivered strong engagement in Q3 across our entire ecosystem.  Year-to-date net bookings from our FIFA franchise has grown 4% or 15% at constant currency. FIFA 23 is pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history, delivering record engagement in Q3. In North America alone unit sales are up over 50% year-over-year. FIFA Mobile engagement was up triple digits in Q3, and FIFA Online in Asia is hitting the highest monthly active users in years. This engagement fueled strong financial performance. We have incredible momentum in our global football ecosystem. For 30 years we\u2019ve been leaders in interactive football and collaborated with the most extensive network of partners spanning the globe. Our games are interwoven with the fabric of football fandom, averaging 300 million hours of gameplay every month. We are unbelievably excited to take this energy into the future with our EA SPORTS FC brand, where we'll deliver even more for fans as part of an expanding experience with endless ways to play, watch, create and connect through their love of football. Madden NFL is the world\u2019s preeminent interactive American football experience and one of the most powerful franchises in sports. We continue to invest in innovation to drive engagement and growth across this mega-franchise. Madden NFL 23 had a solid holiday quarter driven by Ultimate Team, and Madden NFL Mobile launched a new season and multiple in-game events further powering engagement. With big moments ahead, like Super Bowl LVII and Team of The Year, Madden NFL will continue to entertain millions of fans. Our EA SPORTS & Racing teams are the best in the business. The convergence of sport and entertainment is picking up pace. Through our investments in technology and new experiences, we will continue to push the boundaries and blur the lines between the digital and physical by empowering players to come together, express their fandom, and build online communities, both in and around our games. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world, with mega-franchises like Apex Legends and The Sims. Apex Legends has historically had a quieter Q3 as the live service model ebbs and flows against a seasonally crowded launch slate this time of the year. Moving into Q4, we\u2019re already seeing a rise in engagement as we approach the game\u2019s four-year anniversary and the launch of a new season, bringing highly anticipated updates and fresh content. Apex is one of the few IPs in its genre with proven endurance to engage and re-engage players as they play, watch, and compete. The Sims is also evolving and growing as a live service. In Q3 we took the base game free to enter and welcomed over 10 million new players into the community, driving strong engagement. Our teams are gearing up to add more collaborative ways to further empower our community to unleash their imaginations. We have incredible opportunities ahead. To do more extraordinary things in service of our players and our people, we are making deliberate decisions and reallocating investments to prioritize our biggest growth areas, building global online communities around our biggest franchises, telling incredible interactive stories, and harnessing the power of our social ecosystem to create meaningful connections. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering incredible experiences for our players. As part of this commitment, we have made the player-first decision to move Star Wars Jedi : Survivor\u2019s launch date to April 28. The game is a creative and innovative leap forward, going further into the experience of a Jedi, delivering more content, more exploration, and more fun. Anticipation for the game is incredibly high and the Respawn team known around the world for delivering top quality entertainment is focusing on the final polish stage to enhance performance, stability, and most importantly, the player experience. Giving the team these extra few weeks to deliver the best experience for our players will not only result in a higher quality game, but puts us in a best position to grow the long-term value of the franchise. We\u2019re also making strategic decisions around two mobile titles. Apex Legends Mobile won game of the year on both iPhone and Android. Despite this strong start, the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players. After months of working with our development partner, we have made the mutual decision to sunset this version of the game. We\u2019ve learned a great deal and have plans to reimagine a connected Apex mobile experience in the future. It is through these learnings, combined with a clear franchise strategy, that we\u2019ve also made the decision to stop the development of the current Battlefield mobile title. We know our community values a deeply connected ecosystem and our team is focused on delivering the best, unified cross-platform experience for our players. Everything we do is designed to inspire the world to play. As a company, our teams have demonstrated that with a culture of creativity, innovation and resilience, we can grow through transformative periods of change and lead the future of entertainment. As we look ahead, our teams remain focused and disciplined as we reshape our investments toward a future of accelerated content generation, increased direct player engagement and deeply connected ecosystems to bring more people into our global community. We are taking strategic actions to evaluate our cost structure as we navigate through the current macro environment.  With our exceptional talent, our broad portfolio of amazing IP, and massive player network, we remain committed to delivering long-term value in our business. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris. Chris Suh : Thank you. As Andrew shared, we delivered strong engagement and high-quality titles again in Q3. Nevertheless, our results were mixed relative to our expectations. Based on Q2 trends and leading indicators, we had built our Q3 guidance on four key underlying assumptions : First, that our player network would continue to expand, and engagement metrics remain healthy. Second, we would see strong momentum for FIFA, our global football franchise. Third, that we would release high-quality new games into the market; and finally, that Apex would experience its typical seasonal low in Q3. While these assumptions were directionally correct, net bookings came in short of our expectations. We achieved new highs in our player network, sustained healthy engagement trends, and delivered a record quarter for the entire EA SPORTS FIFA franchise. However, the performance of new games, despite strong reviews, and of the Apex franchise, was below the levels we had anticipated, reflecting the challenging market dynamics.  Recognizing the softer net bookings trend, we proactively took focused measures during the quarter to reduce our costs and lessen the impact on our underlying profitability. Now let\u2019s go through the quarter in more detail. Net bookings for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, down 9% or 5% in constant currency, driven largely by a tough comp as we lap the launch of Battlefield 2042 and by Apex performance, partially offset by strength across the entire FIFA ecosystem and the launch of \u2018Need for Speed Unbound.\u2019 Madden 23 was level with a very strong quarter last year. Our life services net bookings were down 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Growth at constant currency was driven by strength in FIFA, with rapid growth occurring in FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 75% of our business. We delivered Q3 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year.  Operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend as we lap the Battlefield 2042 launch. Further, we reduced costs by just over $60 million by moderating our hiring and prioritizing our variable spend in the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion and we returned $377 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, moving to guidance. As we navigate an uncertain market, I\u2019d like to share more context about how we set our Q4 guidance. First and most important, we expect we will continue to execute well on the two most important drivers of our long-term success and growth : strong player engagement and the production of high-quality games, like the just-released and well-reviewed Dead Space.  Second, we are confident that EA SPORTS FIFA will sustain and build on the strong momentum that we exited Q3 with. And third, based on our Q3 launch results, we\u2019re taking a more measured approach for the highly anticipated Q4 launches. Next, we are committed to operational excellence and being disciplined in our investment decisions. The actions we\u2019ve taken during Q3 will reduce our total H2 operating expenses by approximately $140 million. In addition, we will continue to work to prioritize, spend broadly, evaluate our real estate footprint, and focus our investments on our best long-term growth opportunities. And finally, our Q4 guidance reflects the player-first decision to shift the launch of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor to Q1-FY24. It\u2019s important to note that while it changes the timing of reported net bookings, it does not change the overall lifetime economics, nor our expectations around free cash flow for Q4 or FY24. Now, on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are revising our Q4 net bookings guidance to $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion, which reflects the shift of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor to Q1, our decision to sunset Apex Mobile and updated expectations based on Q3 trends, in particular for launches happening in the quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.  We expect operating expenses to be $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion for the quarter, approximately $80 million lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our ongoing efforts to prioritize and focus our investment. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.20 for the fourth quarter. This Q4 guidance results in fiscal year net bookings of $7.07 billion to $7.17 billion. We are also revising our guidance for operating cash flow as a result of the updated net bookings guidance to $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that results in free cash flow of about $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. For further details on our fiscal 2023 guidance, including our GAAP guidance, please see our press release. Before handing it back to Andrew, I\u2019d like to provide a few early thoughts on our fiscal 2024. As we look to next year, we see the main drivers of our business being our durable broad portfolio of live services. Our newly rebranded EA SPORTS FC franchise, Star Wars Jedi : Survivor, plus additional titles we will announce in due course.  Excluding the impact of FX, we expect mid-single digit growth on net bookings and low double-digit growth on underlying profitability. If rates remain unchanged from today, that would equate to mid-single digit growth for both top and bottom line. Our business is anchored by incredible brands, evergreen live services, high quality games, and a growing player network. We will be focused on our investments as we build and scale our business, all while delivering amazing experiences for our players. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. We drove incredible engagement and delivered high quality experiences in the quarter. As Chris shared, we are being disciplined and focused on what we can control to fuel our biggest growth opportunities. We are confident in our vision for the future, and with our exceptional talent, proven IP, and growing player network, EA is operating from a position of strength. Our audiences have an insatiable appetite for interactive entertainment and are engaging more deeply with the experiences they love. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped than EA to deliver amazing games and content to inspire the world to play. Now, Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Regina, we are ready for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thank you, Andrew, Chris and Laura. I wanted to \u2013 I would hope you could provide a little bit more color. I'm trying to reconcile some of the comments, from the press release and slide deck and your comments here. On the one hand it seems like certain titles are doing extraordinarily well; FIFA, Sims, but then in your guidance, you kind of update the expectations for Q4 based here, in particular around launches in games on Q4. So it kind of implies maybe the smaller medium sized titles aren't performing.  So one, I was just curious if that's true; and two, what gives you the confidence that it's mostly macro and not competitive pressures across the other broader industry? Chris Suh : Sure. Hi Andrew! This is Chris. I could take this one. So in my prepared commentaries I talked about what we saw in Q3 and the specific trend I point to is the fact that we talked about strong player engagement and high quality titles. But I also talked about the fact that the highly rated titles didn't perform to the level that we would expect it based on historical expectations for a title of that caliber.  And so we're taking some of those learnings, and I do think that you know when we look at all the data and we analyze what we saw in terms of demand and results, we do believe that that's a reflection of the overall market conditions that we saw continued to mount throughout the quarter, and we've taken those learnings and we applied those into the Q4 guidance. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. And then just on the mobile side, what kind of learnings are you kind of taking from Apex Mobile, because it was Game of the Year, but clearly you struggled with a little bit of engagement. Is it who made it; is it the game \u2013 you know it\u2019s just too PC based? Could you share kind of the learnings that you've taken away to determine why to cancel this one and cancel the Battlefield title? Andrew Wilson : Yeah, great question, and I do believe we've learned a great deal as we've gone through this. Certainly, this game was in development for a long period of time as the expectation for the size and scale and complexity of mobile games continues to grow as the platform continues to mature over time.  As we look at it, we really kind of compartmentalize into a few key categories. First, as you point out, this was a really good game built by really good teams, and it won game of year on both Apple and Android devices, which is an extraordinary achievement given the amount of games that are made.  But a couple of things also were true inside of that : One is, there is a level of immersion and complexity to Apex Game Play in particular, which is very much about what Apex is about, verticality of game play and team based play that didn't translate quite as well to mobile devices as we had hoped. I think we've learned a great deal from that.  Second is, the game while it really engaged the core deeply, and it actually attracted a lot of new users, which we think speaks volumes for the future success potential of the franchise, it didn't retain the more casual user at the rate that we needed it to, and in a game that relies a lot on team play and competitive play, liquidity of the overall player base is really, really important as you think about the future experience of players over time.  And then third, I think the mobile market continues to be challenging, and we certainly saw \u2013 you know we launched into what was a soft mobile market, and with some changing and evolving kind of player personalities as we move through.  So as we think about this on a go forward basis, we take those learnings and we apply the real strengths, which is we know Apex has incredible demand from both the core users and new more casual users. We know that we have the underlying ingredients to make an incredible game. We need to be thoughtful about the nature of the core game mechanics and the retention mechanics that we build into the game over time, and most importantly, as we look at the mobile market, the biggest new launches that are seeing the most success are the ones that are deeply connected to the broader franchise, where there's not always cross play, but it's certainly cross progression and a feeling that they are part of a single unified community and a single unified game experience.  And so as we think about that for the future, that will be very, very important as we reimagine Apex Mobile. And certainly as we had those learning from Apex Mobile and we were developing into Battlefield Mobile, we anticipated that while Battlefield had also been in development for some time and was making good progress, given the construct of that game, it also was probably going to run with some of the same challenges, and rather than continue to push against that, we wanted to come back, take a breath, reset and really think about the broader franchise strategy and allow the leadership to build a true cross platform immersive game experience around a reimagined battlefield in the future.  Both of these things represent strong learning opportunities for us, and both of these things represent an ability for us as a company to lean into two great franchises in a way that the mobile market is more aligned to for the future. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. I really appreciate that color. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe building on Andrew's questions, so I want to come back first to mobile. You know how do you think about the array of type of content you have on the mobile side, and how much of it is potentially exposed to sort of casual play that might act in a more sort of hyper sort of volatile mode as consumer monetization might be volatile, depending on what happens with consumer spending going forward, versus maybe some of your sports titles and mobile that have a very different trajectory from a spend perspective. So I want to sort of broaden out the conversation to what you're actually seeing on the spend side across an array of mobile that really runs the gamut first.  And then second, I think we've seen a lot of folks in the industry talk about pushing titles out, out of \u201822 now and into \u201923 and calendar \u201923 and maybe even calendar \u201924. Is there a broader theme emerging around getting titles right before they launch, or are there elements where you need to see the council cycle possibly be maybe deeper into what it's happened over the last couple of years to maybe see the success. You want to see with some of the titles.  How should we think about the broader narrative around content being pushed out across the industry and with you guys idiosyncratically? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Okay, that is two solid questions. Let me start and then maybe Chris and Laura can provide some color as we get in. First off on mobile, I think a few things that we start with, and certainly I think that we, you know we think through on a daily basis, which is while the mobile market continues to be a very challenging market to find success in, it also continues to be the world's largest gaming platform and certainly has the ability to attract more plays than any other platform. And so for us it will always be a very important part of our go forward franchise strategy.  When we think about mobile broadly, we really think about the titles fitting into two key categories. The first category is what you speak to in the connective sports, but it's also true for Sims and Apex and Battlefield, and will be true for Skate, which is how is it part of a broader cross platform global community of play, and how do we unite and unify global communities of players around their core IP regardless of where they play on PC, mobile or console.  This for us represents probably our strongest opportunity in mobile and certainly where you'll see us begin to really invest. When you look at what's been happening with FIFI up triple digits, it's really as we've started to bring the mobile title closer to the core franchise and start to operate it as a singular business with a unified play community around the world. It\u2019s how we're building for Skate, it\u2019s how we're going to build for the future of the Sims, and with these decisions around Apex and Battlefield, it\u2019s also how we\u2019ll build for those franchises.  That represents an extraordinary opportunity for us to attract a much bigger global community to our biggest IP. It represents an opportunity to grow monetization on the mobile platform, but it also represents an opportunity to provide alternative ways for our existing core audiences who plan console and PC, to play when they are away from those core devices they have. And as we look at the mobile market on a go forward basis, we think that that will be where we\u2019ll find real strength for that part of our business. The other part is, the stand alone mobile native titles, and we have a number of titles that continue to perform exceptionally well. Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims, some of the titles that we got as part of our Glu acquisition, Golf Clash. We'll continue to invest in those as well, but you should expect that as we think about the future, we're going to really lay our investment into our bigger franchise play. We will continue to drive the long term value of our existing standalone mobile titles and will probably invest less in new startup standalone titles, just because we think that's probably not where we will find strength in the industry over time.  To hit your second part around title launches, and certainly I think we're hearing more about that across the industry, and I just, I\u2019d separate what you are hearing from us with everything that you're hearing around the industry broadly. While it might be \u2013 it might make sense to kind of draw a broader narrative, I think for us as we look at it, we launched a number of titles in Q3 and Q4 certainly with Dead Space and Need For Speed and NHL some of our smaller titles, and FIFA and Madden, we've launched an incredible amount of titles on time and at tremendous high quality. I think what we saw with Jedi, was this is an incredibly large game. It's you know both, immersive and creative and innovative, and the team just have come down the home stretch and really want to get to quality. And when we think about quality, quality is really a combination of three things : Innovation, Creativity and Polish. And that last element Polish, the removal of bugs and the removal of potential play frustrations is as important as the innovation and the creativity itself.  And so as we look at our future, we feel that we've been executing extremely well till this point, around the titles and the title updates that we've been launching. We also feel incredibly bullish and positive around the trajectory of Jedi. And when the team came and sat down and said, \u2018Hey, if you let us have just a few more weeks, we think we can deliver even higher quality.\u2019  We really wanted to get behind and support them. After all, this is an incredible team with the first iteration of the franchise that they launched. They broke all kinds of records. They are deeply committed to the franchise, deeply committed to our partners at Disney and deeply committed to our players, and we really wanted to get behind them and support it, especially as it will not impact the overall health of the franchise. In fact, it will not only last with a better quality, but almost certainly increase the lifetime value of the franchise over time. Eric Sheridan : Thanks Andrew. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju : Okay, thanks. So Andrew, you know we do have a bit of a setback in the transition to mobile, given the developments across Apex and Battlefield. So naturally this makes us worry a little bit more about how Glu was coming along, because the thesis at the time of the acquisition was to bring some of the success that has had in the more, shall we say the casual sports franchises in exporting that dynamic of FIFA, Madden, etc. So can you update us on your progress there?  And I guess FIFA Online 4, triple digits, that's a pretty remarkable result, and I presume there will be a lot of that is due to the World Cup. So you know, what do you think the Nexon and/or the Tencent team are doing right, you know to properly monetize the World Cup, and I think you know the recent \u2013 I guess, shall we say the last four to eight years, we have not had sort of an equivalent amount of growth in FIFA around the World Cup. So I'm just wondering if there are some learnings or best practices that you can export out of Korea and China into the western world \u2013 the World Cup. Thanks. Laura Miele : Hi Stephen! This is Laura. I'm going to take the Glu mobile question. As Andrew framed earlier, we still perceive the mobile market to be significant. It's a $100 billion. It's where Gen Z and Gen Alpha play. It's the platforms they prefer. It's also a significant platform in growth geographies around the world where we are looking to expand our franchises, so incredibly important market.  And as it relates to Glu, we see the genres and markets in the shooter category, the sports category, the casual creation category where females primarily play. So \u2013 and of course the Glu content fits very well into these genres and these categories in the mobile market that are still growing and where we still see a strong connection. Glu is fully integrated into EA and EA\u2019s mobile teams now, and so as we think about our future of Sims, we of course consider Cabot Fashion Design Home as part of that ecosystem as Andrew has referenced. We think about tapped sports and the potential that we have globally around our sports business. Those are a meaningful part of our growth there. And we also have had some strong talent, some good tech have been integrated into our overall EA mobile business.  So the integration and the transition has happened, and we really consider and look at the mobile business within EA in a very whole way. Andrew Wilson : And then as we think about FIFA broadly, and more importantly as we think about FC and you think about the growth in that business. I think we should think about it on three vectors. The first vector of course is World Cup, and certainly we saw very strong growth in our business coincided with the World Cup.  The good news about the World Cup, and we've been tracking this for many World Cups as you might imagine, is it's not a moment in time. It actually establishes new fans and brings more people to football. And while we had some incredible matches during this World Cup and we saw, you know incredible final that pitted Messy versus Mbappe, you know what that does is establish a whole new set of fans for football on a go forward basis. And so while certainly World Cup was a boost for us, we expected that will create an ongoing benefit over the course of time.  The second part of the growth though, it wasn't just about World Cup. It was the incredible titles that our teams launched, and certainly with what we did in the core FIFA franchise was our biggest and most innovative FIFA yet, with all that we did in and around FIFA Mobile, which was up triple digits, and all the new event content we put into FIFA online and how we really tied that community together into a global football ecosystem, you know interwoven into the fabric of football fandom, that's a really important part of growth.  And what we're seeing now is that we have fans coming into the experience, not just about experiencing one event or one team or one league, but fans coming to experience really to share their love and passion for football with their fans, and really to put it on the line against their rivals. And so as we think about what the teams have been able to do, we expect that that will continue to drive more growth for us over time.  The third one is football more broadly, and if you really track what's going on in the world, football in every part of the world is growing. It was growing before the World Cup, and it's certainly growing post the World Cup. Premier league, La Liga, League One, MLS, all these leagues are growing in popularity globally, and if you look at what happened for us, we nearly doubled our units in North America FIFA. That represents a significant opportunity for us in this incredibly sports hungry market. And so if you take those three things and then you roll that into EA Sports FC that we will launch later this year, where we have significantly more control over the nature of the experience and the things that we can do for fans, we can work more closely together with our partners at a league level, at a team level, at a player level. We think that well beyond this World Cup and certainly through many World Cups to come, the growth in football for us represents an extraordinary opportunity. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Omar Dessouky : Hey guys! How are you doing? In the past you've given high level assumptions as to your expectations for the growth of the PC and console videogame software market, and I was wondering if you have assumptions for 2023 as to how much they might grow? A - Andrew Wilson : I don't know that we have given direct assumptions on those markets in time. We may have represented some market data that had been shared with us over time. We don't have anything to share specifically at this moment, other than what I would say is what we're hearing from our partners, particularly in console, is that a lot of the constraints around their ability to get product to market is pretty much behind us, and that we should expect a fairly strong console supply in the coming quarter and the quarters through the rest of this year.  So that represents a great opportunity for us. We don't yet know how to quantify that. We know that we've been selling into what has been a relatively constrained console market. The demand is incredibly high. The good news for us as we continue to launch quality software and you combine that with what we believe, we\u2019ll be unconstrained supply of consoles. We think that positions us well in the coming year with respect to our core HD market. Omar Dessouky : Okay, thank you. And for Chris, so if I just look at the full year guide of around maybe midpoint about $7.1 billion and about $7.750 billion, which is the guide you guys gave last quarter, I see a difference of 650. If I were to subtract this quarter you know versus your guide and you know I would get about $500,000 or $1 million of push out. You know that \u2013 and of course the Apex Legend. So if I subtract 130 for the under performance in the quarter, and then let's say 20 or so for under performance or cancellation of Apex Legends or sun setting of Apex Legends, I get about $500 million left and obviously that $500 million subtraction is not entirely Star Wars.  So I was wondering if you could break that down for us. So how much of that roughly $500 million that I'm seeing is Star Wars versus FX impact versus the PC console titles that you think might be softer in Q4. And especially on FX, it looks like the British Pound and the Euro are up about 10 points versus when you guided in November, which would suggest that FX impacts should have been positive. Thanks. Chris Suh : Okay, got it. I think I followed all your numbers Omar, so let me see if I could help. So I think directionally if I followed your math, your math is sort of futs, if I could put it that way. The drivers for Q4 and consequently for the full year are in fact the exact drivers that I talked about previously, which is first and foremost the shift of Jedi from Q4 and into Q1 of FY \u201924, that's the most significant impact on the Q4 number.  Secondly, as you pointed out, the performance in Q3 relative to our guidance, that's the next one. And then by extension of that which Andrew asked as well earlier, which was what did we take in terms of learnings from Q3 and how are we applying the current macro environment and the current market conditions against what we know to be high quality launches in Q4, and that\u2019s part of the equation as well into Q4. And then the fourth one as you pointed out is the sun setting of Apex Mobile. So those are the four primary \u2013 I think you have the four primary drivers and that equates the revision in the guidance in Q4. Omar Dessouky : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Benjamin Soff : Hey! Thanks guys. I was wondering if we could dig a little bit deeper into the trends that you're seeing in Apex. And within that context, what's your view on whether or not the industry is getting more competitive as a whole, in addition to the macro environment getting a little bit weaker. And then I just wanted to see what you guys thought about, you know whether or not this is a franchise we should expect to continue to grow in the future, you know given your early color for fiscal \u201924. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yeah, so I think that you know as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Apex is traditionally a little quieter in Q3 as the live service ebbs and flows with a launch slate of new titles around the holiday. I think this was a very strong launch holiday slate, including you know FIFA which performed very well during a World Cup, and certainly there were some competitive titles that were very strong \u2013 that had been very weak in prior years quite frankly. And so there was probably a little built up demand around some of those competitive titles.  And so, while you know the franchise still performed incredibly well, just not quite as well as we had expected based on our projection of where the competitive landscape would be. And we're already starting to see a resurgence of engagement in the franchise, which is again typical of Apex, and we're coming up to a four year anniversary, and we've got a season launch update coming, and we feel very, very good about where the franchise is going. I believe the franchise will continue to grow. We've got a lot of new things that we can do. While mobile isn't going to be the growth vector today, it will be a growth vector in the future. There's new geographic expansion that we will go to. There will be modalities of play, that the team will \u2013 you know additional modalities of play that the team will investigate over the course of time.  As we've always said, we think about this as at least a 10 year franchise. We're just coming up to the fourth anniversary. It's an incredibly successful franchise. Our community is very dedicated to it, very highly engaged. Our expectation is that we\u2019ll have a strong quarter, but we're also being very deliberate around how we planned for the quarter, given what we've just seen in Q3 around the macro. Benjamin Soff : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Eric Handler : Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. So you still have a very deep development pipeline going on. So I'm curious, with the cost cuts that you've made, are these temporary cost cuts, are they permanent cost cuts. And as I think about what you said about an early read for next year, sort of mid-single digit revenue and bottom line growth. Does that mean with these cost cuts, maybe you can get to a flat operating margin year-over-year. Chris Suh : Hey Eric! This is Chris. I'll sort of take your questions I think together in \u2013 I think it sort of thematically hits on similar things. So let me just talk about sort of our approach to what we've talked about on the call, which is really focusing our investments into our best long term growth opportunities. I think what you see, that we did in Q3 and Q4, as well as the inferences of what we're going to continue to do in \u201924 is a reflection of us continuing to be very disciplined about how we view and really prioritize how we view our growth opportunities.  And so they don't \u2013 you know we've been very deliberate and very careful to continue and invest in those things that will bring long term growth and really being very disciplined about the pace of hiring and some of the variable spend that applied to our \u2013 you know given the business that we see in the second half of the year.  As we look forward into \u201924, I think again, just doing the math on the early guide that I gave, if we're able to achieve the guidance or the preliminary direction that I gave to a mid-single digit top line with a better than that improvement on operating line, it would be margin improvement year-on-year in \u201924 versus \u201923 for sure. Eric Handler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Mike Hickey : Hey Andrew, Chris, Laura! Thanks guys for taking my questions. Just two from me. Thanks for the early look on your fiscal \u201924 growth opportunity. Just curious if you could speak to sort of the degree perhaps and the longevity of the macro pressure you're seeing on your players, if you think it's going to get worse before it getter better or how you think about the potential for a recession in job losses, and how that plays into your \u201924 guidance, the early look that you gave us. And then the second question, obviously you didn\u2019t give the number, but I think the FIFA license was rumored to be around $150 million annually. Curious if all that money has been spent as you sort of budget \u201924 in terms of right fees with the other partners and maybe incremental marketing spend. Or if you think there's some cushion there, in your forward fiscal in terms of potential savings. Thanks, guys. Chris Suh : Yeah, I could certainly take that one. As we talked about, we're operating in a time when there's greater uncertainty and greater unpredictability in the market. And we saw that in Q3. As we look forward into FY\u201924 I would say that the early direction we gave assumes really based on the best information we have now, which is you know we're not in the business of forecasting markets or GDP or macro, but we do know the trends that we see now that we executed Q3 with and that we are seeing entering Q4.  And so I would say that the best way to think about FY\u201924 is that the underlying market assumptions that are neither material improvement nor material worsening in that macro environment that we're operating in. And then obviously, as we continue to go on and get closer to the quarters, we'll have more certainty with the out quarters that we are looking at. In terms of the FIFA math associated with the license fees, you know the way that I would encourage you to think about it is that, in FY \u201924, it's such an important transition year for what is, our biggest franchise, and our focus is really about making sure that we build the greatest experience in terms of bringing the players along with us in the journey. It never has been solely about the profit margins associated with this transition, and so we are completely focused on making the transition in the launch of EA SPORTS FC a really fantastic experience for players. Andrew Wilson : The one piece I would add to that around that, and concur with Chris, it's not so much about what did we pay fee for or what won't we pay fee for the future. I think that we will invest meaningfully into the franchise to grow it through this phase. Again, we have really said this is not just about a change of the sign on the front of the game, but a real sign of change in terms of what we offer the players over time. And we do believe that we can offer a bigger, more comprehensive, more immersive global football fan experience within our games and beyond the bounds of our games, working with our great partners around the world.  And as we think about investing in that in \u201924 and maybe even deeply in \u201925, we believe it will pay meaningful dividends over the course of time. This is a franchise that we've been investing in for 30 years. I couldn't be more excited about the next 30 years of the franchise, and what we'll be able to do. And so I think our focus right now is really how do we set ourselves up to realize the fullness of the potential of developing the preeminent interactive football fan community in the world. Chris Evenden : We\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : Your next question, you will come from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Cost : Hi everyone! Thanks taking the questions. Just on some of the commentary about mobile, you've talked about some challenges in the mobile game industry and some macro headwinds. I guess you know at this point we're a fair bit of the way, maybe a year into weakness in the mobile market. Are you seeing a real differentiation in terms of the stickiness and the predictability of your players on the PC and council side versus mobile, that's question one.  And then the second one is just, can you quantify the guidance impact of delaying Star Wars into the next fiscal year? Thanks. Laura Miele : Hi Matt! On the mobile sickness as you said, we measured certainly by engagement. And I would say it varies across the mobile experiences we have. As we've discussed our strategy and how we are thinking about the future, it\u2019s really around how the mobile platform can contribute to the overall connected ecosystems of franchises and what we're seeing, as in Andrew mentioned, as players play on the go, as Gen Z and Gen Alpha market, you know addressable market expands as every year goes by, it\u2019s going to be very important for us to show up on the right platforms for the right moments and right experiences.  So we're seeing in some of our, as we discussed on FIFA Mobile is we've had we have significant engagement and significant acquisitions into this franchise, because of the mobile game that we have. And that's how we're really looking at the incredible assets that we have around casual creator games for our Sims products, our sports games and really dial that up to connect into the ecosystems, because they can be a meaningful contributor of new players, engagement and connection into a high def experience. Andrew Wilson : Great! And Matt, let me jump in on the question about the guidance. So as we talked about in some form in some of the other questions, the move of Jedi to Q1 is the most material driver of the Q4 guidance revision, And it\u2019s a significant part of the full year revision as well, depending on which wins that you're taking a looking at the at the guidance numbers. Again, just again reiterating that from a lifetime economic standpoint, the move to Q1 is better for the overall game, the ecosystem and for the brand, and again importantly, given the timing of the original launch in March versus now in April, it doesn't change our cash flow forecast for Q4 nor for FY\u201924. Matthew Cost : Great! Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. David Karnovsky : Hey! Thank you for fitting me in. Chris, you noted your forward view is based on trends currently or where you exit in Q3, but wondering if maybe you could speak just to the phasing of kind of the economic impact through the fiscal third quarter. Did you see player engagement or monetization kind of change at all? Was there anything specific to call on the holiday period. And they're just given the news around Apex and Battlefield, any update on Lord of the Rings, that you still plan to launch this game, you know anything you could say around the soft launch? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Great, okay, and I'll start and then turn it over to Laura to talk about Lord of the Rings. The shape of the quarter, and I think you know, in some of the materials, we talked about how uncertainty mounted throughout the course of the quarter, and I think that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s probably a good reflection of what we saw, and it is a quarter where the results were mixed. Where we were continuing to watch the strength in FIFA, the strength and FIFA that occurred throughout the quarter, and in particular at the end of the quarter. And then we were also watching the performance of these high quality titles, and how they launch in the market reception to that and both from a player, and a reviewer, as well as a monetization standpoint.  So I'd say we were, understanding, absorbing and analyzing you know different data points throughout the course of the quarter. But as I talked about, in particular the things that led to the our performance in Q3 and the extension of that into Q4 were specifically related to high quality launches and the pattern I would say of recognition of what we would expect in terms of return, versus launches of that caliber, and that was very specific to the titles that launched on those dates in the quarter, as well as just the macro, I would say market gravity that we saw across smaller titles throughout the quarter. Laura Miele : Hi David! To answer your question about Lord of the Rings Mobile. As a reminder, this is a team that created Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which has been one of our most successful mobile games, and we're over $1 billion in net bookings on that. They are currently actively working on Lord of the Rings and soft launch currently and so we expect a full launch on that mobile game this coming year. Andrew Wilson : Okay. So thank you all for joining us for this quarter. We appreciate the support. We appreciate the good questions and the engagement today, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : That will conclude today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Stuart. I hope all of you are well. I want to start by sharing how inspired and proud I am of our teams. Against macro uncertainty and constant change, we navigated the year with resilience and determination. Throughout fiscal year 2023, we showed the strength of our business, delivered for our players and lived up to the promise of our values. To every EA employee, thank you.  Over the fiscal year, we executed across our business, delivering high-quality games, launching 7 new releases and providing over 450 content updates across 51 titles. Consumer appetite for interactive entertainment experiences is at an all-time high. And with our player network expanding to nearly 700 million, we delivered record engagement across some of our biggest franchises. EA is leading the future of interactive entertainment in a dynamic industry where new audiences, new technology and new media trends are reshaping the world around us. Consumption of sports and entertainment is accelerating, and media trends are evolving. We see these transformations as immense opportunities to do more amazing things for our people and our players.  As we look to the future, we're focused on delivering against 3 key strategies : building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, creating blockbuster interactive storytelling and amplifying the power of community in and around our games with social and creative tools. Executing these strategies across the modalities of play, watch, create and connect will lay the foundation for long-term growth as we write the next great chapter of EA story. Fiscal year 2023 was an amazing year for EA SPORTS FIFA with the entire ecosystem producing incredible results. Console, mobile and PC both premium and free-to-play, delivered double-digit growth in net bookings, and FIFA 23 became the best-selling title in franchise history. Our interactive experiences are at the heart of global football culture and fandom and are a testament to a strategy sharpened by 30 years of passion, creativity and innovation.  Fiscal year 2024 stands to be another important year for EA SPORTS. We will build on the massive momentum in our global football ecosystem, delivering expanded enhanced experience for fans, EA SPORTS FC. In April, we unveiled the brand identity and vision for EA SPORTS FC. By every measure, this was the biggest brand moment ever created at EA, reaching billions of potential players generating thousands of media hits within days and inspiring record positive sentiment amongst our players with the support of hundreds of partners, athletes, leagues, federations and clubs. With EA SPORTS FC, we are building a fan-first future for global football, and we cannot wait to share more in July.  Already, the world's permanent American football experience, Madden NFL delivered an extraordinary amount of content in and around the game in fiscal year 2023, driving deep engagement and becoming the best-selling title in this franchise's history on console and PC. Madden NFL 24 will build on this excitement, offering even more fun and immersive game play. Our fourth quarter saw a resurgence in Apex Legends performance. Season 16 powered by massive game enhancements like a new class system transformed the way core Legends played. Our strong community of players responded favorably, lifting peak engagement more than 20% from the previous season. The resilience of Apex Legends reinforces its unique position as an IP with a power to consistently entertain players as they play, watch and compete in an evolving world. Throughout fiscal year 2023, Apex entertained an average of 20 million monthly active users. This player loyalty is fueled by responsibility to continuously expand and improve the player experience.  No other game in the industry celebrates creativity and individuality quite like The Sims. This diverse and passionate community has fueled imagination and champion self-expression since its launch in 2014, growing to over 70 million players worldwide and counting. Our talented team at Maxis Studios is using the power of creation and connection to shape culture, developing new experiences for The Sims 4 to take entertainment to unimaginable heights.  To continually inspire the world to play, we are focused on blockbuster storytelling. Our history and leadership of bringing together culture-defining IP with interactive entertainment creates incredible opportunities to build an unrivaled portfolio bolstered by powerful collaborations. These are fundamental ways to bring more players into our global network through the lasting power that only blockbusters can deliver.  Just 11 days ago, we delivered on this priority with the launch of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. This incredible game has received widespread positive reviews earned an 86 Metacritic score on console and has been called a Game of the Year contender by multiple press outlets. Our dev teams are working with the community around some high-end PC specs. And beyond this, it has been a strong launch. Within the first few weeks, millions of players have joined Cal Kestis and BD-1 in a rebellion against the empire. Star Wars Jedi : Survivor is storytelling at its finest, which is central to the game's success and to our creative collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and Lucasfilm. The game is pure blockbuster entertainment and fans have embraced the story of our Jedi games as a central part of the Star Wars saga, demonstrating how great interactive entertainment can grow and deepen the fandom of an incredibly powerful IP universe.  Games are the social networks of the future. To amplify the power of community, we are innovating across a set of social and creative tools in and around our games. Our strategy is to help players make new friends, build their social network and create community. These in-game social experiences were rolled out in FIFA 23. Among players that are interacting with a new feature set, engagement increased over 150%. Our data shows these innovations are driving results in our business and confirm what we know to be true : having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting. As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio. With a strong close to fiscal year 2023, we are executing on our core strategies, and our focused investments are positioned to drive results across our content and services pipeline. We remain committed to capturing our biggest opportunities and delivering long-term value in our business by doing more amazing things for our players and communities.  Now I hand the call over to Chris to provide additional details on our business. Christopher Suh : Thanks, Andrew. And hello, everyone. Our fiscal year 2023 results again demonstrated the fundamental strength of our portfolio, the resiliency of our live services business model and our ability to execute in a disciplined manner. We again outgrew an uneven market, took decisive actions to sharpen our focus and finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter performance.  Our fiscal year was highlighted by significant milestones across our portfolio. In the 6 months since launch, EA SPORTS FIFA 23 has surpassed lifetime sales of EA SPORTS FIFA 22. Apex Legends continued to engage players around the world and following our decision to make the base game free to enter in October, The Sims hit historic engagement highs with tens of millions of new players in the community.  Throughout the year, we continue to take deliberate actions to focus our company and align our business more closely with the strategic priorities that Andrew outlined, culminating with the actions we announced in late March to rationalize our games portfolio and optimize our real estate footprint. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a charge of $155 million, with the remaining charges to be recognized during the first half of fiscal 2024.  For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.9 billion, up 11% or 15% in constant currency. Our results exceeded our expectations and reached a new fourth quarter high, driven by a record live services performance and strength in full game. EA SPORTS FIFA significantly outperformed as net bookings grew 31% year-over-year or up 37% in constant currency. Apex Legends also delivered a stronger quarter than anticipated as players returned for Season 16 in our fourth anniversary collection event.  Our live services net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 9% or 13% in constant currency, significantly outperforming our expectations as EA SPORTS FIFA live services delivered a record quarter. FIFA Ultimate Team net bookings grew 20% year-over-year or up 26% in constant currency and saw all-time high engagement. FIFA Online 4 was up 62% or 71% in constant currency, and FIFA Mobile grew triple digits year-over-year and reached its first $100 million net bookings quarter. Apex Legends saw improved performance following a competitive third quarter, rebounding to a low single-digit year-over-year growth quarter in constant currency. And The Sims 4 exceeded expectations as a new expansion pack and free base game updates resonated with the growing community.  Our mobile business, excluding the strong FIFA mobile results, stabilized and delivered in line with our expectations. Our strategy is focused on enhancing player experiences by connecting our largest brands across platforms, delivering blockbuster mobile experiences and optimizing our portfolio for profitable long-term growth. We delivered fourth quarter net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases. These increases were partially offset by prudent management of other variable spend.  Now let me talk about our full year performance. Our net bookings were $7.3 billion, down 2% or up 1% in constant currency, outperforming uneven market conditions and industry headwinds in mobile. Our net revenue was $7.4 billion for the year, and diluted EPS was $2.88. We generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Now let me turn to the outlook. Our fiscal year 2024 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in fiscal year 2023. We expect engagement across the portfolio to remain very healthy and our highly reoccurring live services business to show great resilience again. We continue to operate in a competitive market with changing macro conditions. And as such, we will continue to be focused, deliberate and disciplined as we execute against our strategic priorities.  For FX, if rates remain unchanged, we expect a headwind of nearly 2 points for net bookings and 6 points for underlying profit growth, net of hedges relative to last year. We expect fiscal 2024 net bookings to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year or up 1% to 7% in constant currency, built on a strong foundation of our evergreen live services, growth in our massive online communities, the introduction of EA SPORTS FC and blockbuster story point through Star Wars Jedi : Survivor.  We expect EA SPORTS FC to deliver low single-digit net bookings growth, building on its momentum growing again on top of a record fiscal year 2023. We expect cost of revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting gross margin expansion, driven by a mix of revenue across royalty-bearing licenses, platform and digital. We expect operating expenses to be $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion with continued focused investments in our business to drive long-term growth. As a result, we expect underlying profitability to grow faster than net bookings.  We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, which expires in November 2024. We expect fiscal 2024 net revenue to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.81.  Now moving to our outlook for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for Q1 to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, up 15% to 23% or up 19% to 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by full game sales of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. For the first quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $350 million to $370 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.14. Our business is in a strong position propelled by strong brands, massive online communities, blockbuster storytelling and evergreen live services. Our efforts over the last year to align our teams more closely with our key priorities has led to a more focused scope of work, which will help us deliver on our multiyear growth aspirations.  Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. Interactive entertainment is at an inflection point. The industry is expanding, the number of players expect to grow significantly over the coming years. The audience is becoming more diverse with cultural and generational trends accelerating content consumption. Engaging this expanding player base means reaching them on devices everywhere through disruptive technologies.  For EA, these transformations represent opportunities to grow today and over the long term. We have the best talent in the industry to execute against our long-term strategy. It's through their passion and creativity that we will continue to deliver on our mission to inspire the world to play. We are focused on bringing more amazing games to more people around the world, inspiring them to build community, celebrate shared fandom and have joyful experiences. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped to lead this transformation than EA.  Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Andrew Uerkwitz : I've got one kind of on June and then kind of a big picture question. Chris, could you help me reconcile a little bit the June guidance? I think a year ago, you had one title. In the June quarter, you have 5 this time. And then clearly, there's some strong momentum in live services. So is this cautious guide? Is this -- is there something in the live service momentum that slows down? Just a little bit more color you can give on June would be great. Christopher Suh : Andrew, so you're talking about the -- our guide for Q1? Andrew Uerkwitz : Q1, yes. Yes, sir. Christopher Suh : Yes. Right. So specifically, our guide in Q1 is driven really by the performance of our live services business. And as you pointed out, we have some year-over-year things on new launches that are driving that performance. Andrew Uerkwitz : It seems like 5 games should drive more than a couple of hundred million dollars, right, if I'm doing my math right? Or is it just in -- go ahead. Christopher Suh : No, sorry. And we're happy to sort of take you through sort of line by line on that. But it is relative to the size of the launches, I think, that you're referring. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Okay. That's great. Yes. And then just kind of big picture, some of the trends that I think you saw in the previous quarters around kind of weakness in smaller titles, I think you guys or some of your peers called out this idea that gamers are kind of coalescing around the biggest titles. Are you still seeing that? And then secondarily, and maybe more importantly, how has that impacted where and how you invest in future titles? Andrew Wilson : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. I think it's a great question. As we look at the marketplace and as we look at consumer trends, I think there's 2 things happening right now. One, which -- and both kind of end us in the same place. But I think one is more short term, and one has as much longer term -- more longer-term ramifications.  The first is that any time through the history of our industry, that there is any kind of consumer softness or consumer trepidation around spending also macroeconomic uncertainty. What we typically see is consumers move towards the biggest brands and the biggest titles and the most recognizable experiences. And that really comes down to kind of general consumer behavior, which is they have less money that they're willing to risk against new things or smaller things or unknown things. And typically, our brands like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims have performed very well at these times.  That, however, is a moment in time. And our expectation is that as we move through this particular phase and as consumer spending continues to strengthen over time, that there will be opportunities for new titles and new brands. What -- but what we don't think that will outweigh is this movement to these broader social ecosystems that are games, games as platforms. At the very call, we are a games company, but what we are seeing is the evolution of the definition of a game. And you hear us talk about play, watch, create, connect. And it's really that last piece, that connection piece, that is driving the future of our business. And as we think about building FC for the future, as we think about building The Sims for the future and Battlefield and Apex and Skate and other properties in our portfolio, we really think about that in the context of building games as a platform or content as a platform to drive these long-term businesses across play, watch, create, connect. We think this will be longer-lasting than the present kind of macroeconomic climate. And certainly, that's where we're investing in meaningful parts of our time, money and resources over the coming years. That's not to take away from the opportunity to launch incredible things like Jedi, which we've just done, which tell unbelievable stories in an interactive world and become a meaningful part of a bigger brand IP like we have with Star Wars. But certainly, as we balance out our investment over time, a great portion of our investment will go into these building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities. We'll then follow up with a more focused, deliberate investment against telling blockbuster interactive stories, and we think that there will be opportunity for investment over time with the extension of these social and credit tools, both for the in-game experience and beyond the game experience broadly. And you'll see us do some more of that, particularly in the world of EA SPORTS in the coming year. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Benjamin Soff : Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expectations for FC. Obviously, you guys had a record year for the franchise, and you're expecting low single-digit growth in the upcoming year. So I just wanted to better understand the drivers there and if you see any challenges or execution risks that you go through the rebrand. Andrew Wilson : I'll touch on this broadly, and I'll let Chris kind of talk a little bit more on the details of how we're forecasting and planning. First and foremost, we're coming off an extraordinary year. Football as a sport is growing globally. We think the World Cup did great things for continuing to grow the sport broadly and the fan ecosystem around the sport. I think what we've been able to do with our football franchise is really become central to the fabric of football culture, and the results that you are seeing is really demonstrative of that importance that we play in that fan football culture.  My belief and my belief all along has been that as we move through this rebrand, and certainly as we talked about in the prepared remarks, this rebrand was probably the single biggest rebrand moment in the history of the company and almost certainly the most successful by a fairly wide margin. We've never seen this kind of consumer energy and this kind of positive consumer energy around a launch of this nature, particularly for a business that we've been in for 30 years.  And so I continue to believe that moving through this rebrand actually presents us extraordinary opportunities for growth, and I've talked about this before and the context of what we can do for the player broadly, how we can extend the play, watch, create, connect, experience, how we can extend the relationships that we have with commercial brands that are equally valuable in football fan culture over time. And I think that as we move through this year, and you see what we're doing in the context of the game experience and what's going on around that, we feel very bullish and very confident around growth opportunities of our football business. But we're coming off a pretty big year, and it's a pretty big comp, and so I'll hand off to Chris to kind of talk you through how we're thinking about that. Christopher Suh : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Exactly as Andrew said, we're seeing an incredible year for FIFA. We talked about it extensively on the call. Actually, FIFA for the full year across all platforms grew 20% this year in constant currency, and that's off of '22 that also grew double digits. And so the momentum in the business has been fantastic. As we look forward into the launch of FC, as Andrew said, we're really focused on the player experience and making this a great experience. We're pleased to be able to grow the business again off of 2 consecutive years of double-digit growth. Benjamin Soff : Okay. Great. And then just one on the guidance. I think last quarter, you talked about mid-single-digit operating income growth. And if I'm doing my math right, I think the midpoint of your guide implies more of a low single-digit growth rate. So first of all, is that correct? And what changed? And is it FX or maybe something else? Christopher Suh : Yes, sure. As we gave the guide at the beginning of Q4, we went through a number of planning assumptions that we shared with you in terms of what we saw in terms of player engagement and quality of games and execution. I would say the biggest difference between now and then is, honestly, the performance that we had in Q4. We had an incredibly strong Q4, exceeding our own expectations on a number of fronts that we talked about in the prepared comments. And as we look forward into '24, our outlook and our planning assumptions for '24 in many cases remain unchanged in the sense that all the things that we focus on, which is quality of games, execution and delivery of our resilient live services, those remain quite stable and consistent and unchanged. And I would say that the comp is just quite a bit higher. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Matthew Thornton : Maybe first one, Star Wars Jedi : Survivor, Andrew or Chris, just wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of color -- put a little more meat on the bone, just maybe how that's faring relative to its predecessor and how to think about that title for the balance of the year. And then just secondly, on mobile, we've got The Lord of the Rings title here in the first quarter. Curious how material you think that can be to the full year. And mobile more broadly, it looks like it's starting to perk up a little bit or stabilize a little bit. Maybe just a little more color on what you're seeing in that market as we head into fiscal '24. Andrew Wilson : Yes. On the Jedi piece, and I'll let Chris touch on Lord of The Rings, maybe Laura can give you a little bit more color on the launch of that and what we expect. On Jedi, again, we're overjoyed. We made the bold decision to move the title 6 weeks to give the team the opportunity to really get to the quality of games they wanted. And of course, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the quality has been very, very strong, and many are proclaiming is going to be a game of the year contender. And certainly, playing it and speaking to people who are playing it, it represents incredible storytelling in the Star Wars universe. And so I think we're building on where we were with Jedi : Fallen Order. And we're -- and it's certainly been a very strong launch for us. It was very early. I think we're 11 days in at this point. We're in a different kind of market dynamic, but I would tell you it's pacing very strongly against our expectations and against Jedi : Fallen Order. Christopher Suh : Great. The only thing I'd add to what Andrew said about Star Wars is that as exactly as we said, we're incredibly excited about the launch. This is a title that we expect to contribute to our financial performance for a very long time. And so we're in early days.  In terms of The Lord of the Rings mobile launch, again, another title we're very pleased at in terms of the quality of the game and the expectations around it. We are being modest and prudent in terms of the underlying implied financial performance within our guide, consistent with what we've talked about in terms of launches of some of our other titles over the last couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Clayton Griffin : I had a question on Apex. I just -- I noted that Overwatch is experimenting with its first kind of IP crossover collaboration, what have you. Correct me if I'm wrong, it has not been a lever that Apex has really pulled. So I'm curious just to get your sense of the pros and cons of maybe going down that road. I don't know if it makes strategically for Apex, but just kind of the broader point is just trying to better understand kind of what you guys want to do with Apex in terms of monetization or engagement as it relates to those types of activities. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I think what you've heard from us, and certainly the performance in Q4 is testament to this, is Apex is one of the strongest franchise in our industry and certainly one of our strongest franchise when we talk about content as a platform, a game experience as a platform, Apex is certainly front and center as we think about our business model. We have a substantial player base with incredible retention. And as is the nature of these free-to-play environment, there are ebbs and flows. And I think what is unique to Apex is its ability to engage and reengage through those ebbs and flows.  We're going to continue to invest in the IP broadly, both geographically from a platform, extending play, extending story. And for what it's worth, I don't think anything is off the table. I think that as we think about game IP today, it's kind of like comic book IP of 20 or 30 years ago. This is the IP that Gen Z and Gen Alpha perhaps identify mostly with, and I think the opportunities for us to continue to grow and expand and stretch the nature of the experiences that we're able to offer to our global player base over the next decade and beyond is unfettered. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Mario. Two, if I can. So is there any color you can provide on your mobile revenue outlook in fiscal '24 that's embedded within the guide? And then separately, for EA SPORTS FC, I appreciate the call-out on the slides that fiscal '24 bookings anticipates low single-digit growth for the title. Are you expecting any margin benefit that will flow down to the bottom line now that the FIFA license has gone? Christopher Suh : Let me address your first question. I'll start there and then I sort of missed the first part of your second question, so if you could repeat that here in a second. But in terms of the mobile growth for next year, our expectations are that mobile business in aggregate will be down year-on-year after FY '23, a large part of that related to the decision to sunset the Apex mobile title, and so that obviously is in the comparable for '23. It won't be in the comparable for '24, and that's a big piece of the mobile business revenue performance expectation for '24. And can you go ahead and repeat your second question? I missed the first part of it. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, yes. Got it. So are you guys just expecting any sort of margin benefit that will flow down to the bottom line without the FIFA license for EA SPORTS FC? Christopher Suh : Got it. Okay. It's FC. I missed the part which game you're referring to. So thank you for that clarification. As we think about the transition to FC, we really are focused on the player experience and making this transition, a great one for our fans around the world. We are going to invest behind that across our brand, rebrand launching as well. And so as you think about the total economics of the business, I would not anticipate it being materially different year-on-year. Laura Miele : Mario, I'd just like to add some context -- a little bit more context maybe on how we're thinking about mobile -- our mobile growth and even our future beyond this coming year. I mean clearly, we've all have seen mobile grow in the past decade from $11 billion to $106 billion globally, which is massive and significant. But what we'd like to share is that the industry pursued that growth with the philosophy of user acquisition or development for that matter at any cost. And how we're looking at things now is that, that era is over. The economics didn't make sense, and we were really focused on -- the industry was kind of focused on the wrong things. How we are looking at it and how we -- what we're prioritizing and our new management kind of a refined approach is around profitable growth. So this means equal attention to top line and bottom line in the market and our business dynamics. It's easy, clearly, to focus on top line and just look at that growth area. But when we look at our business and our new management approach, we have seen mobile profitability across our portfolio in the last 2 to 3 years increase. And specifically, when we look at Glu, we've increased 3x from FY '22 to FY '23 and our profitability. So we're really pleased that under our management and how we're thinking about things that we are still focused on growing the overall business in a profitable way.  Now a couple of things. Andrew mentioned and have outlined incredibly well about this connected ecosystem and our connected communities. Mobile is going to play a meaningful role in that. When we look at our FIFA success, which we've talked a lot about in this call already, but it's just so strong and it's been such a meaningful contributor to the overall ecosystem, players that play FIFA HD and mobile generate a far higher daily average revenue than FIFA players who only play on just one platform. So we know that there's a meaningful contribution that mobile can play in the overall ecosystem.  The second area that we're spending a lot of time in is our existing live services. So we talked about earlier about that we launched The Lord of the Rings game clearly. And that has really modeled after our Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes game, which has generated nearly $1.5 billion over the lifetime. When we look at the market and we evaluate what's working, when you look at the top chart in mobile, the top 10 charts in mobile, only 2 entrants have come in the last 2 years. Everything else has been there for quite a long time.  So we see a pretty significant runway and continued growth potential in our existing life services. We have Plants vs. Zombies. We have Sims. We have Design Home. Clearly, we have FIFA. We have Tap Sports. We have a really meaningful live service business that we see a really strong runway and still, again, and growing that in a profitable way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : And maybe if I could go back to ask another big picture. One, obviously, there continues to be a lot of debate in the industry about distribution and content companies and vertical versus horizontal scale in the industry. Andrew, I want to know as we get deeper into 2023 and even against some of your longer-term thoughts, how are you thinking about scale, both from a distribution standpoint and from a content creation standpoint and how that factors back into possible capital allocation for the company over the medium term. Andrew Wilson : Great question. As you might imagine, we spent a great deal of energy thinking through this puzzle. I think on balance that what we have done as a company over the last 40 years has navigated various distribution modalities from cartridge to disk -- floppy disk to cartridge, cartridge to disc, disc to digital, digital to live service. And our expectation is that we'll continue to evolve, and we think we're at the forefront of that, particularly as you think about our live services business.  When we think about scale broadly, I think there are 3 core elements to scale. One is the scale of our network, the amount of players that we interact with each year and each month. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've just hit 700 million, which is an extraordinary amount of people and represents some of the greatest scale in and around our industry. The second area of scale, of course, is meaningful IP. And what we've discovered over time is that our biggest brands continue to get bigger as we invest in them and this year as we take more ownership over our football brand with FC, but certainly FC and Apex and The Sims and Battlefield and Need for Speed and so many of our great brands that there's a level of portfolio scale that gives us optionality for the future that most in our industry or an entertainment broadly, just simply don't have the benefit of.  But there's another element of our business that I think is the most important, and that's our people. The scale of teams that we have that can deliver titles and content and live services year in, year out and has continue to do that through the ebbs and flows of our industry and through the dramatic consumer trend changes and distribution changes and platform changes. Many other companies have tried. Not many have succeeded as it turns out. And as we look to the future and as we see that interactive entertainment is becoming a more and more important part of entertainment broadly, I think that our team scale is actually one of our greatest strengths. Our ability to launch the number of EA SPORTS games and updates every year, our ability to take Apex to 200 million people, our ability to take The Sims to 70 million people, our ability to bring Battlefield back in an entirely new way in the future and reinvent and rethink what Skate might be as a consumer connection platform around Skate culture.  There are very few companies, if any, in our industry or in entertainment more broadly that can do that at the scale that we can do it. And it's inherent in who we are as a company. We invest deeply in it, in the culture of our organization in really supporting creators. And I think that as we move forward in entertainment that the combination of our network, our IP and, more importantly, our teams gives us the kind of scale that means that we have unbelievable opportunities for growth and certainly opportunities for success as we embark in what will be a new competitive marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. So Andrew, as I hear you talk about the connected ecosystem as well as blockbuster franchises, it seems like the complexity to develop a really successful franchise is only ratcheting higher. And hence, there is probably a higher level of risk around all these projects as well. So do you think you will allow development teams in, say, the nonsports games, not longer lead times to make sure the quality is high and the risk to franchise damage is minimal? Andrew Wilson : Yes. I think it's a great question, and I go back to some of the comments we made earlier, which is as we think about the notion of a game, the definition is evolving pretty dramatically. And so when we think about time for development, it's not just the creation of a world or the development of characters or the telling of a story. It's really about how do we build this as a platform that drives long-term live service business over a 10-plus year period. And I think as we think about supporting and investing in and growing our creating capabilities, our development capabilities, our studio capabilities, that's really where we're investing meaningfully.  And on balance, yes, we will give them more time, and we will let them evolve how they build and what they build and how they launch their games over time. But it's really not just about the complexity of games. It's really about the changing nature of what it is that we're building, but more importantly, the changing nature of how we derive value from that development over the long term. And so where we once built games in 1 year or 2 years and then monetize them over 5 weeks or 5 months, now games as a platform are taking longer, but the benefits are exponentially greater. And what we're seeing out of FC; and what we're seeing out of Apex; what we're seeing out of The Sims, which again launched in 2014, is meaningful return over a decade's long life cycle. And as we set ourselves up for the future, that's going to be a meaningful part of how we invest in our company, how we invest in the content and service that we provide to players and how we support our development teams to do that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Michael Hickey : Just two for me. First one, just how you're thinking about industry consolidation, assuming acquisition deal gets brought here, what you think the implications are for the broader industry and on consolidation, Andrew? Second question, not intended to be softball question here, but curious on AI and development, thinking about opportunities, challenges, winners, losers. It seems like you guys have been very proactive here. Already starting to see the success of AI on development, but just curious what you're doing today, the success you're finding, early learnings and how you think about a step-up growth opportunity over the long term. Andrew Wilson : Yes, great questions. Let me touch on the first part, and then I'll hand over to Laura to provide a little bit more detail on the AI part in terms of what we're doing. So first, as it relates to consolidation, I'm sure you recognize this is a question I get asked a lot. I almost am never allowed to answer that question as it turns out. What I would say is I don't know what's going to happen with Activision and Microsoft. Again, we continue to be Microsoft's biggest partner. I think we're the #1 publisher on their platform. So whether that deal goes through or not is not really material to us broadly. We think we have the scale, again, back to our network, our IP and our talent to continue to navigate the future and lead the future of entertainment and compete in a marketplace regardless of whether that deal goes through or not.  Longer term, will there be industry consolidation? Will there be broader entertainment consolidation? If I was predicting the future over the long term, I would say that's an almost certainty at some level. I would love for us to have the scale to be a meaningful consolidator in that space. I think that we have tremendous assets with respect to the future of entertainment. But as it stands today, I think that we're indifferent as to whether that goes through or not. We feel like we have an incredible strategy. We feel like we have an incredible opportunity. And whether it goes through or not, we will continue to be the number one publisher on the Microsoft platform.  As it relates to AI, I think that, again, as an industry, we're probably going to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of AI broadly. I think that it will allow us to do what we currently do more efficiently. It will allow us to actually do more things as we think about being creators, our ability to use AI to augment our incredible teams and create even more entertainment for an audience that has an insatiable appetite for what we're doing. And then ultimately, to allow AI to help our players and our fans create content in our world represents significant opportunity for us.  One of the things that we are also very cognizant of is there are also fears around AI. Of course, the fear of displacement of the workforce is something that we read a lot about and we talk a lot about. And as we think about every revolution over the course of time from the agriculture revolution through the industrial revolution and on, there has been displacement of the workforce in the near term and then meaningful increases in workforce opportunities over the longer term. And our hope is that AI represents the same opportunity, and we're working very closely inside of our company to ensure that our people benefit in that way and actually facilitate them to do more things.  Of course, then there is the notion of ownership of data and who owns the output of these AI models. And we have the benefit being around for 40 years and having extraordinary amounts of data from which we can use, and Laura will talk a little bit more about that.  And then lastly, of course, it's this notion of what about people -- bad actors using AI. And I think what our plan will be is to work with others in our industry, others in entertainment, others in technology and others in governments and regulators over time to help the laws keep up with the pace of AI so that help consumers, our players, our fans aren't subjected to bad actors and fraudulent behavior as a result of AI in our industry. Laura Miele : Yes. Mike, great questions. And Andrew, you framed it, framed the AI picture incredibly well. There's a few things I can add. Clearly, AI has been a cornerstone of innovation for years, and we have a rich history at EA with AI. I mean as we look at this next wave of innovation and technology, we see it to be a powerful accelerator for key areas in our business. And as Andrew mentioned, we are incredibly optimistic actually about our unique competitive advantage given our scale, given our data.  Inputs into AI models will create differentiation, protecting our data for having protected IP that we can create generative content from. We have a rich library and history of assets. So we really like how we're positioned. And also keep in mind that we have great partnerships, and we talked a lot about FC today. We are -- we did a partnership with La Liga, and there's Hawkeye data that we're able to use in our game that is not going to be available -- open -- in an open public marketplace. Again, we really like our position and the advantage that we have given our history and who we are.  And we're thinking about the advantage of this next wave of technology as the accelerator in game development for players and player experience and then as we also think about truly live services at scale. So in game development, you would imagine the velocity of content, creative iteration is going to be advantaged greatly by having really smart content tools. Andrew mentioned the creator content life-like animation, real-time text to speech for players and what that will mean for them and the experiences they have. As we think about live game support at scale, there's going to be some really great imagery detection, issue detection, economic modeling that we're going to be able to apply as we continue to grow these connected ecosystem. So we are pretty optimistic and excited and inspired about this new wave of AI. Again, we have a rich history of it, and we're very optimistic about the years ahead and what it means to our business. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Douglas Creutz : Just wondered if you could give an update on how the various projects that are associated with the Battlefield IP are progressing and maybe how that plays into some of the things you said earlier about giving your big franchises time to gestate so that they're great when they come out. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I mean we don't have any date announcements or future announcements, if that's the question, certainly this time. What I'd say is I think we've put together an extraordinary creative leadership team. I know we've got the team gathering actually this week in Sweden. I had to call this morning with some of the leadership, and they're very bullish on how that's progressing. I think we've got extraordinary confidence in that team and extraordinary confidence in the progress they're making against the future of that franchise.  And I come back to we're not just building a game. We're building a platform, content as a platform, to drive live services over the decades to come. And so as we continue to move through this process and becomes appropriate, we'll share more about the future of Battlefield. But it is firmly implanted in that first pillar of our strategy : building games and experiences that attract and entertain massive online communities across platforms, across business models, across geographies. And we think that Battlefield is going to be a meaningful part of our future. And we'll share more time and share more as time progresses.  That was our last question. Thank you for being with us. Thank you again to all of our extraordinary teams who delivered an unbelievable Q4 in the face of some macro uncertainty. And we've set us up for a very, very strong FY '24. And of course, congratulations to the Jedi team having just launched an extraordinary blockbuster inside one of the biggest IPs on the planet. See you all next quarter. Operator : And that concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks Katie. It\u2019s great to be here with all of you. To begin, I want to welcome Stuart Canfield, who most of you already know. I have worked with Stuart for nearly two decades. He has been a trusted partner and valuable leader through many of the biggest transformations at Electronic Arts. I am excited to be working with Stuart as our new Chief Financial Officer, driving multi-year growth and unlocking long-term value. It was a record Q1 for EA with net bookings of $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by sustained momentum across the entire EA SPORTS FIFA ecosystem and the launch of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. During the quarter we executed across our business, launching five new high-quality titles, while providing over 145 content updates across 37 titles. Our teams continue to create the entertainment and experiences that inspire, engage, and connect hundreds of millions of players. To every EA employee, for all that you do for our communities, thank you. EA SPORTS FIFA had the biggest Q1 in our company\u2019s history. The franchise continues to deliver compelling content to our growing community, driving strong engagement and accelerating net bookings growth. FIFA Ultimate Team engaged tens of millions of fans and daily average users grew 15 %. FIFA Mobile attracted over 65 million new players in the quarter alone. FIFA Online produced double-digit growth across monthly, weekly and daily average users. These remarkable results are a testament to our incredible teams executing against our strategy sharpened by 30-years of passion, innovation, and leadership in interactive football. Star Wars Jedi : Survivor is pure blockbuster entertainment, rooted in a timeless, culture-defining IP. Our team at Respawn proudly launched this title to critical acclaim and commercial success. Millions of players have already engaged with the game, making this one of the biggest events in the Star Wars galaxy this year. Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1. Over the coming year, we will harness the community\u2019s passion and capitalize on key Star Wars franchise moments to drive continued engagement for this incredible game. Since going free to enter, The Sims 4 community continues to reach a broader global audience, welcoming over 4 million new players in the quarter. In addition to continuing to deliver new content and experiences to expand The Sims 4, the Maxis team is developing a new, innovative parallel experience that will ignite the imaginations of the next generation of players. In Q1, our mobile business delivered ahead of our expectations, driven by outperformance across our broad portfolio, including FIFA Mobile, Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes, and The Sims FreePlay. Over the last year, we focused and refined our approach to mobile. We are excited to see the results as we continue to drive for long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we launched Lord of the Rings : Heroes of Middle-Earth. Based on strong metrics, the team is tuning and balancing the game to scale user acquisition and promotion in the coming months. Apex Legends is one of the strongest franchises and live services in the industry with 18 million active monthly players and an impressive retention rate of over 70%. After a highly successful 16th season, we launched Season 17 in May with new variations of gameplay and monetization. While this new season did not meet our financial expectations, the team has applied important learnings, including new game mechanics to engage and retain players, which are already generating momentum. We will continue to reinforce the strengths of this franchise by introducing new modes of play and investing in regional marketing, as well as culturalization in key markets. Looking forward, I\u2019ve never been more excited for what\u2019s to come, as we head into the biggest sports season in our company\u2019s history. As the world\u2019s preeminent interactive American football experience, Madden NFL continues to deliver higher engagement year-over-year, an indicator of future success. This franchise is one of the most powerful IPs in all of sports and is at the center of football culture, bringing the community together in our game and beyond. We are building on a tidal wave of community excitement after the reveal of Josh Allen as Madden NFL 24\u2019s cover athlete. This completely new experience will offer more fun, more immersive gameplay, and for the first time ever cross-play to amplify the power of community as we build a connected multi-platform ecosystem around American football. On July 13th, we unveiled our vision for a new era of global football with EA SPORTS FC 24. Alongside this amazing title, we announced advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia, as well as new experiences FC Tactical mobile and FC Pro esports. This was the biggest reveal we\u2019ve ever had, generating almost double the positive worldwide response to FIFA 23\u2019s debut. Over 2.5 million people have watched the event live and on demand so far, an amazing celebration for the global football community. To secure a fan-first future for FC, we have announced new long-term, global partnerships with UEFA, The Premier League, LaLiga, Frauen-Bundesliga, Liga F, and many more. With these recent announcements, alongside our existing and ongoing network of partnerships, the game will showcase 19,000 fully licensed footballers, 700 squads, 30 leagues, and the biggest competitions. As a result, FC 24 is the most authentic, interactive football experience ever created. It\u2019s also a massive leap forward in gameplay innovation with a trio of cutting- edge technologies : Hypermotion V, PlayStyles by Opta and a revolutionized Frostbite engine. The highly anticipated release of FC 24 in September is the first giant step toward realizing a multi-experience global platform capable of connecting over a billion fans. To do more extraordinary things for our people, players and communities, our teams are building the strongest pipeline in the history of EA to drive multi-year growth. Over the next few years, we will launch numerous experiences that grow and deepen the fandom of our legendary IP. Our multi-year targeted investments toward our biggest opportunities include global titles like blockbuster storytelling from Dragon Age, incredible skateboarding gameplay and social connection from skate, and a revival of EA SPORTS College Football that celebrates the action, culture and tradition of the sport like never before. We\u2019re also hard at work on a new experience from The Sims that will transform what players can do with creativity, a sprawling action/adventure Iron Man game, a reimagination of Battlefield as a truly connected ecosystem, and the expansion of the Apex Legends universe across platforms, geographies, and modalities of play. The most recent reveal of our Black Panther project set in a massive, explorable universe marks the latest chapter in EA\u2019s collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and the Marvel Games team. To drive player engagement and deliver return for our shareholders, we will build unrivaled IPdriven platforms that entertain massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of community in and around our games. Being thoughtful and deliberate around feature sets, launch timing, and quality will lead to long-term profitability as we invest in our vision and lead the future of entertainment. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Stuart Canfield : Thanks Andrew, and hello to everyone. I\u2019m honored to be on my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. Throughout my twenty-year career at EA, I have been and continue to be inspired by our talented teams and the entertainment and experiences they create for our players. I am excited by our future, and I have great conviction that our strategy and teams will help us achieve our ambitions to lead the future of entertainment. Turning to our business, we continue to see healthy engagement and new player acquisition across our portfolio and have started the year strong. Today, we are reaffirming our full year net bookings outlook. I\u2019ll now speak to our Q1 results. Net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, or 25% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength in EA SPORTS FIFA and the release of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. This is the second record quarter in a row for EA SPORTS FIFA, with year-over-year growth accelerating from Q4, as this entire franchise continues to demonstrate the strategic potential of a connected massive online community. Our full game net bookings were $401 million, up 143% year-over-year, or 152% in constant currency, primarily driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor. As Andrew noted, the title was a critical success, with performance in line with our expectations. Based on the strength of the IP, the engaging gameplay, and new ways to bring the title to players, Star Wars Jedi : Survivor will continue to deliver long-term value. Our live services were up 4% year over year, or 7% in constant currency. Even in a quarter with such strength in full game, live services, which demonstrates a highly resilient, re-occurring business model, were 75% of total net bookings. With ongoing innovation in EA SPORTS FIFA, Ultimate Team remains a material growth engine for our live services business, with strength across acquisition, engagement, and monetization. In mobile, net bookings were up 3% year over year, or 5% in constant currency, excluding the impact of lapping the sunset of Apex Mobile. We continue to make material progress across our portfolio as we manage our business for long-term profitability. FIFA Mobile delivered record Q1 net bookings, almost doubling from the year prior, driven by historic levels of player engagement and new player acquisition. And although early in our launch, initial metrics are promising for our new title Lord of the Rings : Heroes of Middle-Earth. Apex Legends is a highly successful original IP for EA with a strong community of loyal core players. This quarter, net bookings were below expectations largely driven by underperformance from Season 17. As an evergreen live service that is constantly evolving, our teams continue to innovate on content and introduce new modes of play to engage a broader base of players across different geographies. To echo Andrew, we will continue to invest behind the talented team at Respawn to drive long-term expansion and growth of the franchise. On a GAAP basis, we delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Operating expenses were roughly flat and below our expectations, as we shifted marketing spend for new releases, primarily EA Sports FC, to later in the year. As a result, earnings per share was $1.47, up 32% year-over-year. We delivered operating cash flow of $359 million, one of our largest ever Q1 results, and returned $377 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow is up 2% year-over-year. Now, turning to guidance. Let me start by sharing our assumptions as we think about Q2. First, our guidance assumes continuing momentum in our existing global football business in addition to a strong launch for EA SPORTS FC late in the quarter. Second, we are taking a more measured approach for Apex Legends as the teams apply learnings from Season 17 and introduce new modes of play across various markets. Third, we plan to heavily invest ahead of the launch of the fan platform for the global football community EA SPORTS FC. And finally, as a reminder, net of hedges relative to last year, we continue to expect FX headwinds. As a result of these assumptions, we expect Q2 net bookings of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, down 3% to up 3%, or down 2% to up 4% in constant currency. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, and cost of revenue to be $430 million to $450 million. We expect GAAP operating expenses in Q2 to be between $1.11 billion and $1.12 billion, up 9% to 10%, driven by marketing investment noted earlier. And we expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.72 to $0.89. Now, turning to the full-year. We are reaffirming our full-year net bookings guidance range of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5%, or up 1% to up 6% in constant currency. We are revising our GAAP operating expenses guidance range to $4.25 to $4.37 billion, driven largely by reductions in stock based compensation. As a result, our earnings per share guidance range is now $3.42 to $3.92. We are reaffirming our guidance for our other full-year metrics. We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. To conclude, our strong first quarter is a testament to our incredible brands, our evergreen live services, and our ability to deliver compelling entertainment to hundreds of millions of players around the world. As we make progress around aligning our teams behind our biggest long-term opportunities, we will continue to stay focused, disciplined, and agile to deliver multi-year growth. Now, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Stuart. EA is set to launch some of the world\u2019s most anticipated and celebrated games and experiences. At a time when our growing global community are choosing games as their first form of entertainment and primary way to stay connected with friends through shared fandom, the value and opportunity of creating interactive entertainment has never been greater. With our exceptional teams, an unrelenting commitment to execution, our world class IP, and technological advancements that will accelerate and expand our ability to deliver new levels of creativity and innovation, EA is building toward incredible growth in the years to come. Now, Stuart, Laura and I are here for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. When we look at the mobile performance in the quarter, I wanted to get your perspective on where we are in the cycle of recovery in mobile more broadly. Obviously, mobile was an area that struggled as we moved out of the pandemic and dealt with some of the challenges from the IDFA headwinds from Apple's privacy changes. And as we get deeper into 2023 and you think about growth and investing behind mobile into 2024 calendar, just more interested in how your perspectives have changed about mobile as part of the broader mix of the portfolio. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Eric. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll hand-off to Stuart. I think that we have always believe that mobile is an incredibly valuable platform for us, not just in the context of being the world's largest gaming platform and our ability to generate return from blockbuster IP that is mobile native, but also our ability to use mobile as a tool for acquiring new users to our broader ecosystems of play. And you're seeing that happen around what will be FC later this year, what is currently FIFA and what will be FC later in this year. And we're also starting to see that as we build out towards other blockbuster ecosystems around our biggest IP. As I think about the business broadly, we spent a lot of time and a lot of energy over the last 12-months, really rightsizing the cost profile of our mobile business and really driving for great efficiency and higher levels of engagement and monetization across our very broad portfolio. And certainly, through Q1, we're seeing results ahead of our expectations. Our sense is that we will have growth from here, but it is a different mobile market that we're going into. Things do take longer from launch to scale in size. And certainly, we think the biggest opportunities are almost certainly around our big, broad IP-driven ecosystems. Stuart Canfield : Eric, just to add on a couple of points there on the financial side. Obviously, we talk to in Q1 outside of the Apex headwinds, which will be there for several quarters as we lap the sunset of the title. Obviously, we're up 3% and 5% at constant currency as we saw in the script. I think how do we preface that Q-over-Q, we're seeing, to the point in the script, overperforming expectations on some of our key titles we called out Galaxy of Heroes. We talked to FIFA. We continue to roll out on Lord of the Rings : Heroes of Middle-Earth and expect that to continue to grow through subsequent quarters. We are expecting and have guided to a 1% growth in Q2 as well. So overall, we saw a stabilization in Q4. We saw acceleration in terms of the GAAP Q-over-Q in terms of declines year-over-year, and we feel well-positioned behind the strategy levers that Andrew just laid out. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you so much for the color. And you upfront ran my follow-up on how mobile and traditional play might integrate on a title like EA FC. So thanks so much. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Clay Griffin : Yes. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if -- Andrew, I appreciate the context in terms of the pipeline. I guess, wanted to get perhaps an update on College Football. There's a lot of things going on in terms of licensing and just wondering if you could just give us a sense of where that title is, I suppose? And then on FIFA, I wanted to ask, the daily active number. Just wanted to get a sense to drill down if you might be able to give us some sense of monetization impacts in the quarter at Ultimate Team. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Great. Let me take the College Football piece, and I'll hand-off to Stuart to think about FIFA in the quarter. The team is making incredible progress around college football. Again, we have a long history and an incredible legacy around building this great game in terms of the context of American football, in addition to our very, very, very famous and culturally relevant Madden franchise. College football has always played a meaningful part in gameplay in this country. The team is doing an incredible job building out what would be the future of college football. Game players really coming together and really capturing all of the action and pageantry and the difference in college football versus the NFL. I feel very confident in what the team is doing. We've certainly -- we're working through the license situation broadly. And as of now, we've got many, if not most, of the schools' license as part of our licensing platform. And we'll continue to work with the various governing bodies of the sport in the country and some key third-party partners that we have around how and when to include college athletes themselves into the game, and we'll work very closely with them. But I'm confident that this will be an incredible reemergence of our college football experience that it will capture all the action and pageantry driven by the schools and all that goes on with the schools and the conduct of this game. And I do believe that we'll find a place where we can work in lockstep with the athletes for inclusion in the game as well. Stuart Canfield : And Clay, with regards to specifically your question on FIFA, I think I'll just frame up first. I think the second successive record quarter for us with the franchise, the growth was across all platforms. We alluded to mobile net bookings almost doubling Q-over-Q. We saw double-digit growth collectively across all forms, full game through Ultimate Team, Mobile and FO4 for one of our most successful quarters in FIFA. Clay Griffin : That's great. And just to drill down again. The daily active increases, is that a function of frequency or new player or growth? How should we think about that? Stuart Canfield : On the daily side, that's really referencing a couple of pieces. One on the mobile side, in particular, as the team have continued to drive reoccurring frequency in content drops. We used to have a much larger spaced-out live service consideration. Now the teams are bringing much greater frequency and therefore greater engagement by virtue, and you're also seeing that evolve itself through the bookings and the overall performance of the mobile SKU. Clay Griffin : Great. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : One thing I would add there on mobile broadly and on live services broadly is that given that we have this broad portfolio of live services across console, across PC free-to-play, across mobile, we brought in some incredible mobile native talent with our Glu acquisition with Golf Clash. We're starting to really reconcile how to effectively drive these live services at scale. And that includes both how we build core game mechanics, how we build new modalities of play on top of those core game mechanics, how we drive user acquisition, and how we really build modalities of play and live events on a more regular basis to drive extraordinary retention in our franchises. And what you're seeing in our football franchise broadly across console, PC free-to-play and mobile and we're starting to see in the conduct of even the learnings that we've had with Apex coming out of Season 17, and what we're doing in and around mobile, really embedding this great learning that we've had as we brought new talent into the organization. And as we, as an organization, have learned to run these live services at scale, our expectation is this will continue to be a strong tailwind for us as the nature of the industry continues to change, and we operate in this new version of our industry at scale. Clay Griffin : Great. Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thanks for taking the question. I just have one short-term, one long-term question. On the short-term side, you called out Apex weakness here quite substantially in your prepared remarks, but you kept your full year guide. Is something else kind of making up for it? Or is the weakness just not that bad? But just any comment there on how to reconcile the comments around Apex and the yearly guide. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So first, let me talk about Apex a little bit, and Laura can probably even provide some more detail. Again, this is -- this extraordinary franchise, which has continued to grow and is one of the great franchise in our industry right now, and has its ebbs and flows, and we've seen its ebbs and flows. And again, if I go back to my previous comment, as a company that has been running live services at scale now for nearly two decades, we launched our first live service with FIFA Online back in 2006, we've seen these ebbs and flows in and around our live services. And certainly, we've seen that in the context of Apex. And so we come off a record-level Season 16, the team made some really interesting and creative and innovative changes in 17. That didn't meet our expectations. It's also relevant to note that we went into a very competitive quarter. We -- a few things are happening now. One is the team has worked diligently to make very quick changes and respond to community feedback and community reaction and the performance of Season 17, and we're already starting to see momentum as we go through our current quarter. But this is the nature of our business today is that we will continue to innovate at the very cutting edge of entertainment. Many of those things will work. And by virtue of the collective learning of our organization, we will almost certainly learn faster than others in the industry. But that doesn't mean that there won't be some ebbs and flows. And as we think about the long-term day of the franchise, we factor that in. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's helpful. Laura Miele : Thank you, Andrew, for the question. Just to add on to what Andrew was saying, I think he covered it well, as far as how we think about live services, experimentation, learning and responding to players. We also -- as we talked about in the opening statement, we have one of the most premier shooter developers in Respawn and in our ability and their strength in optimizing for the shooter audience. That huge strength we have has also provided a pretty significant opportunity for us as we think about new game modes and more accessibility for a broader player base. So think about us being incredibly strong with core shooter players. Again, 18 million active monthly players, over 70% retention, and we have a runway with more players around the world as the team thinks about more accessible modes, bringing in things such as bots to help new player experience and first-time player experiences. So there's a big focus on that. The second area, I would say, on Apex that the team is really focused on is just the geographic expansion. So we've had strong success in North America and Asia, and we were going to continue to evolve our strength there and look at culturalization, marketing areas of focus in other parts of the world to continue our growth. So again, good success and then more to come in that area. And then -- and we have opportunity in the third part of monetization and converting within the game play still. So even though we're 17 seasons in and 4.5 years in, we still see opportunity on monetization in areas such as IP integration, brand partnerships, evolving some of these heirlooms we have for the legends are specific to individual legends and we are looking at creating opportunities for these heirlooms and artifacts to span across all legends to appeal to broader players. So, we see still significant opportunity and growth in the franchise. And I think the team has a really good grasp and have their head around where we're prioritizing and what their focus is. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's super helpful. Yes, go ahead. Stuart Canfield : And Andrew, just to cover for you the financial-specific question upfront as well. And if I back off everything Andrew and Laura just noted, I'm just thinking about, obviously, we entered the year with a more measured approach given the prior Q3 and Q4. We know Q3 is a natural competitive window for us. Inside of how we split the year on H1, obviously, we've got record FIFA performance across the franchise and obviously, mobile is ahead of our expectations. And you should think about Q4 from a seasonality perspective, Apex being one of our stronger quarters as well. So that's how ultimately it balances back in terms of the range on the guide. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's super helpful. And then just kind of a long-term question maybe for Laura and Stuart. Is -- Andrew did a great job of kind of outlining the pipeline, and I think it's safe to say we're deep enough in a post-COVID world where maybe development is getting back to normal. Where do we stand on that? And as you kind of think about the old, soft guidance, I think, was kind of -- the goal was every year, high single-digit growth, double-digit bottom line growth. Are we getting back to the point where that's going to be normal again? Or is there -- should we expect some still lingering impacts from game delays and COVID and work from home and whatnot? Thank you. Laura Miele : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. We just recently reorganized our company into two segments -- into divisions of entertainment and sports, and we think that there is significant growth potential still in both areas. And with a vertical focus in our entertainment business, which I am currently leading, we see significant growth potential in the development of these connected game ecosystems, as Andrew outlined, in action blockbuster titles as we talked about Marvel with our Black Panther and Iron Man and Star Wars games as well. So we see a really strong combination in our strategy around these connected games and these blockbuster action games. And I would say that this is a new evolution of our strategy. So to say that we would go back to development as we once knew it, I think that we are looking forward and continue to reinvent and evolve our development approach and practices based on the opportunity, based on our new strategy, and based on the new structure of our organization. Stuart Canfield : And Andrew, just to kind of look back on the long-term financial thinking. I think, as you know, obviously, we expensed versus capitalized, and we've been in an investment cycle as we build out the multi-year pipeline that Andrew referenced in his script. I think in terms of, is it going to be sort of normalized, I think we'll continue to map through sort of timing and sequencing for both those releases. You should expect us to start to talk to that towards the back-end of the calendar year early into the next calendar year. And we know we'll give more sort of credence to timing. We want to make sure that we are really clear with our development teams and get into the quarter levels we expect. But you should expect us to get to ultimately with that multi-year pipe sort of more step functional change in the future. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, both. Katie Burke : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Cost : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess starting maybe with Andrew and Laura. Can you talk a little -- in a little more detail about the decision to reorganize the studios into the entertainment and the sports segments and what you'll be able to do differently and better now that you couldn't do before? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Let me start there, and then Laura can come in and kind of share a little about how she's thinking about the entertainment part of the company. Again, we've had this -- we are in as a company, first and foremost, around our plays. We have over 700 million in our network, and they're spending more and more time with us. And as we think about the future, serving those players in a world where they choose interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment and they choose the games and experiences that they play as the number one way to connect and stay connected with their friends. And as we think about the future of entertainment, for us, when we drive towards entertaining and engaging that audience of 700 million that we hope grows well beyond 1 billion to 2 billion over the course of time, we wanted to really think about how best to serve those players. And while we're almost absolutely or certainly have crossover between players who play FC and Apex and Need for Speed and Madden, the nature of development and the nature of how those games are built and developed is very different and is getting more different as time passes. And what we wanted to get to as we continue to scale the company, as we continue to scale our franchises and scale the live services that are born from those franchises, get to a place where we were able to empower our creative leaders even more than we have been. We've been on a move over the last five or six years to really give more power to our creative leaders to build and grow and drive their businesses with the direct connection that they have with our players. And we want -- this was the very next evolutionary step in that process and really about giving them more creative autonomy, business autonomy as they are most deeply connected and directly connected to these networks of players and these communities of players that they play with. And it was really about getting to an accelerated level of decision-making and an accelerated level of development. I think we're already starting to see the benefits of that. We've outlined our strategy very clearly. We believe that the future of entertainment is interactive. We believe that any large-scale entertainment company will need to understand and appreciate and be able to develop in the conduct of interactive entertainment for these audiences that are choosing what we do as their first form. And as we think about that building out these platforms that deliver experiences and entertainment that entertain massive online communities, this ability to tell blockbuster interactive stories and its ability to harness the power of these communities not just inside the game, but outside the game, and as we look at what's going on with FC right now, as we think about a reimagined Madden, as we think about the reemergence of college football and all that's happening across our EA SPORTS portfolio, we're seeing accelerated moves towards that. As I think about what's happening in Laura's organization and the speed at which the Respawn team has been able to respond in the context of what's happening in Apex Season 17 as we move towards Apex Season 18, as we think about what's happening for Battlefield and what's happening for The Sims, I'm really excited, because I think we're already seeing the clock speed of our organization increase. And my sense is that will mean that we will build more things, better things, higher-quality things that entertain more people around the world over time. Laura Miele : Yes, very well said. And to layer on to what Andrew has outlined is that we are -- think about we are such a talent-centric company. And when you have the incredible talent and development leadership that we do, that we're lucky to have at Electronic Arts, oftentimes, as leaders we evaluate and look at how can we remove barriers, help the speed at which they develop and how they show it for our players. So we are incredibly focused on lifting up and removing friction for our talent so they can show up for our players every day. And we've talked about it a lot on this call about being a live service company and having content and updates in learning and turning and tweaking and using our levers to show up for our players and optimize that. That requires a vertical -- more vertical organization. And it requires as little friction and as much connection to go-to-market ideas, go-to-market strategies, commercial thinking around how we show up for players, as well as the game design, as well as technology. So the more we can integrate that, the faster we can accelerate the potential of our growth. And candidly, the more unleashed and untethered our talent feels, and it's a far more gratifying experience for them, we believe. And I will just tell you, too, on the entertainment side, we were just focused incredibly like lasers on execution. And so we know we have great talent. We know we have these incredible brands in skate, Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Marvel, Star Wars. We know we have the makings of incredible product experiences. Now we have to have heads down, execute, help the teams move as quickly as they can, accelerate that through technology and support and let them run, so we can get to this growth that we know we are capable of in the coming years. Matthew Cost : Great. Thank you. And then just quickly on M&A. There was a small mobile gaming M&A deal in the news today, which is the first time that something like that I feel like has come across the radar in a while. Is there more opportunity? Are things -- are conversations maybe restarting in terms of potential acquisitions that have been paused over the past year or two? And do you see opportunity to do more? Or with Glu and Playdemic and Codemasters, you feel like you've kind of brought in what you need to bring in for now? Andrew Wilson : I think right now, we feel very good about who we are as a company and the capabilities and talent and teams and IP we have across the organization. And we have a very clear strategy and an even clearer pipeline for growth across IP and across platforms. That being said, I think we're always looking for great opportunities to drive even more growth and entertain even more people through great games and experiences in IP. And we'll continue to work and look at that over the course of time. But it's not something right now that we're actively engaged in. Matthew Cost : Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats again to Laura and Stuart. I guess, first, just following up on Apex. Maybe to put a finer point on some of the changes, Andrew and Laura, you talked about with the game. Is the expectation that we'll see in Season 18 some of that improvement in engagement given the game mechanics and the monetization there? And then secondly, just on Star Wars, just kind of curious to learn more about the plan and the expectations as we look to see that extend in terms of the lifetime of the franchise as well as live services. I think more detail there might be useful as well. Thank you. Laura Miele : Thanks, Colin. I'll take the Apex question, and then we can talk about the broader Star Wars piece next. On Apex, the way to think about it is when you -- when we have these live services, and I laid out the areas of expansion of new addressable audiences and players, geographic expansion, and then monetization conversion mechanics that will evolve over time, we think about and look at the Apex development cycle and candidly, most live services cycles as short, mid and long-term. So you will see some -- we will see some adjustments and changes in Season 18. And we expect to see even bigger, more impactful changes in 19 and 20 and into the future for the following year. So again, there's a lot the team can do and what they have levers on. And then there are some things, such as modes or changes in mechanics, that just take a longer runway to develop. Andrew Wilson : And then on Star Wars, just for my clarity, were you referring to the Star Wars Jedi franchise or Star Wars broadly as we think about the future of the IP and our ability to tell these incredible blockbuster stories in the Galaxy of Star Wars? Colin Sebastian : Yes, Andrew, I guess, leveraging the strength of the recent Star Wars games, mobile as well as Jedi, and how you foresee that over time, turning into a broader franchise with live services and ongoing engagement. Andrew Wilson : Yes. We don't have anything to announce today, but we have an incredible partnership with Disney and Lucas. We've had incredible success in that partnership across the Battlefront and the Star Wars Jedi franchise and absolutely with Star Wars : Galaxy of Heroes. Our teams are always thinking about what are new experiences that we might be able to create. Certainly, I would love to see more in the Jedi franchise over time. It's just this extraordinary game that tells us extraordinary story. And certainly, again, we may be a little biased, but our sense based on the feedback that we're getting from our community and the quality of that product, it's one of the great beats in the Star Wars Galaxy this year and will likely continue to be a very meaningful part of that Galaxy for many years to come. And certainly, as we bring it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we think there'll be another little bump there for the franchise. And so nothing to announce today other than we have an incredible relationship with Disney. We've had incredible success so far in that partnership. And to the extent that we can find new opportunities to execute against new experiences, including live services as part of that partnership, we will explore them. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Matthew Thornton : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I could. I guess, first, anything you can say or talk about just in terms of what the early indicators are telling you around the FC launch. Obviously, I still know we have a lot of the marketing still in front of us. I think the title has a couple more early access days this quarter than it did last year. But just kind of anything that the early indicators are telling you? And then just secondly, as we think about the back half of the year, just curious like any ebbs and flows that you would call out. I think you were really helpful in the prepared comments around FIFA strength and Apex needing some work throughout the year. So I think that's pretty well understood. But you've also called out a bunch of other things, Star Wars Jedi coming to prior-gen consoles. I'm not sure if that's this year or further out. You talked about The Sims parallel experience. I think we've got a FIFA Mobile major update coming later this year. So I guess just outside the frontline release, like any other ebbs and flows that we should be cognizant of for the back half of the year? Thanks, everyone. Andrew Wilson : Yes, great question. I would think about this probably in three buckets. The first is the launch went incredibly well. And certainly, that was the first moment we talked about FC. We've been building towards this for some time and working incredibly closely with our partners in a very directly connected way with our global community across console, across PC, across mobile, across geographies. So the launch went incredibly well and was nearly double the positive performance of the launch versus FIFA 23, which in and of itself had achieved some records in terms of its launch awareness and its launch access. So our expectation there is very, very strong that we've hit the right tone. We've built incredible relationships with partners so that we have all of the right license content. Everything we had before, plus more. We've got game teams across console, PC and mobile that are all innovating at the very front-line to make sure that this is not just a change of symbol, but it is, in fact, a symbol of change. And so if I combine what's happening with -- what happened at the launch and the feedback and performance of that with what we're doing in the game, we feel very good about that element. The second element I would point you towards is just the performance of the franchise broadly. We've highlighted this many times before. One of the greatest predictors of future success is both recency and depth of engagement. And on both of those fronts, the existing franchise continues to perform exceptionally well. Again, what we said in the script was it just had its second record quarter in a row. And even as typically you would see that starting to wane as there's not much going on in the world of football right now, at least cup football but for the Women's World Cup, which is doing great things in Australia, New Zealand, we would typically start to see the business wane at this point. And we're not -- we're seeing still really strong engagement and regular engagement from our community. And so that in and of itself is probably one of the greatest predictors of future success. And then third, as we highlighted in the script, we've got a giant marketing budget against this. If you're on mobile or PC free-to-play, you will wake up and your existing experience will now be FC, and you will get all of the new benefits of that. And if you're on console, we're going to be spending a meaningful amount of money. Certainly, more than we ever have done before. We are taking no risk on that front to make sure everybody that loves football in the world understands what FC is, how it applies to them and that it's coming in September. And so net of all of that, I think that if you take into account our launch, plus the quality of the games that we're making across platforms, you take into account the current engagement and recency and regularity of that engagement, and you take into account that we are literally rallying the entire company behind this launch more than we ever have in the 40-years of the company's history around any launch, we feel very good about it. Stuart Canfield : Matt, just to add on to Andrew. Just a couple of things to think about. I think are important as you think about the financial guidance. Note, obviously, we will have dynamics in timing between Q2, hence the guide, and later in the year, particularly to the investment around FC, obviously, heavily Q2 prelaunch-focused. Also, you should start to think about, to your point on FC, how we nuance the timing and recognition of revenue between Q2 and Q3. Worth noting that the licensing structure will transition back half of the year versus front half of the year. And obviously, we had a heavier launch slate last year in the back half of the year. So we can work through that with you all in the call downs, but just note there's definitely ebbs and flows in timing, and particularly point that to Q2, in particular, as you look at the EPS we put out and how that resonates year-on-year. Katie Burke : Operator, we're ready for the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Benjamin Soff : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You guys referenced that your margins today are reflective of some investments in long-term projects. And I'm just wondering if you guys could help us a little bit better understand the impact there and maybe what margins might look like in more of a steady state? And then secondly, would you anticipate any changes in consumer spending if student debt payments were to resume at scale? Thanks. Stuart Canfield : Ben, I'll tackle the second -- maybe the first one. I think, obviously, we're not going to create any guidance or direction on margin structure on a steady state go-forward. I think I'd just point you to the fact that, obviously, we've had depressed margins. We've continued to invest and expensed as we go. We do expect to get back to levels prior to a couple of years ago as we step that margin through. As you think about as we bring some of those titles to bear in the future, both from an owned IP perspective and some of the scale of Battlefield and we think about the business models that will come with other titles around Sims and skate, you should expect that to flow down and be accretive from a margin level as we step through in the future years. Andrew Wilson : As I don't know that I can comment specifically on student debt or what might happen there. What I would say is this, though. Entertainment is a fundamental human need, and it has been since the beginning of time. As we look at the emerging generations of consumers, including students, they're choosing interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment. There's a couple of reasons for that. One, it is way more engaging than maybe what traditional entertainment was. Two, it helps you connect with friends and stay connected with friends. So the nature of the relationships that you build through your consumption of these entertainment properties is significantly more rewarding on a personal basis than watching a movie ever was. And I love movies. But three, the most important thing is it represents the best value entertainment. Even as you think about our incredible scale and the incredible financial performance and growth that we have ahead of us, at an individual consumer level, it still represents the best value entertainment on the planet on a per-hour basis of entertainment. And so I'm not sure what will happen with student debt. But my sense is as we continue to see our industry grow and we continue to see our company grow, as we continue to scale the nature of experiences that we deliver to our consumers and the level of entertainment and connection that provides them, that regardless of what happens in that area, we will continue to be their first choice for entertainment. Benjamin Soff : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Katie Burke : Thank you. And operator, we'll take our last question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Last quarter, it was noted that players were concentrating their spend on major franchises. Just wanted to see first if there was any update to that? And then Andrew, in your commentary, you highlighted a goal for Apex as an experience across platforms. I'm assuming that includes mobile as well. So can you speak to how you envision, potentially relaunching that title on phones and how the approach could differ to the prior game? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes. So let me touch on the first part. I do think we continue to see big titles getting bigger and live services getting bigger. And certainly, as a company with a broad portfolio of large-scale IP and large-scale live services, we believe that we will be long-term beneficiaries of that trend. We do -- that doesn't mean that we won't build smaller titles over the course of time. There are these incredible stories that we believe should be told in the context of entertainment. We are focusing our investments so that we can build a cost base around those that's appropriate, but we're also really getting behind our biggest opportunities. And as we've talked about our strategy and building these experiences that entertain massive online communities, our expectation is that will be a large-scale growth driver for us. But, when thought about the right way, games like Dragon Age and Jedi can tell truly blockbuster stories and really break into that top category of games. I think what we see today is the mid-tier and lower games that maybe did pretty well through COVID, because people had a lot of spare time, they're the parts of the industry that really aren't doing and performing as well. And as we think about our future, you should expect we will continue to focus our investments and our energy and our resources against these big opportunities because we do believe that is where the industry is trending. Laura Miele : Hi, David, I'll take the Apex mobile question. As Vince and the team evaluate and look at, again, the runway and potential that we have on the franchise beyond the short mid-term that I've outlined today, we see really strong potential in further storytelling, in additional modalities in genre of play. Remember, Apex is set in the Titanfall world. There's a lot of demand and interest in this universe. So as we -- as they evaluate and we look at where the opportunities are, we are looking at new genres, we're looking at potential new platforms, and we are looking at, as I mentioned earlier, the geographic expansion. So nothing to announce today, but all things are not only under consideration, but a meaningful part of our strategy for the future of the brand. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Thank you very much for being with us today, and thank you for all of your questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a record Q1. We look forward to updating you next quarter on November 1 after what I think is going to be our biggest EA Sports season ever, including Madden 24 and of course, our highly anticipated launch of EA SPORTS FC 24. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

It\u2019s great to be here with all of you. It was a strong Q2 for EA as we delivered results above our expectations. We are making great progress against our strategy to build massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of social connection to drive multi-year growth and unlock long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. All our teams through passion and creativity continue to deliver interactive entertainment and experiences that engage and inspire hundreds of millions of people as part of our communities inside our global network. To everyone at EA, thank you. During the quarter, EA SPORTS continued to expand its position as a leader of the future of sports fandom as we launched two of the world\u2019s most celebrated interactive experiences at the heart of sports culture, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. These titles represent foundational drivers of growth in the biggest sports year in our company\u2019s history. In Madden NFL, we have delivered the preeminent interactive American Football experience for decades. We know it\u2019s essential for today\u2019s fan as NFL broadcasts grow in popularity and reach to connect with their friends and celebrate their passion for the sport, beyond what happens on the field, each and every day. Through our Madden NFL franchise, we make this possible in ways no one else can, through awesome gameplay, deep social connection and a 365-day immersion in the sport for so many people, with so many different motivations and expressions of their fandom. On console and PC, Madden NFL 24 delivered an immersive experience with elevated realism, control, and gameplay. This has energized our core franchise players, while modes like Superstar are bringing new players to this already giant community. Madden NFL 24 is off to a strong start, with almost 10% more players in the title year-over-year and driving over 10% growth in weekly average users. During the quarter, Madden mobile had more players diving into the game year-over-year, growing the community over 20%, and delivering double-digit growth in weekly active users. As we continued to expand our American football ecosystem, our teams also ushered in a new era for global football at the end of the quarter. The successful launch of EA SPORTS FC represents a profound achievement. We have reimagined and expanded one of the largest franchises in the world, setting new standards of authenticity, innovation, and social interaction. This cutting-edge, multi-experience ecosystem spans console, PC, mobile, and free to play, with a ground-breaking game in FC 24; advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia; and a new global esports program in FC Pro. Fans, across geographies and generations, are playing, connecting and celebrating in and around these incredible, immersive experiences. Coming off a record-setting FIFA 23 performance amidst two World Cups, FC is set to deliver growth this year and beyond. Fan reception of FC has been extraordinary, expanding our already thriving global football community. Within the first four weeks after world-wide launch, over 14.5 million fans have played FC 24 on console and premium PC, including double-digit growth in new players. FC Mobile has established new franchise records, with over 2 million people installing the game on the first day, over 5 million in the first three days, and over 11 million in the first 10 days. FC Online continues to grow across all engagement metrics, while players have truly embraced FC Pro with a record number of registrations. FC represents a giant leap forward as we aspire to more deeply connect and grow the world\u2019s largest football community to a billion fans and beyond. The successful launch of FC shows our portfolio strategy at work. We are now able to accelerate creativity and innovation across platforms, geographies, and business models; expand our football experiences across play, watch, create, and connect; and inspire and entertain even more fans around the world. We are in an extraordinary position to further collaborate with more amazing partners to grow FC as a cultural phenomenon. FC is more than just a game, and this is just the beginning. Halfway through the year, our sports teams, the very best in the business have delivered an unprecedented slate of amazing content. This story continues into Q3, as EA SPORTS NHL 24 and EA SPORTS UFC 5 have already launched to critical acclaim. The EA SPORTS WRC launch is also just two days away. Looking ahead, exciting updates tied to the biggest moments of the sports season will fuel momentum across our titles through the rest of the fiscal year and beyond, as we build out our multi-platform ecosystems with FC Tactical releasing in 2024 and EA SPORTS College Football coming next summer. As we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest IP, we are prioritizing the massive online communities of our always-on live services to lay a broad foundation for future launches and strong growth for the business. Through the expanding worlds, characters, and storylines that we deliver, people everywhere come together to celebrate their love of games, cherish community, and forge lifelong friendships. Apex Legends is a leader in its category with top game quality and gripping content. In Q2, Season 18 entertained and energized players, driving improvement in monetization over the prior season. We recognize the franchise exists in a competitive environment and, looking forward, our team at Respawn is focused on doing even more incredible things for players, engaging the community and deepening the franchise in exciting ways to drive growth starting with yesterday\u2019s launch of Season 19, featuring dynamic game updates and content integration with music industry icon Post Malone. The Sims 4 community is celebrating creativity and culture and growing across generations. Maxis is using data insights and deep connections with the community to create fan favorite content. New players, as well as weekly average users, are up double digits year-over-year. The team is committed to entertaining and inspiring our Sims 4 community with an increasing amount of new content as they work on a parallel, expansive experience in the Sims universe. Just last month, we launched Season 6 for Battlefield 2042, and our community is responding positively, driving record engagement on Steam. This illustrates the strength today and long-term potential of the franchise. Through innovation and creativity, our teams continue to support this huge community of fans, while building towards the future of Battlefield. Live services are the foundation of our business. Through the first half of the year, we have delivered an impressive amount of content across new games and over 285 game updates. As our teams create even more incredible entertainment, players will find more joy, more inspiration, and deeper connection, powering engagement and expanding our communities. Across geographies and business models, we are driving growth today and over the long-term. While being mindful of current events and varying global macro consumer outlooks, our seasoned teams of leaders and world class teams are focused on doing what they do best, delivering amazing games and services for players everywhere. As we continue to invest in our vision to lead the future of entertainment, we remain thoughtful and deliberate, focusing on our largest opportunities. Over the next few years, our teams will innovate and expand our biggest IP, as we build platforms and ecosystems to connect massive online communities that celebrate fandom across the world; inspire and engage our players through blockbuster storytelling; and continue to create experiences that amplify our communities through social connection. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Stuart Canfield : Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. Our strong Q2 performance delivered results exceeding our expectations across net bookings and EPS. We saw growth in our player network, with healthy engagement driving strength in our EA SPORTS portfolio, highlighted by the successful launches of EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. For the second quarter, net bookings were $1.82 billion, up 4% year-over-year, or 5% in constant currency, which exceeded our expectations for both full game and live services. Our full game net bookings were $691 million, up 9% year-over-year, or up 10% in constant currency, driven by strength in our Q2 EA SPORTS releases. Live services net bookings were $1.13 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency. On a trailing twelve-month basis, live services were 73% of our business, demonstrating the resiliency of our evergreen live services business model. EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 delivered a strong launch in the quarter, with net bookings up 6% year-over-year, as exciting new in-game innovations continued to drive growth across player acquisition and engagement. As Andrew noted, the momentous transition to EA SPORTS FC was a huge achievement for EA. In Q2, our total global football business significantly exceeded our expectations. Net bookings grew 41% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum of FIFA 23, including triple-digit mobile net bookings growth, and strong demand for the release of EA SPORTS FC 24. The launch had a tremendous start, highlighted by healthy retention of our core cohort, strong acquisition of new and reactivated players, greater demand for Deluxe editions of FC 24, and the benefit of four extra days of early access. In the first four weeks, FC Ultimate team was up high single digits on a year-on-year basis. Apex Legends, though down on a year-over-year basis, delivered net bookings above our expectations, with Season 18 driving greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization. Apex Legends remains one of the strongest franchises in the industry, and we will continue to invest to engage a broader base of players and drive long-term growth, as the talented teams at Respawn introduce innovations and new offerings, like in Season 19. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.91 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Operating expenses came in below our expectations, reflecting savings and the phasing of some marketing spend into the holiday period, as we continued to make progress against focusing and rationalizing our investments. On a year-over-year basis, OpEx was up 7%, primarily driven by the incremental investment behind the launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 37% year-over-year, including $0.34 from a one-time non-cash tax benefit. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $112 million, including benefit from lower cash taxes. On a trailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2 billion, up 28% year over year. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. To start, I\u2019d like to recap the context and assumptions behind our full-year net bookings guidance range, which remains unchanged. First, we expect healthy player engagement across our portfolio, even as we continue to operate amidst a highly competitive market and a varying macro-backdrop. Second, for EA SPORTS FC, we continue to expect low single-digit growth for the full-year even as we lap record FIFA 23 performance, which included the impact of World Cup events. Third, FX continues to remain volatile. If rates remain unchanged, we expect a two-point headwind to net bookings and six-point headwind to underlying profitability, net of hedges, relative to last year. And finally, we continue to be focused, deliberate, and disciplined on our investments as we execute against our long-term growth opportunities. Our full-year net bookings outlook remains unchanged at $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year, or up 1% to up 7% in constant currency. Our full-year GAAP net revenue outlook of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and our cost of revenue outlook of $1.67 to $1.75 billion also remain unchanged. As we continue to manage and prioritize investments across our portfolio, we are lowering our guidance for operating expenses to $4.21 billion to $4.33 billion, down 2% to up 1% year-over-year, which we also expect to help drive improvements in our underlying profitability. We are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance to $4.10 to $4.66, up 42% to 62% year-over-year, reflecting operational savings and the one-time tax benefit noted earlier. We are raising our guidance range for operating cash flow by $250 million to $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. We are lowering our capital expenditures outlook to $250 million, driven by deliberate decisions to optimize our real estate footprint. And we now expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion, up 27% to 38% on a year-over-year basis. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect net bookings to be $2.25 billion to $2.45 billion, down 4% to up 5% year-over-year, or down 2% to up 6% at constant currency. For EA SPORTS FC 24, we expect modest growth given the World Cup comparable noted earlier, and in Apex Legends, we continue to take a more measured approach as our teams introduce more new modes of play and content offerings. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.83 billion to $2.03 billion, cost of revenue of $495 million to $535 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.11 billion. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $1.01, up 3% percent to 38% year-over-year. In closing, EA delivered a strong Q2 performance, ahead of our expectations, driven by our EA SPORTS launches and strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of games and services. Looking forward, our teams are committed to delivering high-quality experiences for our players and building upon the momentum in our business, especially as we head into the holiday period. We continue to make progress in aligning around our strategic opportunities; we remain proactive and focused and disciplined in our investments to deliver multiyear growth. Now, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Stuart. Our industry is growing as more people around the world dive into the sports, brands, storytelling, and legendary IP they love most. The definition of a game is also expanding beyond play as fans are watching, creating content, and making deep social connections in and around interactive experiences. How games are being made is changing as well. Advancements in Generative AI are accelerating the speed of development, boosting creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver, bringing bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience. The value and opportunity of delivering deeply interactive entertainment has never been greater. Our talented teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and growing global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions. Katie Burke : Lisa, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Cost : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess on the launch of EA FC, I guess, what were the areas where you were most pleased with the launch versus last year and the areas where maybe you saw the room for the most improvement? And are you still on track to hit the low single-digit growth of the franchise year-on-year that you had spoken about at the beginning of the year? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Thanks for the question. I would tell you, we are almost universally happy with the launch. Taking on this launch was a big challenge for us, was a challenge for the nature of the game that our teams had to make across platforms, across console, PC, mobile and our free-to-play game that's mostly in Asia. We wanted this to be a symbol of change, not just a change of symbol. And I think the teams have done an extraordinary job in delivering the most authentic, immersive socially connected football experience ever, certainly that we've ever made. I think our marketing teams have done a tremendous job in ensuring that the world's population of football fans understands the transition has happened, understands the benefits of that transition and understands why this represents not the end, but the very beginning of what is going to be an incredible journey of football fandom for our fans and for our partners globally. I think that, if you really sat down with our developers or our marketers or our partners, there are always things we can do better, and we're always learning, but on balance, I would say, we feel very, very proud of what we've achieved so far. It's only early, but certainly, all the signs are incredibly positive, and the feedback is also incredibly positive. And we feel good about where we think the franchise is going from a performance standpoint. Stuart, do you have some more? Stuart Canfield : Yes, Matt, I'll just add just to clarify. So yes, we remain on track for the low single-digit growth that we represented. I think two important pieces of context. Yes, we're off to a great start. To Andrew's point earlier, we obviously saw strength in Q2. And obviously, importantly, we're seeing \u2013 we're up high-single digits year-on-year through the first four weeks on our live service business. Caveat being, we remain prudent as we head into Q3 and Q4. As you remember from last year, we saw record Q4 across our business, up 31%, but we still feel confident and on track for low single-digit growth for the rest of the year. Matthew Cost : Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Benjamin Soff : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on FC again, really strong launch so far, so that's encouraging. I'm wondering if you anticipate that the pacing of sales for this game will be similar to prior years. Or if you'd expect any changes to that trend as a result of the rebrand, maybe either more front-end loaded because of some excitement or longer tail because it might take time for some of the marketing to reach people? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I think Stuart can kind of talk about how we're playing that. I think what we're doing right now is we're planning for both of those potential outcomes. We feel very good about the launch so far. We've certainly brought in a meaningful amount of net new fans and net new players in the ecosystem, which is always an incredible sign and prediction for the future. We also know we still have a meaningful amount of people playing the previous game. And as we're starting to see, and it's less about the FC transition and more about our live service business in general, as we think about live services, we're seeing the transition from one launch to the next, be a little bit more organic. And certainly, as we have supported the live services right up until the new launch. There's often very good reason for people to continue playing the previous game. And so I do believe that we brought in new fans through an incredible game experience and incredible marketing, but we also recognize that we still have a meaningful population playing the previous game, and we're now working very deliberately and diligently to bring those over to FC and continue to grow the base of FC on a go-forward basis. Stuart Canfield : Yes, Ben, just on phasing, I think you've seen a great start. So naturally you've seen us pull forward a little bit through Q2 in the first three weeks, which is natural and part of the strategy as we launched FC. We expect Q3 to operate broadly in a similar manner as we progress through both season and the real world and heading into holiday. We expect Q4 will be more of a tougher comp in part because we had the World Cup pickup from players that flow through into Q4. So macro, yes, stronger start, consistent through Q3 and more of a flat consistency around Q4 given the comp on the prior year. Benjamin Soff : Got it. And then on Apex, can you just talk a little bit more about what resonated with players for Season 18 and some of the drivers you see to generate growth for this franchise over the long-term? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. The team continues to develop incredible content. They're very deeply connected with their fan community. And what we've started to see is different types of content, more dynamic content more content that has application across legends versus being legend specific and different chase mechanics inside the game. Again, there's a deeply committed community, a deeply engaged community and when they come in and see these chase mechanics, it really drives ongoing engagement. And so my expectation is the team will continue to test and learn and continue to innovate and evolve the experience in line with community needs and community demands and community expectations. But what we've seen so far is very positive results to the more dynamic nature of the events and the offers that they've been pushing into the experience. Katie Burke : Thank you. Our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Eric Handler : Andrew, now that you're not shackled with some of the FIFA restrictions that you have on EA FC. I wonder if you could give a little perspective on what the impact was on revenue for sponsorship and advertising or maybe the impact from promotions? Andrew Wilson : Well, it's still really early as we think about the future of this franchise. We are just getting started. But as we talked before, our orientation by transitioning to FC was really about how do we work with more partners around the world in a way they want to work with us. And that's both leagues, teams, players, competitions and commercial partners. It was really about how do we expand the modalities of play inside the game to do new and interesting things for a growing fan base, how to expand engagement opportunities outside the game? How do we really develop FC as a football fan platform, not just an interactive gaming experience and how do we move really, really quickly. We think that with the partner structure that we have now and the many partners that we have around us with the deep connection we have with the community and the investments that we've been making in and around development across the entire ecosystem console, PC, mobile, free-to-play and beyond the bounds of the game is that these things will start to manifest over the coming months, over the coming seasons and over the coming years. Eric Handler : That's great. And then just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the real estate strategies that you're sort of working through right now? Stuart Canfield : Eric, I'll chime in here a little bit. We signed this out, and we talked about the restructuring heading out of our Q4 last year. And we continue just to sort of optimize both how we build going forward in both our current footprint today. So ongoing exercise for us, we continue to look at that as we work through the future of work. Eric Handler : Great. Thank you so much. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. David Karnovsky : Hi. Thank you. Maybe just one for Stuart. On the operating cash flow outlook, you're taking it up, I think, $250 million on a relatively unchanged operating income outlook. Can you just walk through the puts and takes of that? Are there one-off benefits or should we look at this as an underlying improvement in your conversion? Thanks. Stuart Canfield : Yes. Thanks, Dave, for the question. In short, yes, we've got a couple of one-off benefits we talked out in the script before. So we have obviously naturally have improved operating foundations and flow of cash benefit from interest we're seeing by virtue of the record cash flow we talked to in our narrative. And then secondly, yes, we're obviously seeing some onetime tax benefits that are flowing through giving us that lift you're talking about, which is $250 million. In addition, we're also obviously changing free cash flow as well to the question before from Eric as we pulled down some of our capital future strategy on investment to increase that up as well. So yes, onetime benefits tied around tax and obviously, some operating benefits picked up by having greater cash at hand that's driving greater interest for us. David Karnovsky : Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. When you think about FC seasonality of spend, has that dynamic shifted any when you look at annual cohorts. We just asked because FIFA engagement was surprisingly robust all the way up to FC launch and with these new FC play modalities, Pro, tactical mobile online, how do you see that impacting spend seasonality, maybe similar along with play styles, all these levers should just broaden out that engagement and spend as well, right? Andrew Wilson : Yes. I mean that is our assumption. I mean, this is the biggest sport in the world, and it's growing exponentially. It's growing meaningfully in this country as well, but also globally, it continues to grow. And as we think about the football fan community kind of growing into being of gaming age, we see an opportunity to serve them across a bunch of different vectors. And so as we think about the value of FC as a platform, it really comes down to three things. One is how many people are in the network and playing, how much time are they playing in the context of that engagement and how deep are the connections they have with those that they play with? And as you look at our strategy as we roll that out across platforms, across modalities, across geographies and across business models, everything we are doing, we are looking to pull on those levers that bring more fans into the community and give them more opportunities to engage deeply with the experiences that we create and connect more meaningfully with the friends that they enjoy those experiences with and what that has meant is just an overall expansion of the opportunity, both in terms of how many people are in the community broadly and the overall seasonality of spend has been elongated throughout the year. And so we're seeing far more consistent spend throughout the year because it's not just about the connection to a season of football. It's about a deep connection to the friends they share the love of that season of football with, and that love is 365 days a year. And so as we think about building this out both in the context of FC in the context of American football, in the context of our broader EA SPORTS portfolio and in the context of our other Giant IP, Apex, The Sims, Battlefield, you should expect that we will look to replicate this across the portfolio as we invest deeply in these opportunities to bring global communities of gamers together and give them opportunity to engage more deeply in the experiences they love and connect more meaningfully with their friends that they enjoy the experiences with. Brian Fitzgerald : Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, next question please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Maybe two questions, if I can. First, we continue to have a debate with investors about the recession resilience versus of gaming overall as an industry. I was curious what you're seeing in terms of spending habits on the consumer side of the equation across your portfolio of IP and what it tells you in terms of resilience versus resistance to potential in consumer volatility from a spending side when you think about the interactive entertainment landscape, number one. And then number two, it\u2019s really interesting to see the new user growth around the Madden franchise, where there's been sort of a geographic component to that IP over time because of the sport itself. How do you think about building more audience scale and size in Madden over the long-term? What were some of the key learnings from this year, the job to take into future years? Thanks so much. Andrew Wilson : Well, Eric, two great questions. I will try and cover them as best as I can and Stuart, please add details as we go. I think that when we think about recessionary predictions and the industry broadly, typically as an industry we have. I don't want to say, be recession-proof, but we have been more resilient than many industries have been and that's really because of two key things. One entertainment is a fundamental human need. It's very important to us as a species. And two, the form of entertainment that we offer to our communities represents incredible value even where there is constrained spending. As we look at the market today and we look across our portfolio, I think it probably is pretty consistent with what we see across the industry, which is the big games where there is deep engagement and deep social connection continue to benefit across our portfolio. And we are \u2013 but we do see different kind of spend patterns on a geo basis. There are some markets that are showing a little more softness than others relative to some of the growth that we're seeing across the world. We've heard others speak to some of the softness in market in Europe. We've certainly seen some of that across our portfolio. But in aggregate, on a global basis, we're seeing growth. As we think about Madden broadly, again, I just \u2013 I think we have been partners with the NFL for the best part of 30 years. Our teams work very, very closely with the NFL and the NFL Players Association and more importantly, NFL fans, football fans in this country and beyond the boundaries of this country. And the NFL is growing globally, and we see the NFL doing an incredible job of growing the sport and what our teams have been doing is building out again, thinking about these game experiences not just as one-off onetime experiences, but mechanisms to fulfill many motivations of sports fans and football fans. And those might be core gaming moments. Those might be more play trade moments, there might be more casual moments, there might be more arcade-like moments or there might just be moments to connect with other fans of the community. And what you're seeing from our teams right now is a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs and motivations what is a growing fan community for American football in this country and beyond. And I expect that we'll continue to work with the NFL and the NFL Players Association, our partners and the community broadly to continue to grow the business. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Katie Burke : Thank you. That ends our call. Andrew, do you have a few closing words? Andrew Wilson : Thank you all for being with us and for the great questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a really strong Q2. We look forward to updating you next quarter on January 30. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

It was a strong Q3, as we continue to entertain hundreds of millions of players and fans around the world. Our exceptional teams created high-quality games and experiences across our broad portfolio that, drove deep engagement and record live services. This quarter, two of the world's most celebrated interactive entertainment experiences EA SPORTS FC and EA SPORTS Madden NFL delivered phenomenal strength, as sizable drivers of long-term growth. We are launching amazing games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, create blockbuster interactive storytelling, and harness the power of community in and around our games. EA's Q3 results are a great example of our execution across our strategy. The FC platform is thriving at the center of the action, fandom, and culture of the world's game. The launch of EA SPORTS FC 24 has been a great success and has, once again, outperformed our expectations. Players are connecting, competing, and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-experience ecosystem. In Q3, players dove into Ultimate Team, driving double-digit net bookings growth and delivering the franchise's biggest net bookings week ever. FC Mobile also generated deep engagement with daily active users up by 29% year-over-year, while FC Online grew new players by 20% year-over-year. In calendar 2023, Madden NFL was the best-selling sports game in North America and continues to grow. Madden NFL 24, is engaging more players year-over-year through new, innovative gameplay features and compelling live services. In Q3, net bookings grew and engagement with Ultimate Team increased 19%. Madden Mobile also saw an increase in players during the quarter, generating double-digit growth across the community. Our business is gaining momentum as our communities continue to grow and the definition of play rapidly expands, to include watching gameplay, creating user generated content, and connecting with friends and families in and around beloved IP. There are billions of players around the world and this number, is expected to increase as younger generations choose gaming as their number one form of entertainment, generating incredible opportunities, for us to engage and deliver new experiences. The evolving worlds, unfolding stories, and rich characters of our live services are deepening players' relationship with our IP and broadening the global appeal of our portfolio. To further entertain our communities, we are building more ways for them to play, watch, create, and connect to generate growth and longevity in our biggest franchises. The Sims franchise, is the definitive life for simulation experience, offering its multi-generational community incredible ways to connect, create, and express their individuality. During calendar 2023, players have spent an astounding 1.8 billion hours in the Sims 4, a nearly 30% increase from the prior year. We remain committed to the global growth and innovation of this franchise. We're focused on delivering what the community wants most, from ongoing, new content and game modes for the Sims 4, to the social innovation, expansion, and connection in our future Sims release. Millions of passionate fans continue to come together through the nonstop action of Battlefield. The Battlefield 2042 community continues to grow, with total players up 17% year-over-year, and Season 6 live services driving strong engagement with weekly average users up 37% year-over-year. Our team is working hard to deliver for the community with increasingly engaging live services, like the recent announcement of Season 7 with new maps, weekly missions, and much more. In addition, we are making investments in the future of the franchise. Our exceptional teams from multiple world class studios, working with cutting-edge Frostbite technology, are building an expansive, community-focused Battlefield universe for fans all over the world. As a category leader with millions of loyal fans, we are looking forward to celebrating the fifth anniversary of Apex Legends. Over the past few months, we have listened closely to our community, and have deployed new features, new styles of play, and new content. We have also implemented tools, to better understand day-to-day game performance. In Q3, our new modes drove improved engagement, and the early impact of our new content in the current quarter is promising. To generate future growth, we are focused on entertaining core players and engaging new players, by investing in geographic expansion, innovating in the game economy, and making it easier than ever, for players to jump into our gameplay. Turning to FY '25, we will deliver even more excitement and entertainment through an expanded portfolio of connected ecosystems. Industry-leader EA SPORTS will launch a strong core slate of titles and always-on live services, to grow our sports business as a global community and drive value, year-after-year. Our journey building FC, the world's largest interactive platform for global football fans will continue with accelerated gameplay innovation, more social connection, and new brand collaborations to deliver even more value for players. Our teams, working with an incredible roster of partners, are just getting started with FC. We are well positioned to grow this platform as a cultural phenomenon. The momentum in Madden NFL will continue with events and experiences, tied to the biggest moments in the sport, alongside deeper investments in this ecosystem, including leaps in gameplay and deeper fan immersion. In addition to the meaningful advancements in Madden, we are bringing back fan favorite EA SPORTS College Football for the first time in over a decade. Looking further ahead, as more people spend more time playing and connecting in and around our titles, we see incredible potential for growth. Within our online communities, we are expanding blockbuster storytelling through deep, rich characters and new story modes to deliver bigger, broader games and live services. Connected experiences offer new, cutting-edge ways to engage and inspire players, and can unlock future innovative growth opportunities. Over the coming years, we expect accelerated growth in our business. Our long-term outlook coupled with secular tailwinds, drives further conviction in our strategy. By aligning our priorities and investments with our greatest opportunities, we can make the biggest impact and drive long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Stuart Canfield : Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter, we delivered net bookings of $2.37 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency, and in line with our expectations. Strength in our live services business, particularly EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team, was partially offset by some softness in the full game. Live services net bookings grew to a record $1.71 billion in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, or up 5% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations, as we continue to drive healthy engagement and bring new players to our franchises. Full game net bookings of $654 million was down 5% year-over-year, or down 4% in constant currency, versus a high prior year comparable that included the World Cup event. On a trailing 12-month basis, total net bookings was up 8% year-over-year, with live services contributing $5.6 billion, or 73% demonstrating the resilience of this evergreen business model. Building on the strong momentum from our launch at the end of Q2, EA SPORTS FC again exceeded expectations, as EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile delivered exceptional double-digit net bookings growth, against a World Cup comparable in the prior year. Our global football business net bookings grew 7% year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive strong retention of our core player base, through the FC brand transition. EA SPORTS Madden NFL, also saw another strong quarter, with net bookings up 5% year-over-year, highlighted by strong engagement trends across full game, Ultimate Team, and mobile. Additional highlights from the third quarter included new releases of EA SPORTS UFC, NHL, and World Rally Championship, which contributed to further expanding the aggregate fandom and strength of our EA SPORTS community, creating additional value-added services in one of the largest sports brands and platforms in the world. In a highly competitive quarter, Apex Legends did not meet our expectations, as our teams continue to learn and iterate with each new season and event. In the past few weeks, our recent cross-over promotion showed early promising signals, delivering two of our highest net bookings days over the fiscal year. With Season 20 launching in February, our teams will deliver more innovation as we continue to build for the long-term. We remain committed to Apex Legends, a proven franchise with loyal fans, and we will continue to invest in opportunities to drive new growth points as we build and expand the franchise over time through engaging a broader base of players. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.95 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, operating expenses were favorable to our expectations, also benefiting from some phasing of spend to Q4. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were up 3%, driven primarily by incremental marketing spend as we invested to support our titles and the EA SPORTS FC transition through the critical holiday season. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, up 47% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 13% year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2.16 billion. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. We are entering the final quarter of FY '24 well positioned to deliver on our commitments for the fiscal year. With our strong business performance year-to-date, our unrivaled portfolio of IP, and our consistent execution in our core live services business. Even in an incredibly competitive market, we are poised to deliver growth in net bookings consistent with what we outlined at the beginning of the year. At the same time, we are tracking to deliver higher levels of underlying profitability and record free cash flow. We remain deliberate and focused around the prioritization and allocation of resources across our teams and portfolio as we make progress against our long-term strategy to drive durable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder returns. Turning to our Q4 outlook, I\u2019d like to start by sharing a few key considerations. First, as a reminder, our Q4 net bookings, is impacted by timing, including releases of our full game and content offerings in the prior year. Second, we expect moderated growth in our EA SPORTS FC franchise as we lap record prior year performance. For the full year, we now expect EA SPORTS FC net bookings, to grow mid-to-high single digits, excluding FX. Third, we continue to take a measured approach to Apex Legends in its largest quarter of the year, as we introduce new modes of play and content offerings. And finally, we expect impact from FX to be minimal, as the benefit from more favorable currency exchange rates, is offset by hedging gains from the prior year. As a result, we expect net bookings of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion, down 16% to down 1% year-over-year, including approximately eight points of impact from the timing noted earlier. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion and cost of revenue of $360 million to $410 million. We expect operating expenses of $1.125 billion to $1.205 billion, including a $70 million impairment charge of certain acquisition-related intangible assets. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.68 for the fourth quarter. Before handing back to Andrew, I'd like to take a moment to share some early perspective on our multiyear growth objectives. EA is in an advantaged position to lead the future of interactive entertainment, with ongoing secular tailwinds and structural shifts within the industry, further amplifying our strategy. Our long-term financial framework is founded upon creating value for our shareholders by accelerating growth, delivering forward operating leverage, and increasing cash flow. In executing on our strategy, we expect to scale operating leverage through the following growth levers : 1) expanded player acquisition, engagement, and retention 2) highly accretive digital and live services 3) blockbuster new releases from our development pipeline, alongside compounding growth across our core franchises, and 4) discipline and focus on aligning our cost structure to invest in support of our strategic growth opportunities. As we look ahead to FY '25, and more specific guidance in our upcoming Q4 earnings call, I wanted to share some initial considerations. Assuming minimal impact to our results from FX, we expect low-single-digit net bookings growth, reflecting continued execution in our core businesses in a lighter release slate year. And excluding any impact from future share repurchases, we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in underlying profitability. Looking beyond FY '25, over the next couple of years, we expect our net bookings growth to accelerate, bolstered by our portfolio of industry-leading IP. Compounding growth within our core Sports franchises, new content and engaging experiences across our massive online communities, and iconic new releases like Battlefield, Sims, and other in-development titles, provide the inflection point that fuels net bookings growth and increases underlying profitability. And we expect to continue to deliver meaningful operating leverage and drive increased cash flow conversion, even as we continue to invest, to support our strategic objectives. In summary, with our incredible talent, industry-leading IP and technology, global and growing communities of fans, and our focus and discipline around our strategic objectives, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth commitments and drive value for our players and for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more over the coming quarters. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Stuart. I am inspired by the opportunities ahead, as we continue to execute our long-term strategy. Our mission to inspire the world to play is evolving and expanding beyond the traditional bounds of play. Technological advancements are powering creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver. We are positioned to bring bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience in the coming years. Our awesome teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions. Katie Burke : Thank you. Brianna, we're ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andrew Uerkwitz : Thanks for taking my questions. One tactical, one long-term. On the tactical one, it looks like the fourth quarter and full year guidance ranges, are pretty wide relative, to what you normally do. Just curious, one, if that's correct, and two, why is that when it seems like a lot of live services is outperforming? Stuart Canfield : Andrew, this is Stuart. I'll take that. Yes, first of all, the range, as we look forward, we'll continue to be broader, in this case, in the quarter, in part for two reasons. One, it's a more dynamic quarter for us, as you referenced, on our core live services. And the range is that, it reflects the both strength and opportunity we see. So, we're slapping a record World Cup comp for FC, and also is a fiscal high quarter for Apex. The second part, I'd also flag is that, as a reminder on the prepared remarks, is that we have eight points of headwind as well from timing of content released in the prior year. So, hence, the spread between the top and the bottom, is based around the biggest dynamic services we have in the quarter, particularly FC and Apex. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then, I appreciate you giving the color on the forward years. On the operating leverage, could you just maybe, walk us through a little bit, or give us additional color on the primary drivers there? Is that more live services from games, like Sims or Escape eventually? Or is that just naturally operating leverage from the fact you guys don't capitalize costs? Just kind of help us out, understand that dynamic a little bit better. I appreciate it? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes, let me start with this. Let's take a look at sort of the business over the longer term. We're laying out that overarching framework. It's kind of grounded in three pieces, accelerating growth on the top line, expanding leverage on the bottom and increasing cash flow. We're looking at that through a couple of different lenses. So one is, we do expect to continue to drive compounding growth across our core franchises. Plus, we expect to release from our pipeline that's been in development. And both of those will be bolstered, by expanded player acquisition, engagement and retention. As you know, our live services make up almost three quarters of our business, which highlights the evergreen nature of that business model and thus the ability to drive compounded growth, on those franchises through the future. New releases are the second part and they're an important lever for us, on that multi-year growth journey. And we're really flagging, through the long-term journey. They'll create some non-linearity in that growth, in terms of how we accelerate through the later years, depending on timing around that pipeline. Additional context would be that as we continue to drive through live service, and we see greater digital, we get far more accretion through that mix. We're also continuing to be really focused around getting leverage and scale out of OpEx in terms of our cost structure to drive growth. So, we think about those four pieces, core compounding growth across our current core business and live services, a more digital nature around that drives accretion and scale. Add to that the new releases that come through the pipeline, and ongoing management of costs, to ensure that we're investing for the future will ultimately provide leverage over the long-term for us. Andrew Uerkwitz : Got it. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Katie Burke : Brianna, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Cost : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. One would just be on some recent changes we've seen on app store fees in Europe, for Apple specifically. I guess, any early learnings there, any reflection on the possibility that you could see outside to gross margins for your mobile game business, at least in Europe? Is that an option that you would be interested in? Since I know it's an opt-in thing for game publishers. That's point one, question one. Question two, just beyond college football, as we get a little bit closer to release, can you do anything to help scale the opportunity for everyone and sort of think through what is incremental versus, what might come from the existing Madden customer base? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Hi, Matt. So, I'll quickly touch on the Apple one first. Yes, we're also aware of the intentions to update the European app store tied to their fees. We're still actively reviewing all of those updates and sort of working to understand potential implications to our business and any changes that may flow through from a gross margin perspective. As we gain more insight, understanding, we'll be able to provide a more update sort of next quarter in terms of how that might map through for us and impact gross margin, but no updates, or reflection of that at this point. Stuart Canfield : And on college football, our expectation is it will be additive. As we think about Madden, Madden is performing incredibly well this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, the biggest game, the biggest sports game in calendar year 2023, we're seeing increased engagement in the game and increased monetization in Ultimate Team as part of that. The team is continuing to invest meaningfully into the modes of Madden and the expansion of Madden as a product and certainly as we look at the NFL broadly and the fan base continue to grow and the incredible season we're having this year, our expectation is that we will invest behind Madden and grow Madden, and that what college football represents as a game that's been 10 years in the waiting for our fans. Is that there's incredible amount of pent up demand and we expect that to be additive to the ecosystem. And over the broad course of time, the way our team thinks about this, is how do we really expand the football community in this country and internationally through a combination of both Madden and college that, we think will be both complementary in gameplay, but overall additive to the ecosystem. Matthew Cost : Great, thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from [Chris Schull] with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the press release that you're prioritizing investment in the largest opportunities for multi-year growth. I appreciate you're looking to drive growth across the portfolio, but which franchises in particular - do you see the most incremental opportunity, as you look out into fiscal '25 and beyond? And then we've also seen some new developments and announcements from your peers around subscription gaming. Can you just remind us how you're thinking, about the role of subscription gaming, to your business and what traction you're seeing with EA Play and how do you balance making content available on your platform versus third-parties? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes, great question. Thank you. First and foremost, I would go back to as a core entertainment company, it is always important that, we are developing and investing in new IP, to grow the future pipeline opportunity, that optionality that Stuart referred to earlier. And we have the strongest pipeline, I think we've had in many, many years as we go into those out years in terms of both our core IP and new IP. If we look at the trailing 12-months, both in terms of engagement and monetization, what we do see however, is that the biggest games are these games that really entertain and engage massive online communities. And these are existing franchises that either evolve on a month-by-month cadence, or evolve with annual releases plus live services. And so, as we think about the foundation of growth for our business, we think about FC. Again, this was the first year of FC branding. What we've spoken about in the past few quarters, is having that FC branding and partnering more closely with the core leagues in territory gives us more growth opportunities, than we believe we ever had before. It is building around Madden NFL and expanding the broader college football base, but it's also investing in the Sims and in Apex and in Battlefield. And ultimately some of those as we go down through the next coming years. And so, while we will continue to invest meaningfully behind new IP, and we will be thoughtful and focused on those investments, we see significant opportunity based on how communities are coming together in games, around our biggest franchises, FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield, Apex. And we will work meaningfully, to expand those over the coming years. Stuart Canfield : And then on subscription, remember we have been early in subscription as a company. We have EA Play as a subscription that exists across platforms. It is part of the Game Pass Ultimate service on Xbox Live as well. I think that we believe, as we look forward that subscription will be a meaningful part of our industry, over the course of time. It hasn't really translated in the same way that a linear television or movie subscription has or a music subscription, just because of the nature of engagement in our content relative to those other mediums. However, as we think about the future, we do believe there is an opportunity to fundamentally disrupt how households consume content broadly. As we look at leaders in a space like Netflix and them leaning into games, as we listen to the performance of Warner Brothers' games division and their conversation around how that might feed into their broader subscription over time. We think we are in an incredibly strong position to continue to lead on subscription, at least as it relates with interactive, because of both the depth and the breadth of our portfolio, which as we look at our portfolio, we believe it is unrivaled in the industry, and spans across many genres, including sport, which of course is a meaningful driver of entertainment value in the coming years. Unidentified Analyst : That's very helpful. Thank you. Katie Burke : Thank you, Chris. Briana, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Eric Handler : Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Andrew, I wonder, if you have you ever thought about taking all of your essentially siloed sport communities and thinking about a way to bring them all together so that hockey fans, can talk to soccer fans, or football fans talk to UFC fans. And that way, you can build a huge community around that, where you could then layer in various highlight clips of real-world games and e-commerce, just sort of create, for lack of a better word, a metaverse, given how massive your community is? Andrew Wilson : Incredible question, and also very insightful. And certainly, as you think about our network, which is well over 700 million right now, about half of that interact with our sports games. And so, as we think about our sports community, it is almost certainly one of the largest collective sports communities on the planet. As we think about EA SPORTS as a brand, we know from brand research around the world. It's also one of the most recognizable and recognized sports brands. And as we think about emerging consumer generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for many of them, their first relationship with sports comes through their relationship with the leagues and teams and sports they love, as a result of their interaction with their EA SPORTS products. And so, what we know to be true is right now, as we think about our players. They spend on average about 90 minutes a session inside of one of our games. They then leave that game experience, where they've been deeply connected with their core friend unit, and they go and they talk about that experience on another platform. And then they go and create content about, that experience on yet another platform, and then finally, they go and watch that content on another platform. We do believe, we have a meaningful opportunity over the coming years to actually harness the power of that community, both inside and outside of our games, which is really the third pillar of our core strategy, and will be led by our EA SPORTS brand. So again, a super insightful question, nothing to announce today, but you should imagine that we see the very same thing. We see an incredible opportunity by virtue of the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio, the breadth and depth of our sports relationships around the world, which I think are unmatched on a global basis, and certainly the size and magnitude of our sports gaming community, and the relationship they have with their favorite sports through us, but more importantly, the connections that they're making with their friends, as a result of the time they spend with us. We think there's a meaningful opportunity for us to expand on that, both inside the game, and we're seeing that already, in our core products like FC and Madden, but also outside the game. And some of the starting points of that, are some of the deals that we've done with our licensed partners that do allow us to bring highlights, and other non-gaming content into the ecosystem broadly. So, best I can say is watch this space. Eric Handler : Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, I wonder if you could just give a little bit of an update about sort of the state of the mobile industry, sort of what you're seeing. Did mobile bookings were up modestly in the quarter. Do you think you've reached stabilization and you can expand from here? What are you seeing in the market? Stuart Canfield : All right. I'll - give a quick position on the financial framing that you just talked to. So yes, sort of in Q3, we actually tracked up 5% at constant currency when you exclude lapping of Apex from the prior year. We did see improvement sequentially. We saw double-digit improvement between Q2 and Q3. Our overall mobile portfolio, as you talked to, you saw the strength that we called out in particular around FC within that mix. We saw double-digit growth year-on-year, as we even entered a World Cup comp. In terms of how we think about mobile, as we move forward. I think we've been very clear on the strategy that, we're focused on, which continues to lean into the success we've seen around FC and our broader ecosystems as both an entry point, and expansion for us in terms of players. We'll continue to lean and focus on those across our biggest opportunities through whether it's FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield and beyond. Second part is we continue to look for the biggest hits in IP and opportunities that can stand alone on mobile itself. Wrapped inside of an incredibly disciplined approach as we've focused on driving profitability across this platform to some of our more historic levels versus the past. So, those are three kind of profiles we expect. So yes, quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement, strength overall year-on-year with plus 5% and a diligent strategy and approach from us around our biggest opportunities on ecosystems, IP within the platform with mobile itself, and obviously disciplined P&L performance around the business. Eric Handler : Thank you very much. Katie Burke : Thank you, Eric. Operator, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with BMO Capital Market. Brian Pitz : Thanks for the question. Andrew, we've seen reports that sports leagues like the NFL and NBA considering ownership stakes in the likes of ESPN. Obviously, EA has one of the most valuable audiences in sports. Just curious, are there opportunities for EA to partner more closely with these leagues? And also from another dimension, I guess, how do you think about this opportunity as the NFL and other leagues embrace sports betting? Is there a real money gaming opportunity? I know the industry has looked at it in the past, but I think we're in a new place now going forward? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes, again, great questions. I think the relationship between the NFL and the NBA and the likes of ESPN, is super interesting to us. I would think about this on two vectors. One, we have incredible relationships with our sports leagues. Many of them we've had for over 30 years and they have evolved with us, and we have evolved with them. A big part of what we have done through the rebrand of FC, is actually gotten significantly closer to our European Football League partners. And much of what we've done as we have renewed and bolstered those relationships for the next decade, and beyond is really think about, how we can come together in service of fans more broadly, not just fans in the context of interactive gameplay. And part of what you're seeing here as we start to bring highlights into our games and really think about FC as a platform, is kind of testament to that evolution of the nature of our relationship. I do believe that we have the opportunity to do the same, with the NFL and the NBA and you should imagine that we're working very closely with all of our league partners, NHL, UFC, F1, and we see a tremendous opportunity to really think about, EA SPORTS as a platform for engagement, and how we might grow in service of our fans, with our league partners. I would also highlight we've had a relationship with ESPN for the best part of 30 years and have worked very closely with them and continue to work very closely with ESPN and the Walt Disney Company as we think about the future of entertainment broadly. And so, we feel very good about our position in this future. We feel very good about the connection we have with the fans. We feel very good about our opportunity to grow our business as a result of this evolved service opportunity we have with them. Brian Pitz : Thank you. Katie Burke : Operator, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Andrew Marok : Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig into a couple of things on the recent Apex event this last month with FINAL FANTASY. So commentary sounded really good in the prepared remarks, but with the dynamic that versus prior collection events, it was maybe less expensive for the first few items, but more expensive to complete. How did that affect payer dynamics and what are some of the key learnings coming out of that event for you guys? Andrew Wilson : I guess - at a macro level we're really, really happy with that event. It was very well received by the community and it actually performed incredibly well. And certainly as we were in what was a very, very competitive quarter, there were a couple of competitive titles that, actually did some really unique and interesting things in the quarter. And so, the performance of Apex with that collection event in the context of some of these other unique things happening in the competitive landscape. We think shows tremendous promise for how the franchise continues into Season 20 and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the team lately. The team are very committed to the game. They're very committed to the community. They're working diligently to offer new types of content and new types of mechanics into the game. And they've put tools in place to test those meaningfully to ensure that, both they're enhancing gameplay. But also that they're fulfilling the needs and motivations of the community. And I'm very encouraged by what we saw out of that collection event. And I'm very encouraged as we go into Season 20 and all the new and interesting things that the team's doing. Andrew Marok : Great. Thank you. You kind of led into what was going to be the next part of my question. So, we've seen Apex do some smaller crossover events in the past, but how did the FINAL FANTASY partnership specifically kind of come about? And with the increasing intent kind of in the rest of the states, as you hinted at for a lot of these cross media partnerships, how much room and intent, is there for more of these more substantial crossovers within Apex? Andrew Wilson : Yes, I think we're still learning and the team is now thinking through, what that might look like. Remember, Apex is this incredible game that has attracted hundreds of millions of people to play. That's tremendous retention in its core. And underneath that core gameplay, which is incredible and what Respawn is known for, is also tremendously deep lore about who these characters are, where these characters come from, and how those characters interact in the world. And so, we have to be very thoughtful about any brand crossovers that we do, to make sure that we're not impeding on the authenticity of the characters or the game in any way. What I think the Final Fantasy crossover did was actually open our eyes to the kinds of things that are possible, and the kind of things that will be super well received by our core fan base and new fans alike. And how that lines up with the core law of the game. And so I would expect that we have more opportunities to do this in the future. But I would also expect that the team will continue to protect both the core game play, the core character set and the core law in the world, what this event does show is we have probably more ability to do things in that direction than we may have thought previously. Katie Burke : Thank you. Operator, our last question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Michael Hickey : First question is kind of a challenge, Andrew, because it hasn't been announced that we obviously have a fair amount of evidence that the switch to, from Nintendo should come out this year. And from what we know, it's going to be a bigger display, more horsepower. It seems like it is something a platform that would better lend itself to your game. So in as much as you can sort of talk about an opportunity that's not beneficially announced. Just curious if you think you can have more success on that sort of platform that seems better geared towards your games? The second one is sort of, it looks like '25 is not calling an investment year, but most of the growth here is driven by your core games and Live Services. But you look at your longer-term pipeline, you think about Battlefield, Mass Effect, Star Wars, obviously, you've been great in the action genre. I think you're still developing a shooter from Respawn as well. [10 Street] to play maybe user-generated content, licensed properties like Ironman, Black Panther, I mean all of those seem feasible by fiscal '27. So just sort of curious, I know you kind of talked about your longer-term growth opportunity in near term, you focused on leverage, but do you think you're sort of in a position here in the next 2 years to sort of accelerate your top line growth just given how substantial your pipeline appears to be? Andrew Wilson : Yes. A lot there, and you're a little quiet at the beginning, but I think what you're asking or was suggesting there has been some rumors that Nintendo was doing a new console, and to the extent that I'm able to comment on things that are not yet announced, do I think that might benefit our company and our portfolio? Again, I can absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way. What I would say, though, is, to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution, to the extent those things have happened, where we're able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business. Our players' ability to really experience our games at the highest level has typically worked out very well for us. And so without commenting at all on anything around Nintendo or the Switch, I would just say. New platforms are good for us, where new platforms offer improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution that typically is a plus for our particular portfolio of games and the community that plays them. Stuart Canfield : Mike, just to kind of tackle your second question. Let's take '25 first, a second, and I'll build it back into the longer-term answer I gave before, and we prepared remarks on as well. So first on '25. So I think the key here is we expect growth in our core business. We're 73% Live Service and obviously have a consistent Full Game Sports release slate, plus we've talked to College coming in the summer next year in 2024. Second, we do have a lighter release slate, which obviously comps to a Star Wars launch and a more expansive sports like where we saw 8 titles released this year. And we've called out also that Battlefield is not in our FY '25 outlook, third, we continue to drive leverage. And I'll just point you to your question around sort of an investment year. You can see sort of by the underlying profitability range that we are still getting scale and leverage by virtue of efficiencies in the business. But also continue to resource and reallocate against some of our bigger growth opportunities. The last one, obviously is just a reminder, we continue to expense costs. So we continue to build into that acceleration that flows into the longer term beyond FY '25 that will be highly beneficial we think of operating leverage to some of the questions we've had earlier. So you kind of put that together. So FY '25, obviously a core business growth. We'll talk more about the details in our Q4 call, lighter slate ongoing scale and leverage from the core business itself and obviously, we expense as we go from an investment perspective. We do expect to see for all the titles in terms of new releases, plus ongoing growth in our core business that we do believe we continue to get accretion and long-term growth and incremental cash flow that accelerates through those following years to the comments we laid out earlier. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for your great questions, really good questions today. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering incredible interactive entertainment to our growing global communities. And to close, I'd say, we're confident in our ability to deliver value through our accelerated growth, forward operating leverage and increased cash flow over the longer term. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our fiscal year results on May 7. And before we sign off, it would be remiss of me if I didn't congratulate our local Bay Area team, the 49ers for making the Super Bowl hell of a game on Sunday, good luck against the Chiefs in Las Vegas, Go Niners. Operator : That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

In FY 2024, we entertained and connected hundreds of millions of people around the world. I'm inspired by how our teams continue to create and deliver more innovative content and deeper experiences than ever. Before I dive into our results, I want to talk about the accelerating transformations across the entertainment landscape and how we have been navigating and leading through change. Firstly, consumer retention and spend are increasingly consolidated in top franchises. As live services deliver fresh content, players are going deeper and spending more time with their friends in blockbuster experiences. For example, in North America, engagement for the top 10 franchises have increased their market share since fiscal 2022. For a company that has some of the biggest IP in the world, this trend presents an incredible opportunity to evolve as an industry leader. It is against this backdrop that we have built our three strategic pillars around entertaining and engaging massive online communities, telling blockbuster stories and harnessing the power of community in and around our games. Secondly, players and fans are increasingly looking to us to deliver the entertainment they want today and tomorrow, bigger, bolder, more connected experiences where they can play, watch, create and connect like never before. As players needs and motivations expand, we continue to sharpen our focus. Across this past fiscal year, we took proactive steps to further empower our creative leaders by realigning our investments, organization and portfolio in support of our largest growth opportunities. As we have demonstrated several times in the past by building some of the world's largest franchises, when we rally behind a shared goal, EA delivers more creativity, more connection and more cutting edge experiences for players and fans. The most recent example of this is the incredible launch of our multi-platform experience, EA SPORTS FC, which was a truly profound moment for our players, our teams and our partners. This milestone as well as our execution across this fiscal year demonstrates how EA is leading the future of entertainment. I'm excited to share more details about our development pipeline, innovative experiences and new revenue streams at our Investor Day this September in New York. Our teams at EA Sports are the best in the business, delivering awesome gameplay, innovation and unmatched authenticity to fire the passion and imagination of hundreds of millions of players and fans. FY 2024 was the biggest EA SPORTS year in our history, a year in which we launched eight titles across the year, including the highly successful launch of our own brand, EA SPORTS FC. Players are connecting, competing and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-platform experiences. In FY 2024, our global football franchise grew net bookings by high teens, a remarkable year considering the prior year benefited from significant tailwinds related to the World Cup. During calendar 2023, there were billions of matches played across FC experiences and the franchise's astounding success goes far beyond gameplay. Our massive global football community watch more than a billion hours of content in and around our game. Gameplay videos, pitch notes and e-sports in addition to content produced by our community. These many interactions on and off platform meaningfully increase in-game engagement, which drive stronger retention and ultimately greater levels of monetization. What we know when we look at play behavior in our games, as players spend more time with their friends, they play more, they play for longer, and this engagement leads to more in-game spend. With the successful launch of EA SPORTS FC, our focus was two-fold, delivering innovation in gameplay with HyperMotion V, new features and improvements across all modes of play for our core players, while continuing to expand the game's reach through the acquisition of new players and reengagement of lapsed players. Our go-forward strategy is anchored in building a platform that enables us to deepen our connection with players, lead the future of immersion by bringing the real world of sport and our experiences closer together and expanding the tools, modalities and partnerships to drive enhanced socialization, self-expression and creation for sports fans. We've engaged with partners like Nike, Pepsi, Uber Eats and Beats over the last year and we'll continue to do so, integrating them into matchday experiences and providing them with a platform to deeply connect with our global audience. We are also building to unlock new multifaceted sponsorship and advertising opportunities. FC is more than just a game, it's the world's leading digital football fan platform, and this is just the beginning. Year-after-year, Madden NFL unites fans and athletes through interactive experiences that fuel passion, connection and creativity. No one can match Madden's unparalleled authenticity in American football. Our talented teams pushed more innovation in the Madden NFL 24, more modalities of play and amazing content throughout the season, leading to the highest selling installment for Madden since the early 2000s and record overall net bookings. Further innovation in live service events has led to deep ongoing engagement well beyond the NFL season, especially with younger audiences as we've seen increases in weekly active users into and following the Super Bowl. Most recently, excitement has continued through the NFL draft as top picks were dropped into Ultimate Team in real time. We see this excitement leading us right into an incredible Madden NFL 25. To expand the American football experience, this summer we are launching the highly-anticipated EA SPORTS College Football 25, bringing new innovations, always on social connection and unrivaled immersion. This awesome experience will feature all 134 Football Bowl Subdivision schools, more than 11,000 college athletes, the iconic traditions and pageantry of the United States' biggest college sport and unparalleled gameplay to inspire the fandom of millions of fans. This is the next step in a multi-year plan to further evolve and grow our American football experiences into a connected ecosystem to more deeply engage and expand an already thriving community. We see incredible opportunities ahead for us across our sports business, as we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest communities, we are also prioritizing our owned IP in the rest of our broad portfolio, which are among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Since its surprise Smash Hit release in 2019, the HD title of Apex Legends has surpassed $3.4 billion in lifetime net bookings. In FY 2024, we focused on building features and improving quality of the experience to drive long-term engagement, positioning us for future revenue growth. For example, we finished the year with significant changes to the mechanics of our popular ranked mode. We engaged with the community, increased transparency and thoughtfully addressed their feedback, and as a result, saw dramatic improvements in player sentiment across the world improving 29 points. We have also prioritized expanding Apex's appeal, making it more approachable for new and more casual players with improved onboarding and simplified modes of play like 3 Strikes and Straight Shot. Looking to the future, we will continue to invest in broadening the audience by building upon the epic characters and storytelling of this world that go beyond the current Battle Royale. The passion for Sims Community remains strong as the franchise powers towards its 25th anniversary. Since its launch in 2014, the Sims 4 has surpassed 85 million players with FY 2024 up double-digits year-over-year. The Sims Online and the Sims Mobile combined have been downloaded over 500 million times. This is already one of the largest communities in the world and we believe this hugely successful franchise has the potential to become one of the largest creator platforms in entertainment. An early proof point of the platform's evolution is the hundreds of millions of user generated content items that were shared in this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we are committed to entertaining and inspiring our loyal and engaged Sims 4 fans through over 15 content updates over the coming year, while working on multiple experiences in the Sims universe to leverage user generated content to deepen our community and expand our audience. With each immersive action-packed season of Battlefield 2042, players have made it clear that they wanted an even deeper experience. Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons and are driving to the future. Motive, armed with cutting edge frostbite technology and compelling storytelling is joining dice, criterion and ripple effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history. A few weeks ago, I was visiting with the teams and I couldn't be more excited about what they showed and what we were able to play. Turning to mobile, we are heads down on bringing together mobile and HD franchise leadership for EA SPORTS FC, Madden NFL and the Sims, while also continuing to make strategic investments in standalone mobile titles. Mobile is the largest platform in our industry and with our teams aligned and more empowered than ever, we see growth opportunities in this part of our business over time. I will now turn it over to Stuart for more detail on FY 2024 with additional color on the near-term industry outlook and incremental detail and metrics around our confidence in FY 2026 and FY 2027. Stuart Canfield : Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andrew spoke to earlier, we've been on a journey to transform our business to meet the needs of an evolving industry landscape, which has seen players develop new engagement behaviors and demands. To meet these changing player needs, we've been deliberate over the last fiscal year to prioritize our investments, streamline our portfolio and align our teams and organization behind our biggest strategic opportunities. Overall, these changes set us up to deliver accelerated growth from the core business, while building the foundational blocks to expand and deepen both engagement and monetization into the emerging interactive entertainment categories of create, watch and connect. Turning first of fiscal year 2024, EA delivered strong earnings growth and record cash flow in a highly competitive market. Our results were highlighted by the hugely successful rebrand for the EA SPORTS FC and growth across our largest sports franchises with both global football and Madden franchises delivering record net bookings results. For the fiscal year, we delivered total net bookings of $7.43 billion, up 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Full game net bookings of $2.01 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency was driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi : Survivor and our EA SPORTS portfolio. We launched four new non-annual sports titles in FY 2024, strengthening our EA SPORTS brand as it further expands fandom across one of the largest platforms in the world. Live services net bookings was $5.43 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the sunset of Apex Mobile, live service net bookings was about flat year-over-year. Strength in live services was driven by high teens growth year-over-year in our global football franchise, fueled by FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile was offset by declines in Apex Legends. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $7.56 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $1.71 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower royalties and lower acquisition-related expenses, resulting in a gross margin of 77.4% for the year, an improvement of 150 basis points. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, GAAP operating expenses were $4.33 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven predominantly by incremental marketing spend to support our new releases and launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $4.68, which included $64 million of restructuring and related charges, significantly outpacing our original expectations, growing 63% year-over-year. Operating cash flow of $2.32 billion, a record for a fiscal year deliver considerable improvement and accelerated growth year-over-year. Capital expenditures for the year were $199 million, below our original $275 million guide as we further rationalized our real estate investment and footprint over the year. This resulted in a record year for free cash flow of $2.12 billion, up 58% year-over-year. This includes a one-time cash tax savings of approximately $150 million. Over the year, we returned $1.51 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Moving to fourth quarter results. Total net bookings for the fourth quarter was $1.67 billion, down 14% year-over-year in both actual and constant currency. Full game net bookings for the quarter was $259 million, driven by slate timing. And live services for the quarter was $1.41 billion. As a reminder, we expected Q4 net bookings to be impacted by 8 points related to slate timing. We also provided a wider guidance range to account for the dynamics of Apex Legends and EA SPORTS FC, which faced difficult comparable periods. In Apex Legends, we saw elevated engagement and monetization trends early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, monetization returned to prior norms while player sentiment and engagement remained strong. FC Mobile and Online declined year-over-year as they faced record comparables in the prior year period, fueled by World Cup tailwinds. However, FC Ultimate Team, lapping a record 20% growth in Q4 FY 2023, again, grew year-over-year, delivering low-single-digit growth. We delivered net revenue of $1.78 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $357 million, which translated to a gross margin of 79.9%, up 380 basis points year-over-year as we benefited from lower royalties and change in deferred net revenue related to product mix. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $1.19 billion, down 5% year-over-year from lower restructuring related charges. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.67. We delivered operating cash flow of $580 million in the quarter and free cash-flow of $529 million. Now let me turn to our outlook. In FY 2025, we expect to again drive results in a highly dynamic market, delivering fiscal year growth, strong cash flow and enhanced return on capital. We expect to do this despite a lighter slate, through new releases of iconic and fan favorite IP, continued execution and growth in our core live services and by staying focused and disciplined against our strategic growth initiatives. Our Q1 FY 2025 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in Q4 2024 related to slate timing and atypical seasonality as we lap difficult comps year-over-year. We expect the quarter to be impacted by 15 point headwind related to release and content timing versus prior year due to three additional title launches. Live services, including EA SPORTS FC and Apex Legends will continue to face difficult comparable periods. As a reminder, Q1 FY 2024 was the largest Q1 in company history for our global football franchise. We expect net bookings for Q1 to be $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, down 27% to down 21% year-over-year. We expect net revenue of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $240 million to $250 million and operating expenses were approximately $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.90. Now moving to our outlook for FY 2025. We expect fiscal year net bookings of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, down 2% to up 4% year-over-year with mid-single-digit growth in our core live services business, partially offset by fewer title launches, lighter catalog contributions and headwinds from our mobile business related to portfolio optimization decisions taken over the last six months. Excluding our sunset titles, we expect mobile to be up low single digit. Turning to GAAP, we expect net revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be $4.35 billion to $4.44 billion, flat to up 2% year-over-year as focus investment to drive growth is largely balanced by less marketing spend and acquisition related expenses. We expect GAAP operating margin to be 18% to 20.6%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.6% to 31.7%, the impact from change in deferred net revenue is expected to be approximately 200 to 170 basis points. We expect fiscal year GAAP EPS of $3.34 to $4. We expect our business to continue to be a strong generator of cash with operating cash flow of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver a free cash flow of about $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, roughly flat year-over-year when excluding the onetime cash tax benefit noted earlier. Expanding upon the long-term financial framework we introduced last quarter, we are introducing non-GAAP operating margin guidance through FY 2027. We believe this best reflects our confidence in accelerating growth, ability to expand margins and grow cash flows. Moreover, it provides greater transparency around the impact of our strategy and future pipeline for our shareholders. By FY 2027, we expect our GAAP operating margin to expand an additional 300 to 350 basis points and we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to expand another 150 to 200 basis points. We do not expect any additional impact from change in deferred net revenue. Please refer to our slides and FAQs for further information. Our conviction in expanding margins and accelerating growth leads us to increase our stock repurchase program and extend it by an additional year. Returning capital to shareholders is an important priority for us. Our Board has authorized a stock repurchase program of $5 billion over the next three years. We expect $1.5 billion to be returned in FY 2025 with the remainder scaling with growth in our business across FY 2026 and FY 2027. In closing, as we look ahead to our September Investor Day, I'm excited to share more on our ongoing value creation framework with insights into the growth drivers across our core business and upcoming releases from our development pipeline as well as our key strategic priorities to harness the power of our community. Now, I'll hand it back over to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thank you, Stuart. 25 years ago, there were dozens of major independent publishers in the video game space. Today, there are only a handful, and we have an incredible competitive advantage with the excellence of our creative talent, our production strength, our broad portfolio of incredible IP, including EA SPORTS and our massive player network. With these enviable strengths, we are well positioned to grow the industry and increase our market share. As we leverage the capabilities of AI, we believe it will further supercharge these differentiators. Through decades of experience and leadership, we have led through multiple transformations in our industry. Now we have an incredible opportunity in service of our players, communities and shareholders to lead through the one taking place right now. Now Stuart and I are here for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Uerkwitz : Bhavish, we're ready for your first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Cost of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, team. This is Dave on for Matt. Just a quick housekeeping question. It looks like in the new non-GAAP guidance, you're providing us a better bridge to what we're already doing in our model. So if I'm following correctly, we can now take the new non-GAAP operating margin and add or subtract for the change in deferred. And so if I'm doing the math correctly, does that bring us to an operating margin on net bookings of 31.6% to 33.4%? And then I guess, just as a quick follow up, if you could speak more to why the change in disclosure? Thanks. Stuart Canfield : Dave, many thanks for the question. This is Stuart. Let me just quickly step back and talk about why now and why the change. We know that video game companies take different approaches with regards to capitalizing software costs. As you know, we don't capitalize software costs and we expense as we go into the P&L. Thus, we felt it was important that by bringing this measure, it helps you better understand our business as we move forward, in particular, as we think about the pipeline in 2026 and 2027 and as a way for us to clearly demonstrate the conviction in the strategy and the direction that we see the business going forward into the future. Based on your assessment and using the adjustment for the change in deferred revenue, yes, you are correct. And what I would tell you is a couple of pieces. One is that, obviously, you see expansion FY 2025, which is suddenly driven by our licensing changes. Revenue mix through the year and the ongoing focus and discipline around cost as you look at the 2025 guide and the framework of OpEx around net bookings. And then secondly, as we outlined in the prepared remarks, you'll see FY 2026 and 2027 expansion driven by the pipeline as we start to bring to market through those later years and continue to enable us to drive return in the core business and importantly, still investing in the future. I'd also add that around all of that conviction and for using that metric, that would obviously have also announced the increased stock repurchase program, which is again another really meaningful signal in conjunction with this metric of where we see the business moving in the later years. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell of UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Schoell : Great. Thank you. I appreciate you've been facing very difficult comps, but can you give some color on what you're assuming for some of your larger franchises, including Apex and FC in fiscal 2025. And it appears the midpoint of the guidance is similar to your prior growth commentary, but anything you would flag that has changed relative to last earnings call in regard to your expectations for next year? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Chris. Firstly, I'll take the last question first. No material expectation shift from the framework that we outlined back in January. To your second question, broader assumption, I think it would be important to think about the phasing of how we're thinking through the year. Obviously, we put out Q1 and you'll see the challenging sort of headwinds around the title comps and slate from last year, which is really driven around we had those extra titles from before. As you think through the rest of the year and how we build out the business, obviously we look to Q2 and we see obviously the addition of college football and we expect an overall aggregated growth around our American football business. You would expect that we continue to see growth in both our core live service business and we talked to in the prepared remarks that we see that outpacing the market and sort of mid-single-digit growth. You'd expect the FC that has grown for us, and again, we grew FC again last year in 2024 expect that FC 25 being both new innovations and we continue to grow that franchise through next year. In terms of Apex, we saw great engagement and retention from players in Q4. We continue to invest behind the franchise and expect to see some advancements innovations in new seasons over the next couple of seasons in front of us that we'd start to continue to believe we drive growth back into the franchise through FY 2025. That overall brings us to a -- the profile we've put out, which is again low-single digit bookings growth for the year in a lighter release slate, but offset by growth in that core life service business. Chris Schoell : Awesome. Thank you for that. And if I can just fit in one more quick one. Just regarding the stock repurchase program, how did you think about accelerating the buyback versus other capital allocation opportunity -- opportunities you had at your disposal? Stuart Canfield : Yes, great question. I think the first thing I would just say is our dividend remains unchanged. The second part is you want to kind of reinforce from the stock repurchase program, sort of three validations through it. One is aligning the length of the program with the framework we're putting out in terms of the extended guidance we gave around the new disclosure metric. Secondly, I want to emphasize that the authorization obviously being bigger than our current one at $2.6 billion, rising to $5 billion. And basically something a signal we want to continue to scale that through the approach of a stock repurchase plan, which obviously gives us continued value in our mind back to shareholders and obviously flexibility as we scale through the next two or three years. Chris Schoell : Great. Thank you very much for the color. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mr. Eric Handler of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Eric Handler : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. You have a big live services bucket. And yes, we can decipher how much is PC and console versus mobile. But I'm wondering if you could break it up between, let's say, sports, action shoot -- action shooter and casual, how would -- like how would that break down in terms of percentages? Stuart Canfield : Hey, Eric. This is Stuart. We're not going to break down directly the splits across the live service businesses. As a reminder, the live service category encompasses not only sort of sports, also incorporates mobile, incorporates other parts of our business, whether it's our subscription business from EA Play and other parts that comprise live services. It's a heavily aggregated category across multiple levers we have by virtue of the portfolio and the strategy we carry today. Obviously, we think that through our massive online communities, they are our largest components as we come through that live service piece. When you think about FC, Sims and Apex as comprising the biggest three of those mass online communities, we look to add obviously college football this year and obviously, Madden accompanies that inside of that envelope. We also see naturally a mobile business that wraps inside of that live service number and we've talked to that we see outside of the portfolio rationalization, we see low single digit growth in that business through next year. That kind of the big compositions that we see around that service business that makes up 73% today and ultimately gives us the flexibility and agility to be convicted in the future as we layer on both the pipeline and our strategic objectives. Andrew Wilson : Yes. I might just add, one of the great differentiators of our company is actually the breadth of our live services. So if you look at FY 2024 as we come into FY 2025, at the very center of our FY 2024 was this incredible rebranding of FC and the launching and growth of that even as we lapped a World Cup year. We had Madden, again, a live service that grew and reached record levels of revenue. We had our biggest EA SPORTS year, I would argue that EA SPORTS may be one of the greatest global multi-sport media brands in the world and certainly has greater fandom than most other brands that it competes with. We had double-digit growth in the community on the Sims, which again targets a very, very different demographic of players. And when we look at the many hundreds of millions of shared user-generated content items, you are seeing the evolution of that live service into a broader community creation platform. We continue to build resilience into Apex. And as a community sentiment of that grew 29 points over the last fiscal year. And as we're primed to continue to grow and expand that live service, we have great opportunity. And again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, I've just spent a whole bunch of time with the collective Battlefield team, playing what they're building and it is going to be another tremendous live service. And if you really use FC as the blueprint and you think about across platforms, across modalities, across business models, across geographies and also branching fan beyond the bounds of the traditional game to create truly a football fan platform that really extends the magnitude of the live service. This really is at the very center of our strategy when we talk about building content and experiences that entertain and engage massive online communities. And so, as we think about this going forward, we believe this differentiates us from the marketplace in videogames and certainly in the marketplace in entertainment and really positions us for real growth against what these emerging generations are looking for in the context of their entertainment consumption. Eric Handler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Marok : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on Apex, if I could. Since it was a limited-time mode back in 2020, Respawn has kind of always been pretty adamant that the solo mode was never going to come back to Apex despite players clamoring for it, because it didn't mesh with their view of player behavior. So with that mode coming back in season 21 for a long-time for a limited time mode, I guess what changed? Is that part of the easier onboarding that you were referring to in the prepared remarks or something you're leaning into based on player signals? Andrew Wilson : Well, again, I think what the Respawn team has done and continues to do incredibly well is really work in a very transparent open way with the community. Again, this is an incredible community of hundreds of millions of players. Retention is very high. They're a very vocal community and the Respawn team may be better than many other teams in the industry works very closely with that community. And I think what we're starting to see is the evolution of both the player personality, the Apex player personality, Apex is a game and how Respawn serves that community broadly. And this will be one of those steps. But you shouldn't imagine that this is the sum total of those steps as we really think about both expansion of modalities at play for Apex when we think about deep culturalization on a geographic basis to attract new and more deeply engaged global communities. And as we think of -- as we look to what the Respawn team is doing over time, we believe that this will be a cornerstone of our live service business for many, many years to come. Andrew Marok : All right. Great. Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Colin Sebastian : Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, first on the Mobile segment kind of broadly, I understand the different puts and takes on that with the pipeline. But also just trying to understand a little bit better, the underlying growth expectations for the Mobile segment of the industry, EA's market share expectations as you look out to fiscal 2026 and 2027 in that segment and what the key drivers are there? And then apologies if I missed the Stuart, but just in terms of that fiscal 2026, 2027 outlook, how should we think about the step-up between those years into 2026 and into 2027, if that contemplates any changing dynamics around the competitive landscape next year. Thanks. Andrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. Let me start with kind of the mobile macro. As you've heard from us before, mobile is a very important platform to us. We've spent the last number of years really focusing our mobile business and driving meaningful profitability in that area of the business, which hasn't always been the traditional shape of the mobile business in the industry. As we look forward, our expectation is over the next 12 months or so, we probably have low-to-mid-single-digit growth in the mobile market overall. But it's still -- the mobile market remains a fairly high-risk opportunity that requires significant user acquisition cost to kind of ramp a new mobile game. And so, when we kind of couple what are increasingly longer development cycles in mobile, sometimes two to three years and we hear stories of five, six, seven years in the marketplace, meaningful user acquisition spend and long ramp times once you get to-market, mobile isn't an easy market to capitalize on. With that being said, we feel like our mobile businesses is in a very good position given its profitability. We'll be leaning into our massive online communities around FC, around Madden, around the Sims [indiscernible] will be mobile native and we'll also be looking at opportunities to invest in a very limited number of mobile native titles that we believe have breakout potential. Stuart Canfield : Colin, with regard to your second question, we basically -- in my prepared remarks, we framed up the range of growth we expect to see through 2026 and 2027. So range through that entire period. But we referenced it through the new non-GAAP operating margin disclosure we made and we are referencing expanding 150 to 200 basis points on the 25 platform that we just put out. So intent there is to demonstrate the growth acceleration in both 2026 to 2027, as we think about growth through driven by sort of growth in a core business from team expand player acquisition, engagement retention. We know the live services to Andrew's answer on the call a second how we continue to expand both growth through the releases and our ongoing business. The new IP we've talked to in the pipeline that continues to give us lever and growth on-top in the later years. And as we see leverage from the cost structure and investment all relates down to that non-GAAP operating margin expansion through 2026 and 2027. Colin Sebastian : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Michael Hickey : Hey, Andrew, Stuart, Andrew, Katie, thanks for taking our questions. Andrew, you had some pretty interesting comments recently at a conference talking about sort of efficiency and expansion with AI. I think you gave one example where you're talking about building out game environments like stadiums, you said that process went from six months to six weeks. So pretty incredible efficiency step-up. Just curious how you're thinking about further deploying AI on other development processes, other games, other platforms like mobile. You talked about the duration of development on mobile, maybe there's some efficiencies there. And then as a follow-up, just curious on the generative AI NPC in key franchises like sports, Battlefield, Sims, the opportunity you see there over-time? Thanks, guys. Andrew Wilson : Yes, great question. First is, we're still very early in the AI evolution or at least the generative AI evolution. As a company, we've been deeply tied to AI since our inception. It has been the very center of all of the games that we create replicating human intelligence in the context of a gameplay experience. But certainly as we think about the wave of generative AI today and as it merges into artificial general intelligence broadly, we're still very early. But the things I talked about in the conference was really both two-fold. One, how do we get more efficient and the stat I used was we've moved from being able to create stadiums from six months-to six weeks. And my expectation is that will continue to shrink over time. Maybe even more profound than that was we went from -- when we build a game and we have animation and run cycles. So in FIFA 23, we had 36 run cycles, which gave you kind of believability of human performance inside of that game. When we launched FC 24, we had 1,200 run cycles. And so again, starting to add to the individuality and uniqueness of each player and delivering our players more immersion in the game, a more engaging experience that is more true to what they watch on television on a Sunday afternoon. And so, as we think about the first pillar of generative AI for us, we're really looking at, how can it make us more efficient, how can it give our developers more power, how can it give them back more time and allow them to get to the fund more quickly. When we think about that -- our expectation is that there is meaningful opportunity for us. We've done analysis across all of our development processes. And right now, based on our early assessment, we believe that more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI. And we've got teams across the company really looking to execute against that. And the second phase for us, of course, is how do we further expand our games, how do we build bigger worlds with more characters and more interesting storylines. And if efficiency starts to really take place over the next one to three years, our expectation is that over a three to five-year time horizon, we will be able to as part of our massive online communities and blockbuster storytelling, build bigger, more immersive worlds that engage more players uniquely around the world. And we think about that on a three to five-year time horizon. And perhaps on a five-year plus time horizon, we think about how do we take all of those tools we create and offer those to the community at large so that we can actually get new and interesting and innovative and different types of game experiences. Again, not to replace what we do, but to augment, enhance, extend, expand the nature of what interactive entertainment can be and much the way YouTube did for traditional film and television. One of the great advantages, of course, that we have is we do have 40 years of data. And so as I think about efficiency over one to three years, expansion over three to five years transformation on a five year time horizon, it's actually very plausible that with 40 years of owned data that we have to feed into these models, we actually may be able to accelerate that timeframe. And I would tell you there is a real hunger amongst our developers to get to this as quickly as possible, because again, the holy grail for us is to build bigger, more innovative, more creative, more fun games more quickly so that we can entertain more people around the world on a global basis at a faster rate. Michael Hickey : Thank you. Andrew Uerkwitz : Operator, we have one more question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our final question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two parter, if I can to Andrew. From a big picture standpoint, if you take a step back, I'd love to get your take on two themes we continue to hear about across the gaming landscape. One, the market opportunity for more dynamic ad insertion across more traditional AAA games across different formats and how you think that might be a revenue opportunity over the medium to long term? And the second, we've seen some fairly successful examples recently of IT adaptation out of the gaming landscape into the broader media landscape. What's your current thinking about that IT adaptation landscape going forward and what that might sit as a market opportunity for EA? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Let me start with the second part of your question, then I'll move into the first part of your question. Thinking about what you've heard from us for some time now is as we work with our global communities of players and we really listen to what they're looking for, what they hope to do is really interact and engage with their favorite IP, which as it turns out is the biggest IP in the world, many of which sit within our portfolio, they want to both play, create, watch and connect. And so our expectation on a go-forward basis is that even as we expand the definition of play and the types of things you can do in the context of these interactive worlds that as we bring in more creation opportunity in these worlds, that in and of itself will also spawn more watch. Watch traditionally, of course, is well, do we make a movie, do we make a television show and our expectation is that we will see more of that. But in addition to that, we expect that we'll see many, many billions of hours of content created by our communities, both in the context of what goes on inside the game and in the context of what goes on outside the game. And of course, the most important part of that will be out the ability for players to connect with each other in the context of play, create and watch. And so while we look at what's going in the industry right now, we see the fact that gaming IP is now manifesting inside of film and television and is topping those charts in addition to topping the interactive entertainment charts. Our expectation as we build out our portfolio is that we will get that benefit. That will be a tailwind for us. But in addition to that, we're really thinking about how we engage our players across the expansion of play, inviting them to connect and expand and extend and enhance the worlds that we create. The watch element that comes from that, we talked about billions of hours watched in FC alone, you should imagine that is also across Madden and the Sims and Battlefield and Apex, but really built on a deep sense of social connection. And that's something that a company like us has a unique ability to deliver for our players that maybe hasn't been the case with traditional entertainment companies. To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front. And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences. But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens beyond the bounds of a traditional game experience. Our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us. We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences, but more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Okay. Well, thank you all for being here, and thank you for the great questions. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering an incredible year. To close, I'm extremely excited about what our future holds. I look forward -- and look forward to sharing more about our pipeline and longer-term strategy to drive growth at our Investor Day in New York later in the year. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. We started our FY '25 strong. We beat our net bookings guidance and we executed across our business, as we entertained and connected hundreds of millions of people around the world. Throughout Q1 we drove progress along our three strategic priorities of entertaining and engaging massive online communities, telling blockbuster stories, and harnessing the power of community in and around our games. This progress paves the way for growth in Q2 and beyond. I'm thankful and inspired by the continued incredible work of our fantastic teams to deliver the entertainment that our global community of players wants today and tomorrow. Our focus continues to center around entertaining more players for more time across more geographies. And we believe there are secular tailwinds in social media and sports that favor our enviable position as a Company that will drive sustainable, long-term growth built across the engagement modalities of play, create, watch, and connect. A fundamental truth of the human experience is that people have always come together through sports to compete, collaborate and celebrate community. Today, EA SPORTS experiences are advancing this truth through incredible authenticity, innovation, and immersion. We are becoming increasingly ingrained in the fabric of sports culture and fandom, as our audiences look to us for cutting-edge ways to connect with the sports they love and to share that passion with their friends and families all year long. Sport leagues the world over trust us as a powerful, longstanding partner, as we work together to engage, entertain and inspire fans across generations and geographies. This is a huge opportunity for our players, our partners and our stockholders. We believe the lines between traditional sports consumption and interactive sports entertainment will continue to blur as hundreds of millions of fans increasingly connect with their favorite athletes, clubs and competitions through EA SPORTS. This quarter, in EA SPORTS FC '24, our exceptional teams celebrated real-life football events on console, PC and mobile with UEFA EURO 2024 and CONMEBOL Copa America 2024, driving even better than expected monetization. We also released a high-quality, heart-racing title in F1 '24 as the sport's current season delivers high levels of drama and competition. We blurred the lines in Madden NFL 24, connecting real-life cultural events to in-game experiences with live content that fuels deeper engagement. We were onsite for the NFL draft to support the immediate inclusion of rookie players into Madden NFL 24, resulting in an expanded social experience as they played live in front of millions of fans before even stepping on the field. Our teams are also engineering moments that ignite the football fan community with unique and valuable content that extends the in-game experience, like our collaboration to bring leading sports personality Pat McAfee into the game, the special Michael Vick edition, or our in-game Ring of Honor event. These intentional experiences and live content combined with deep and innovative gameplay drove more time spent and increased engagement in our community, and drove momentum and growth in the quarter. This speaks not just to how central the franchise is to the very fabric of American professional football, but also how our games are such a unique and valuable expression of fandom that combines the authenticity of the real world sport, deep innovation and gameplay, and creative content that energizes and engages communities, leading to further growth in our business. As we continue to build massive online communities across our entire sports business, we are equally focused on prioritizing our owned-IP across our broad entertainment portfolio, which contains some of the deepest and most relevant properties in the world. Apex Legends is an important part of our story. Q1 was largely in line with our expectations, and our commitment to evolving and learning is a foundational part of our strategy to return Apex Legends to growth. During the quarter, our teams continued to introduce changes to this multibillion-dollar franchise as they test and iterate in the lead up to Seasons '22, '23, and beyond, where they will deliver even more content and bigger advancements, spread across geographies and new modes of play. We continue to engage and inspire fans across the massive Sims 4 community, as we roll out more content updates to this beloved franchise. Q1 saw healthy engagement throughout the community with excitement building for the launch of the Lovestruck Pack as a throwback to original Sims games with classic items. We are committed to entertaining our loyal Sims 4 fans with 15-plus updates over the coming year, while working on introducing multiple new experiences into the Sims universe over the coming years. We expect all of this to grow our community and deepen engagement with user generated content serving as a growth multiplier to the franchise overall. As season seven of Battlefield 2042 wraps up, one thing is clear, each season of the game has shown our team's unique ability to listen, learn, and draw inspiration from the community to deepen connection with the franchise. Players continue to be passionate about the Battlefield franchise, which has surpassed over 25 million players over the last 12 months. The community is energized by what our teams are doing and excited for what comes next. This is not just one of our top priorities, it is also one of the most ambitious projects in our history. We have brought together the very best team coupled with the resources and technology they need to deliver an epic Battlefield experience. I am excited about what is to come next, as we continue to make progress across our strategic priorities. As I look to Q2, our sports-packed quarter began with a bang, the successful debut of EA SPORTS College Football 25. This is a monumental moment for EA SPORTS. We are returning to a sport we love, reimagined for a new generation of platforms, breaking new ground with athletes through the world's largest single sport NIL program, and delivering an experience that has absolutely ignited college football fans both longtime and new around the U.S., and across the world. Our multi-year journey to College Football '25 reflects the vision, leadership, and deep determination of our teams, and it is also a testament to the amazing support that we have received from universities, partners, athletes and fans. Thank you all for helping us make this possible. This new College Football experience is an impressive creative and technological achievement. Creating 150 unique stadiums and over 11,000 player likenesses couldn't be done without EA's deep history of being a technology leader, and by our incredibly passionate and talented teams harnessing the power of AI and machine learning to deliver truly amazing entertainment. We are also giving players the tools to shape their own experience through Team Builder, an extensive creation and customization UGX suite that enables players to create their own teams, jersey combinations, logos, field designs, and more, and then publish and share their creations within the game. To date, we've already seen nearly one million teams created by our players, many of which can now be enjoyed by others in the game, deepening social connections and increasing engagement in our community. College Football continues to elevate EA SPORTS leadership in American Football by creating valuable new opportunities for sports fans. The community has embraced our groundbreaking EA SPORTS MVP Bundle of the deluxe editions of EA SPORTS College Football 25 and Madden NFL 25, demonstrating the appetite amongst core fans of the sport for both high-quality NFL and college football experiences. To further build momentum in our American Football ecosystem, the 2025 edition of Madden NFL will significantly push the franchise forward. The title will deliver enhanced audio and visuals, an all-new version of FieldSENSE, and innovative physics technology, getting players even closer to the action with their favorite NFL superstars. With two unique yet complementary products in the market, this is a huge step forward in significantly growing our American Football community. This is just the beginning of what we are going to be able to deliver for fans for the United States' biggest sport. Following a historic brand relaunch embraced by players, fans, and partners the world over, EA SPORTS FC 25 is going to be a giant step forward. On top of the existing strength of this global franchise, we see many more opportunities to grow its reach, engagement, and impact. We are forecasting franchise growth in FY '25. FC 25 will feature more innovation, as well as more realistic and authentic gameplay driven by enhanced tactical sophistication using AI and realworld footballing data. It will also introduce an entirely new, deeply-social 5v5 experience called Rush available across all major modes in the game, and a new content capture and creation tool. In total, our entire FC platform will be a bigger, deeper set of experiences at the center of the fandom and culture of the World's game. Looking beyond the second quarter, we continue to make progress across our pipeline to deliver on our strategy. We further engaged and connected with the massive online community of skate as we introduced fans to the lore of San Vansterdam with new gameplay revealed at Summer GameFest. We also unveiled the blockbuster storytelling of Dragon Age : The Veilguard an epic experience based in an expansive world, filled with arresting visuals, and introducing a cast of diverse, complex characters, and incredible combat all tied together by a rich singleplayer narrative. We are committed to delivering more excitement, exploration, creation, and connection for more players and fans across generations, platforms and geographies. And we will achieve this through our passionate and talented teams, our world-class IP, and our ability to drive innovation through our deep expertise in technology, which will accelerate our innovation and our development velocity. Now, I'd like to hand it off to Stuart for a deeper dive into our business. Stuart Canfield : Thanks Andrew, and good afternoon everyone. We've had a great start to FY '25, with Q1 results beating our own expectations on both the top and bottom line as we continue to execute on our strategy and drive progress in delivering against our long-term financial framework of accelerating growth, delivering operating leverage, and increasing cash flow. Foundational to this execution has been our focused investment in our talented teams to support our growth initiatives and deliver amazing experiences to our fans. Early indicators of this momentum include the outstanding reception for EA SPORTS College Football 25, the promising early signs across both EA SPORTS Madden NFL 25 and EA SPORTS FC 25, plus the announcement of the Dragon Age : The Veilguard release in the fall. As momentum builds, we feel confident in achieving our fiscal year guidance. Now, turning to our Q1 results. Our net bookings results were above our expectations as our teams delivered more content to larger audiences resulting in greater-than-anticipated engagement and monetization in our core live services. We also initiated our previously announced enhanced stock repurchase program plan, which is projected to return $5 billion over the next three years, aligning with our progress towards achieving our long-term financial objectives. In the quarter, we saw total net bookings of $1.26 billion. As a reminder, our prior year period benefitted from more releases and a World Cup tailwind to our global football business. Full game net bookings was $168 million as we compare to three full game title releases from a year ago, Star Wars Jedi : Survivor, EA SPORTS PGA Tour, and Super Mega Baseball 4. Our live services and other net bookings was $1.09 billion, highlighted by EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 outperformance in the quarter. The greater-than-expected results from EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 are a strong proof point in the power of a thriving community in and around our games. During the quarter, we saw sustained momentum late in the title's cycle with both weekly average users in Ultimate Team and total net bookings up double-digits year-over-year. As Andrew spoke to earlier, our intentional focus on delivering fun gameplay, real-world connection, and compelling live content year-round is foundational to driving deeper engagement and expanding our communities as we build platforms in and around our games. Apex Legends' year-over-year declines improved sequentially, and came in line with our expectations. The team remains focused on investing behind and delivering against a yearlong strategy of meaningfully updating the experiences in Seasons 22, 23, and beyond. Turning to the EA SPORTS FC franchise, results came in better than expected but down for the quarter against double-digit growth in the prior year period, which benefited from tailwinds relating to the World Cup. It's worth noting that life-to-date, our new EA SPORTS FC franchise is up mid-single digits versus the prior version. EA SPORTS FC Mobile delivered a record Q1 net bookings result, benefiting from double-digit growth in spender acquisition as a result of gameplay improvements and real-life events. FC Mobile is the blueprint for our mobile strategy, grounded in leveraging the expanded access points offered via the mobile platform to continue to grow our largest franchises. On a GAAP basis, we delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.66 billion, down 14% year-over-year. As a reminder, year-over-year declines were driven primarily by slate timing of full game releases. GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by focused investments in teams supporting our largest growth opportunities. As a result, earnings per share was $1.04. We delivered operating cash flow of $120 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow is $1.86 billion, up 3% year-over-year. In the first quarter, we returned $425 million to stockholders through stock buybacks and dividends, a 13% year-over-year increase as we implemented our new stock repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. Q2 is an action-packed EA SPORTS quarter, with one successful launch down and two of our biggest launches in Madden NFL 25 and FC 25 coming up. We are also releasing new experiences in some of our largest franchises, like Season 22 for our Apex Legends fans. These efforts underpin our expectation to deliver our largest Q2 net bookings quarter in our history. Let me break down some of the assumptions that are incorporated into our guidance. First, we have seen an incredible start to EA SPORTS College Football 25 with record week one engagement for our sports franchises in North America, and positive Ultimate Team momentum. We are only 11 days post-launch, but we are very excited about the opportunity to significantly grow our American Football community. Second, we look forward to the launch of EA SPORTS Madden NFL 25, as we continue to deliver a differentiated and outstanding NFL experience following a record-setting EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24. Third, we expect a strong launch to EA SPORTS FC 25 at the end of the quarter, setting up the franchise to grow over EA SPORTS FC 24 for the full year, with new ways to play, tactical improvements, and a revamped social experience expected to drive healthy engagement in our largest community. Fourth, we remain prudent in our approach to Apex Legends, as the team introduces new innovations and game mechanics to the community with Season 22. And lastly, if rates remain unchanged, we expect minimal impact from FX. As a result of these assumptions, we expect Q2 net bookings of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, up 7% to up 13% year-over-year, or up 8% to up 13% in constant currency. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, and cost of revenue to be $420 million to $450 million. We expect GAAP operating expenses in Q2 to be between $1.19 billion and $1.2 billion, up 10% to 11% year-over-year, driven primarily by restructuring-related charges and continued investment behind our long-term growth opportunities. We expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.76 to $0.93. As a reminder, we benefited from a $92 million one-time tax benefit recognized in the year-ago period, and we expect to incur $65 million in restructuring charges related to our February restructuring event. Now, turning to the full year. To date, our execution has been strong and we expect our momentum to continue as we have seen fantastic player response across our EA SPORTS branded titles. We are excited about our upcoming FY '25 slate, including EA SPORTS titles Madden NFL 25 and FC 25, and Dragon Age : The Veilguard. We remain focused on executing these title releases and delivering our core live services. As a result, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2025 net bookings guidance range of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, down 2% to up 4% year-over-year. We are reaffirming our guidance for our other full year metrics. Our first quarter results are a testament to our incredible brands and our talented teams, who are delivering experiences that continue to grow and engage our communities through innovative and interactive experiences. We saw this execution in our ability to sustain EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 momentum through the quarter, deliver healthy engagement in our global football business, and continue to improve our mobile business, which remains an important entry point for our largest franchises. Looking forward, we expect to continue to invest with sharpened focus behind our three strategic pillars, as we position ourselves for accelerated growth in FY '26 and beyond. Our teams look forward to sharing more on our long-term growth opportunities and initiatives at our Investor Day on September 17. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew Wilson : Thanks, Stuart. Our strong Q1 demonstrated the determination of our teams and the resiliency of our business. Traditional entertainment is being challenged as consumer preferences change and technology continues to disrupt business models. We are in a fundamentally different position. We have already navigated our shift in distribution, consumption is only growing and becoming more concentrated in our franchises, and we are unlocking new business models. We have an incredible competitive advantage with the excellence of our creative talent, our production strength, our broad portfolio of incredible IP, including EA SPORTS, and a massive player network. With these enviable strengths, we are well-positioned to grow the industry and increase our market share. And now Stuart and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two bigger picture ones if I can. You've talked a lot in the last year about how Madden had become more global in scope. Can you talk a little bit about how you plan on building in that momentum with Madden as a franchise, as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months to continue to build scale, from a global perspective? And the second question would be on EA, FC. Obviously last year was an interesting year, because you were moving the brand around and having to execute against that. What are some of the key learnings from the rebranding exercise you went through 12 months ago that are sort of informing how you also continue to build scale around EA, FC and how the product might change in the years ahead? Thanks so much. Andrew Wilson : Okay. There's a lot in there. Two great questions. First let me touch on Madden. I think as you reference global you think about international geographies and certainly we're pushing hard there. And the NFL is doing an incredible job of building a fan base internationally. They're doing more and more games internationally every year. Athletes are leaning into their fan bases internationally every year. But as we think about Madden growth it's not just about geographic growth. It is about demographic growth. It is about platform growth. And ultimately it will be growth driven by new and interesting business models. And so, as you look at our Madden experiences broadly, well we've continued to build out modalities for the core and to ensure that we continue to fulfill the needs and motivations of our core players who have been with us for many, many years. A lot of what you're also starting to see including new modes that we've brought in in recent years, are attracting new younger players. You also see what we're doing with Madden Mobile, and the constant evolution of that franchise in its mobile incarnation. As we look forward, we do think about this. We think that the combination of Madden plus College, will overall grow our football community. We're already seeing that this year, with the start of College football in Q2. We think that brings in both younger players and new players that either have never played Madden, or have not played Madden for a couple of years. You'll see us invest meaningfully in new modalities of play that are really interesting, particularly in a social connection context for these new younger fans that are coming into our football experiences. You'll see us start to develop more and more modalities of play, across devices including mobile. And over the course of time, you should also expect us to branch into new and different business models that, we expect will expand our audience. This is the biggest game in this country by a wide margin, i.e. American Football both in the context of College and the NFL. We know the sport is growing internationally, by virtue of access that fans have to the sport now through cable and streaming. And we know that our games, both EA Sports College Football '25 and the upcoming Madden '25 are a meaningful way that fans around the world get to come and experience their fandom, share their fandom with their friends and grow their fandom over time. And so our expectation is, that this is just the first step in how we grow our football community. To get your second part on EA Sports FC, again, I just want to thank our teams again across development, marketing, our many licensed partners, the many athletes that form the recenter of that game. It was truly an extraordinary relaunch of that franchise and has put us in a position to grow. And as we went through that transformation and we talked to you about that, we talked about our ability to expand gameplay into areas that, we were otherwise unable to do. We talked about expanding the commercial relationships, with big global sports brands that we're unable to work with. We talked about expanding beyond the bounds of traditional play, i.e. doing things with our fans that are outside the 11-on-11 game. And certainly we've got five-on-five that's coming into FC this year. And we talked about moving much, much faster in the context of how we develop, and evolve the experience over time. And so, many of those lessons were learned through that process. Our objective was to do more in-game. Our objective was to do more with commercial partners. Our objective was to do more beyond the bounds of the game. And our objective was to move really, really quickly at the speed of the cultural evolution that is happening in our world. And I would say our teams did an extraordinary job in doing that. And much of the learning we got was that we're headed in exactly the right direction. So as you look at FC this year, we are expanding modalities of play. As you look at the many things we're doing with new commercial partners that are expanding what people can do inside the game and outside the game. And later this year, you'll see us do more and more beyond the bounds of the game. We're going to talk more about that at our Investor Day in September. But the biggest thing that we've been able to do since the rebrand is just move much, much faster. And I know that is great for our teams, but more importantly that's really, really good for our players globally. We'll take our next question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Cost : Hi everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess sticking with American Football for a little bit here. When we think about Ultimate Team for the College football game, is there any potential for cannibalization of Madden Ultimate Team just as a function of, how successful College football has been with those 5 million players in the game? Obviously you can buy a copy of each game relatively easily, but an hour spent in College football Ultimate Team is an hour that you can't spend in Madden Ultimate Team. So how should we expect those two to interact? Is there potential for cannibalization? That's question one. And then question two is just you called out AI and ML efficiencies in the process of developing the College football game. I'm wondering if there's anything that you'd call out in particular where you were able to speed up a process, or do something faster, higher level quality, because of some of those applications of AI? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Great questions. First let me touch on the Madden Plus College. Again as we went into this as we look to reinvent and relaunch College football after over a decade, a few things are true. One is there's more football fans broadly in this country than there has ever been. Two, College football in and of itself has grown dramatically, since we were in the marketplace with a game over 10 years ago. And the combination of those two things, led us to believe that these two products, or these two services would be complementary in nature. And that in fact College would bring in new players to the overall community, and actually bring players back who hadn't been with us for some time. It's very early, but I would tell you our thesis is so far been proven correct. We have grown the community overall. There's been a meaningful percentage of players, who have come in through the College experience are new to us, or haven't been with us for over two years. The second thing is that the MVP bundle, the combination of Madden and College as a pre-order performed ahead of our expectations and is doing really, really well. And while pre-orders are in perfect metric, they are typically directionally sound. And that would suggest to us that the broad complementary nature of College plus Madden is proving out. As it relates to ultimate team specifically, one of the things that our teams have done really well, is actually think through what does it mean for a player who plays both College and plays Madden? And how do we give them value across both of those gameplay experiences? And ultimately how do we make those experiences greater than the sum of their parts? Again, we're coming into the Madden season off the back of an incredibly strong Madden '24, incredibly strong engagement in the off season, in the traditional football off season, which for us typically is demonstrative of good forward progress against the next iteration. Madden '25 is going to be the best Madden we've ever made. I know I say that every year, but the teams continue to out-do themselves, including a whole bunch of new modes and new ways to play, combined with a whole new set of players that have come into the community, through College football that will be providing a path. If they haven't already bought the MVP bundle apart from College into Madden and building gameplay experiences that are not only complimentary from the ability to purchase both, but a complimentary from the ability to experience both. And so again, it's early days now Q2, College is off to an incredible start, pre-orders in Madden are off to a really strong start. Our expectation that the two will be complimentary over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell from UBS. Your line is open. Chris Schoell : Great. Thank you. So fiscal 1Q came in ahead of your expectations and fiscal 2Q guidance also seemed stronger than where the Street was prior to today. Can you just help us think through why we didn't see that flow through, to the full year outlook? And is it fair to say you were trending toward the higher end of your prior range? And you also cited strong soccer performance, contributing to the fiscal 1Q beat recognized it was towards the end of the quarter. But can you help us size uplift you think Copa and EURO provided and might not repeat as we look forward? Thank you. Stuart Canfield : Hi, Chris. Thanks for the questions. Stuart, just stepping back. I think I mean, yes, we're building great momentum. We think about the guidance coming out of Q1. We just talked a little bit at length around Q2 with Andrew's commentary a second ago and how we're thinking about framing up the quarter. We've also reflected the continued progress we're seeing in the momentum we're building. And the return to growth by default of that guide range inside of Q2. Also, I think it's reflective of the momentum that we're building, as we deliver on the long-term financial framework we're laying out, which accelerated growth, increasing operating levels and driving cash back to shareholders. We think inside of Q2. Obviously we reflected the combination of an aggregate growth in football. We do believe FC although only having one week inside the quarter, does continue growing live services, and will assess where full game goes as we tackle the transition last year, and brought players into the game up front. We are being prudent and pragmatic around how we see Apex over the first six weeks and the last six weeks of Season 21 as we head into Season 22. And that's the first time that we've seen two American Football tiles launch in the same quarter as you think about both the sales curve, of College over the next sort of two to five weeks. And secondly, how we see players engage in time both between Madden and College as we were at the Q2 guide. As we think about the full year and reiterating obviously we're literally four months into the year. We have both Madden FC and Dragon Age still ahead of us. We do expect by phasing to continue, to show growth and build growth out through the full year. Obviously, we'll look to come back in our next earnings once we get through those major releases at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Carpenter from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Cory Carpenter : Great. Thanks for the question. What did it ask about the video game after strike? How would you frame the potential risk of disruption into the business broadly in the near term? And then specifically at what point could this start to have an impact on your release schedule? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : So let me let me first say, we deeply value our talent actors who are an important part of the work we do, to deliver the incredible entertainment experiences that our players enjoy around the world. We're working very closely. This is not an EA specific situation. This is an industry specific situation, and we're working diligently to negotiate at the table. The way it works now in terms of our product specifically, is that the strike is limited to games commencing production after September 2023, including live service games. So we don't expect any near term disruption, to any of the games we haven't developed, or any of the live services we're currently running. That being said, we committed to continue to bargain in good faith, and are hopeful that the parties. Can expediently resolve our issues at the bargaining table. But we're not, we're not anticipating any significant short-term impact at EA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok from Raymond James. Your line is open. Andrew Marok : Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I could please. First, can you remind us of some of the factors that go into the decision to release, or not to release a game on both previous gen and current gen consoles and how those factors maybe are set up for your big five franchises? Maybe thinking of College football on Gen9 only and Madden on Gen8 and Gen9, but some features only on Gen9? Thanks. Andrew Wilson : It's not a perfect science, I would say on balance. It comes down to where we expect the player base to show up. You know, at a scale that makes supporting the platform make financial sense for us. It is not a zero cost to support each generation of platform. And typically as we think about where the where the player communities are showing up at the greatest level. That's where we're supporting those platforms. Typically what has happened is our larger franchises, have had more dispersed platform engagement by virtue of the fact that they are more geographically diverse and different geographies evolve at different rates across those platform generations. Many of the smaller franchise, or the franchises that don't represent our biggest. Those players typically are migrating much more quickly to new platforms. And as you think about a property like College in particular, something that hasn't been on the platforms for the last 10 years. We really made a decision to be forward-looking on that, and really developing the team works incredibly hard on College. And if you've read any of the reviews on College, what they've been able to do on these new platforms is truly extraordinary. And the uptake that we've seen across the new platforms would suggest that the platform decisions we made were the right ones. And there was a question earlier around AI as it related to College. And the reality is, is we had an incredible team working on this, but we had to get 11,000 new star player heads into the game. For those that don't track our industry or track our sports games in particular, we typically in any given year will develop about 500 to 1000 star heads inside of one of our games. And over the course of a platform generation, through the hand tooling of that, we ultimately fill out the full roster of star heads in our games. And of course there are ebbs and flows in that. But as we were launching College on a new generation of platforms, to a new generation of fans with the world's largest single sport NIL deal, where image was a really important part of the process, getting 11,000 star heads into the game was a top priority for us. The reality is our teams are incredible and built workflows to facilitate that, but they were amplified and accelerated through AI and machine learning. And we were able to take in a whole plethora of photo imagery across 11,000 players and build workflows out where AI and machine learning would generate heads. And our very talented artists would be able to come in and touch up and enhance those heads, versus having to go through the full head development program. In the absence of AI, we simply would not have been able to deliver College football at the level we did, even though we'd given the team many, many years in development. And so, to answer both of those questions, typically when we think about past gen versus future gen, it comes down to geographic dispersion and it comes down to community dispersion. And it comes down to where we think the greatest gameplay will happen. And as it relates to College specifically, it was a decision that we made, because we were really building the franchise for the future. It was the first time we had done it in 10 years, and the level of gameplay and the level of visual fidelity that we did, was a combination of many years of work of our incredible teams, amplified and accelerated by AI. Something that we just wouldn't have been able to do as little as two or three years ago. Andrew Marok : Really helpful. Thank you for the detail. And if I could sneak one in, I got asked my quarterly Apex question. I wanted to touch on that player reception to the Apex battle pass changes. I guess what does that reaction say about the Apex player's ability to bear further monetization, and how does it kind of inform your approach going forward? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Yes, I mean, first I would say we're really excited for the upcoming season '22 and '23 of Apex. The Respawn team has been working diligently on all of the things that are going in, you know, profound improvements in gameplay and modalities of play and geographic culturalization. These seasons that will be bigger and more content rich than usual. And we're giving our teams the time to create - develop those updates. And our expectation is that, our players will receive them incredibly well. As we think about battle pass specifically, so we just - take a step back. The team is always iterating and innovating, to bring about the best experience for our players. Our intention this time round was really, to improve the overall value and experience across our battle pass offering for our players. And we wanted to kind of make sure that things were approachable realistic and accessible for our global community. That being said, even as we iterate through that, our Respawn team listens and learns and is it is meaningfully connected with their community. And as it became apparent that the community had real feedback around how we're dealing with some of those aspects of battle pass. The team was able to react and make those changes dramatically. I don't think this speaks to broader monetization overall for the franchise. I don't think this speaks to the community's propensity, to want to spend in the context of their ongoing live service experience that is Apex. I just think it was one of those moments where we made a series of really positive changes. And in search of, ongoing iteration around how we deliver those changes, we did some things the community weren't aligned with. And we've been able to realign with them and our expectations, we moved towards '22 and '23, that the community will be incredibly receptive, to what we believe are going to be two seasons of incredible content. Stuart Canfield : Andrew, just to add on quickly to that, just to talk about sort of the financial framework we're using, just to kind of reiterate, although we saw those declines year-over-year, they were in line with our expectations for the foundation of Q1. We have put in place, you think about the Q2 guide, given the strength I talked to in the whole framework for EA, a more measured outlook, particularly as we introduced new innovations and game mechanics. And Andrew just alluded to coming into Season 22 and 23. We do think the comps obviously naturally get easier, through the second half and back into the year. It's a long way to go in the year, but know that we've been more moderating Q2 as we come through that guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew, maybe just to start off higher level, one question we get quite frequently from investors, really is trying to understand that an industry level, the relatively, I guess, sluggish growth trends in the past few years. We talked a lot about competition for time and money, but are there other dynamics at work that you would highlight that are external TA that, could then turn into catalyst, or breathe some oxygen into the demand side of the market? And then my second question is on the Sims franchise, and I appreciate some of the updates there. And as one of the 10 poll franchises and brands, hoping to hear a bit more about how you think about growth there, for example, reducing friction to bring in more players, or expanding on to other platforms, or other initiatives, that would be very helpful? Thank you. Andrew Wilson : Great, great questions. The macro, as we think about the industry broadly, and I speak to this more about the industry than I do around Electronic Arts specifically, is that we did see some pretty meaningful peaks coming through COVID around both play and watch in the context of our interactive entertainment industry. As a company, we've continued to grow out of out of COVID. That hasn't been true for the whole industry. And so, certainly I think there's some impact there. We also see and I've talked about this in past calls, we are seeing kind of a secular shift happening in the context of our industry and that is a movement towards the biggest franchises in the industry franchises that facilitate an expanded definition of play, the ability for the community to come and create content that extends and enhances their experience. The ability to go and watch that content. What we see now is 25%, 30% of all engagement in our industry is actually watching content, not just playing content. Incidentally, that correlates to monetization at nearly the same levels as playing does, over the course of time. And connection is becoming a really, really important part. As I watch our community play inside of our games. The modality of play that involves deep connection with their friends, is becoming more and more important. And so, I do think as we look at the industry broadly, not all of the industry has been making that transition at the same rate. I do believe Electronic Arts has been working diligently against that transition. If you look at our three strategic pillars, two of the three are about massive online communities, and enhancing the power of communities beyond the bounds of games. And we've been investing meaningfully in those. And you're starting to see that come about in the context of what you see inside of College football, what you'll see inside of Madden, what you'll see inside of FC. Certainly what we're building into the Sims. We've talked a little bit about that being at the very center of what Battlefield is doing. And of course, with the many hundreds of people who play Apex, that sense of connection and community is important there as well. And so, I do believe as we as we continue to move through this transition and games fulfill motivations and needs of our players beyond play. We will see more hours spent in the context of our broader communities, both playing more, creating more, watching more and connecting more. And our centers we look at the shifts now around broader entertainment, is our industry in particular. And within our industry our franchises in particular will benefit disproportionately as Gen Z and Gen Alpha continue to grow and age up, and fulfill their entertainment needs through interactive games as their first form of entertainment. Sims 4 specifically, again, we're, as we've talked about, we're committed to continually to evolve the Sims 4 experience with over 15 updates in the coming year. And we're already starting to see, new social things come into that new marketplace things come into that, and new user generated content opportunities come into the Sims 4. And the Sims team is committed to continue to evolve that. Beyond that, and not a lot to talk about today, and we'll talk more about this at the earnings Investor Day in September is, we are looking to add to that universe and really build out that community globally. And you should think about that in the context of more social interaction, across the Sims community and more platform expansion, and modality of play expansion. And so, while the teams will continue to advance and expand Sims 4, we will also be adding new experiences that bring deep social connection, and broader platform expansion in key geographies around the world. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Clay Griffin from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Clay Griffin : Thanks for taking the question. This is a follow-up to the conversation on industry. I guess, Andrew, how does your thinking evolved on free to play as a monetization strategy in this HD world versus the multi-modal monetization you've successfully value with EA Sports. I mean, just getting back to this, this topic of industry growth. Do you feel like free to play as at least in some part been dilutive to industry pricing power, or maybe gamer's perception of value? Andrew Wilson : The short answer is no. I mean, free to play games started in Asia, what is probably two decades ago now, or a little more and certainly started to take, form meaningfully in the West probably in the last decade. The industry has continued to grow broadly across both the traditional premium category, and the free to play category. And certainly as you think about mobile coming into that ecosystem that is almost double the industry overall. And that's primarily a free to play mechanic. So as we think about this when you, in the context of building massive online community, certainly right now there's about 3 billion people who consider themselves gamers or players around the world. Many are looking to fulfill different needs and motivations as part of their play experience, depending on what platform and what geography they come from. Our orientation right now is to support all business models. And if you look at our biggest franchises, FC being the biggest of course, we have modalities of play across premium, across free to play, across live service, across console, across PC, across mobile. And that franchise has grown every platform, every modality of play. And across every business model, since we brought that in. So as we think about American Football, as we think about Apex, as we think about Battlefield, as we think about the Sims. Our belief is that if we're building out for a global player base of over 3 billion players, and we're looking to build communities in and around our biggest IP of many hundreds of millions of players. Our ability to utilize free to play as a mechanism, to reach more people on console PC and mobile. And then offer different monetization opportunities, whether that's in small increments, whether that's in battle passes, or whether that's in full premium purchases, that will likely drive meaningful growth, not just the industry, but for our company. Andrew Wilson : So thank you for all - thank you for all being here and for all of your great questions. Again, I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and their commitment in delivering an incredible quarter. And I must add, from College campuses and NFL fields across the U.S., to the hallowed soccer pitches around the world, football is back. This is going to be a big football quarter for us. In my humble opinion, this is the most exciting energizing time of the year for sports fandom. With that, I'll close by saying I'm extremely excited about what our future holds, and look forward to sharing more about our pipeline and longer term strategy to deliver growth - to all of our shareholders at our Investor Day on September 17 in New York City. Thank you for being with us. Operator : That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
