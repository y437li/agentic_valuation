Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the International Paper's First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Wanda, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, given our expanded disclosure around our Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Faraci. John V. Faraci: Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. As we usually do, over the next 15 to 20 minutes, Carol Roberts and I will review our first quarter 2004 (sic) [2014] results and the performance of our individual businesses, then we'll speak to our outlook and we'll open it up to the Q&A session. So let me just start off. International Paper delivered solid operating earnings despite the unusual combination of multiple severe weather events, particularly in the Midwest and Southeast, where a big portion of our mills, box plants and customers are concentrated. The earnings impact due to the weather, which fortunately is now behind us, was $60 million in the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, we also experienced, and this is the positive part, higher prices in many of our global businesses, including Printing Papers in North America, Consumer Packaging, Industrial Packaging in North America, as well as the Paper business in Latin America, particularly Brazil. Despite the significant weather impact, we had strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business, with operating earnings at record levels for the first quarter. We also successfully executed $120 million of mill outages at 13 mills and completed the Courtland closure, and our transitioning activities are progressing. We've entered the final stages of the Courtland closure but not all the costs are behind us but a big chunk of them are. We made a lot of progress on the xpedx spin/merge with Unisource, and we expect to close that transaction around the middle of the year. I'm also pleased to report that the Ilim Joint Venture had a solid quarter operationally, almost 2x, almost double the level of the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp-up of the projects, which involved higher volumes, improved productivity, better quality and lower costs. We also got some pulp price increases. These gains, however, were masked by a negative $0.10 noncash charge associated with the devaluation of the ruble during the quarter against the joint venture's U.S. dollar denominated debt. I think the progress on the Ilim ramp-up just underscores International Paper's capability to operate and run global businesses that are in our core business space. And finally, we continue to make progress with our share buyback program in the quarter, and I'll discuss those results a little later on the call. So continuing with our financial results, EBITDA was $920 million for the quarter, down slightly from last year. But remember, weather was $60 million of that. We also had $40 million of cash costs associated with the Courtland closure. Free cash flow was $254 million. But I think to really compare that to the first quarter of $300 million last year, you need to do 2 things : take the weather impact of $60 million, the $40 million cash costs for Courtland and the $60 million higher CapEx that we had in the first quarter that's planned, and our underlying free cash flow was closer to $380 million, but we showed $250 million here for those other 3 reasons. So let me turn it over to Carol Roberts now to talk about the business performance. Carol L. Roberts: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the sequential EPS bridge, IP earned $0.61 per share in the first quarter versus $0.83 in the fourth quarter. As you can see, on the bridge, the $60 million weather impact is on the far right. And as you think about that impact, it's about 50% operational disruption with higher costs associated with that, 25% lost volume and 25% higher input costs in the quarter. Outside of the weather impact, as John mentioned, we experienced favorable pricing. We did see seasonally weaker volume, we had good operation, and the impact of the heavier maintenance outages hit us in this quarter. Additionally, we saw other increased input costs, a negative swing on corporate due to the non-repeat of the favorable item from the fourth quarter and the net unfavorable change in equity earnings at Ilim due to the noncash FX impact, as John described earlier. I think it's important, turning to the next slide, to put a little context around our results for the first quarter of '14 versus the first quarter of '13. When you compare our year-over-year results, the first quarter of '14 was a strong quarter, considering we had the impact of the weather, a higher tax rate and the unfavorable noncash Ilim FX impact of $0.08. And additionally, if you look into the ops line, $0.05 of the year-over-year impact was attributable to the Courtland shutdown cost. So when you put all that together, those items represent $0.32 per share headwind in the quarter year-over-year. Turning to the next slide. This shows our quarter-over-quarter global input costs impact. As you can see, we experienced significant headwinds, largely driven by the extreme weather condition across much of the U.S. This drove energy costs much higher. And those costs, although seasonally improving, will remain relatively high as we work through the second quarter. We do anticipate that the gas market is going to [ph] albeit slowly due to the current pretty low level of gas inventories that exist right now. We experienced seasonal wood cost increases as well. In addition to the weather impact, our wood costs are currently being unfavorably impacted by competition for fiber from OSB plant start-ups and some new export pallet facility. Although we do expect some improvement in North America wood costs throughout the year, we do expect the wood demand environment to remain under some pressure over the next couple of quarters. Now turning to the businesses on Slide 10. Let me talk about Industrial Packaging. As John mentioned, the Industrial Packaging business had a strong quarter, driven by increased prices, favorable mix and stronger sequential volume in North America. Our year-over-year box volume was down about 2% on a per day basis, and this is roughly in line with the industry. Outside of the weather impact, the operations performed well and the business successfully executed $69 million of outages. Wood and seasonally higher energy costs were partially offset by favorable OCC costs. In addition to our planned maintenance outages, the business did take 60,000 tons of market-related downtime in the quarter, as we continue to match our supply with our customers' demand. Looking at the EBITDA margins in North American Industrial Packaging on Slide 11. The business continues to generate the best margins in the industry, and Mark Sutton and his team are actively working initiatives across the business, which will drive further margin expansion over time. Before leaving Industrial Packaging, I wanted to touch on what we're seeing on the demand front through April. As you can see on this slide, month-to-date, April '14 shipments are up about 3% from the first quarter level and, importantly, are up 2% versus April of '13. While this comparison only considers what we've seen so far this quarter, there's no doubt that demand has certainly picked up from the Q1 level and particularly has picked up from the March level. This is from the recovery -- from the weather, of course, but also as we move into a seasonally stronger time of year. Moving on to Consumer Packaging on Slide 13. We exited the quarter with price momentum as we continue to implement our recently announced increases. I have to note for this quarter, volume was constrained by a 5-year coal mill outage in Augusta. We did see sequentially softer demand around Chinese New Year in our Sun JV, and we had a significant outage, a positive outage, at our coated paperboard machine at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill as we did a significant capital project to enhance our product quality. Other significant factors impacting Brazil were escalating input costs, disruptions due to the severe weather and just consistency of our manufacturing operations. In the other category, which shows up on the bridge, that's primarily FX and driven by the weakening currency in China. I think it's important for our Consumer Packaging business to highlight a lot of the positive momentum that may be masked in the previous bridge. That's going to result in the business having improved earnings in the second half of the year and beyond. It's important to note that 85% of our mill outages in the U.S. business will take place in the first 5 months of the year. We know that North American SBS backlogs remain strong at 5 weeks, and we anticipate that will continue given the high outage schedule that I just mentioned. We saw record cup demand in the Q1 despite January and February's weather in much of the U.S. And we expect full realization of the announced price increases in both our Coated Paperboard and Foodservice grade in this business. Real good news is we're continuing to see the positive momentum in the shift from foam to paper cups, and that's going to benefit both our Coated Paperboard and Foodservice businesses. To ensure that we have the capacity to take advantage of this growing demand, we recently announced the expansion of our Kenton, Ohio facility, which we will complete by mid-next year. And finally, which is very exciting, is we recently very successfully completed a significant capital project to our Bleached Board machine in Kwidzyn, Poland, and we will realize the benefits from enhanced product quality and expanded margin, as we ramp up and bring this new product to market over the next year. On Slide 15, let me move on to Printing Papers. In Printing Papers, we saw price improvement in North America and Brazil, along with mix improvement as we exited lower-price positions as part of the Courtland transition. But these were more than offset by lower volumes in North America, Brazil and Europe. The North American volumes were lower, of course, due to the Courtland shutdown. And for Brazil, the first quarter is just a seasonally slower quarter. I'd want to note that volume and mix were adversely impacted by a slowing Russian economy. And consequently there, we saw an increase in our export shipment. We do expect this trend to continue into the second quarter. The higher costs that show up on the bridge are essentially result of the Courtland shutdown. Higher inputs, namely wood and energy, unfavorable FX in Brazil and weather, were also negative to the quarter. We realized $36 per ton in price improvement across all the grades in North American paper, and that's slightly ahead of expectations on a weighted average basis as that first price increase was applied to about 75% to 80% of our mix. Turning specifically to an update on the Courtland shutdown on Slide 16. Things are progressing well, and we're entering the final stages of the shutdown and transition. All production was ceased in the first quarter, and we're currently depleting all the transition inventory. Really important work on the qualification trials for the retained business is nearing completion. I want to take a moment on behalf of the entire senior leadership team at the company to thank all our colleagues at the Courtland mill and across the North American Printing Papers business who've been involved with this really massive undertaking for a tough job that was done very well. I'm happy to report that a significant number of our Courtland colleagues have found employment opportunities. Many of which were in other International Paper facilities, where we had openings and opportunities. As we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, we are incurring closure and transition costs as part of this initiative. The impact on operating results in the first quarter was close to $30 million. We expect costs in the second quarter to be about half that, and then there will be some residual and transition costs that flow into the third and fourth quarters, and they'll be in the range of about $5 million to $10 million per quarter. Moving on to distribution. Distribution did experience a challenging quarter as supply chain disruption due to the weather challenges certainly impacted operations and revenue. Lower costs did help our margin, but these benefits were more than offset by the weaker sales. And as John mentioned, we're making very good progress with the activities related to completing the spin/merge transaction with Unisource. Moving on to the Ilim Joint Venture. As John mentioned, the Ilim Joint Venture had a very solid quarter of progress, with $115 million of operational EBITDA, and that improvement was driven by better operations, better productivity, which led to higher volume, and increased pulp prices. On IP's equity earnings though, we were negatively impacted by the weakening ruble during the quarter and the resulting noncash FX impact on the JV's U.S. denominated debt. The JV saw its operational EBITDA, as John said, increase by $54 million in the first quarter, and that just shows the very significant progress we're making on the ramp-up of our projects. While the JV expect operational performance to continue to improve, we have seen some decline in pulp prices from first quarter levels, and that will modestly impact second quarter results unfavorably. And while the Russian economy has slowed considerably, that will impact our Paper business to the West. It is important to note that all of -- much of our production, a majority of our production in the East is destined for China, and the China pulp demand for this business remains strong. Turning to Slide 19. I wanted to take a moment to give you an update on the 2 significant capital projects at the Ilim JV. On the left is the Bratsk mill and on the right is the Koryazhma mill that houses PM-7 that we've started up. The bar graphs represent the recent production ramp-up trends for each. So if I look at Bratsk, you can see that production continues to ramp up. And to put a number on this, we're showing that representing 30% increase in output from the fourth quarter of '13 to our outlook for the second quarter of '14. And the JV expects to achieve full production targets on the new fiber line by year end. In the case of the paper machine at Koryazhma, the machine actually achieved full production and qualification on our uncoated freesheet grades in March. So great progress at the JV and more to come as the year unfolds. So before turning it back to John, let me move to Slide 20 and give you an outlook into the second quarter. I want to note that at the bottom, we added a line on the chart to account for the first quarter weather impact, which is $60 million across our North American business. And remember, this includes some volume, the operational impacts and the input costs escalation that occurred in the first quarter. Outside of that broad weather impact, which included the items I just mentioned, we expect volume to increase in North American Industrial Packaging by an incremental 1.5% to 2.5%. Volume should also modestly improve the North American Consumer Packaging and in Brazil packaging. Given the economic slowdown in Russia, we do expect some modest unfavorable volume and price/mix impacts for the Paper business in that part of the world. Paper pricing/mix will continue to improve in North America and to some extent in Brazil. We should also see the benefit of higher pricing in fluff pulp. We will see some favorable pricing in North American Consumer Packaging as we implement our announced price increase. With the increase in volume in North American Industrial Packaging that comes from a ramp-up of some of the consumer packaged goods companies, we could and will likely see some modest offset as our customer mix normalize. And we do expect to see improvement in prices in our Brazil Packaging business. Operations should continue to perform solidly, and we'll see the benefit of lower shutdown costs at Courtland, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of the weather, we expect overall input costs to be relatively stable with some puts and takes, with some pressure on wood prices, a slight headwind in our European business. The second quarter is our heaviest maintenance outage quarter, with outage costs up $60 million versus the first quarter. And finally, on the Ilim JV, we expect solid operational performance to continue. However, pulp prices are -- declined slightly from the first quarter, and we do have some planned maintenance outage in the quarter. As always, for the purposes of this exercise, we're assuming no change in FX, so a non-recurrence of that impact that we saw in the first quarter is planned for the second. So with that as an outlook for the second quarter, John, let me turn it back to you. John V. Faraci: Thanks, Carol, and I'm on, I believe, Slide 21. Let me just summarize the major puts and takes as we move to the second quarter. Severe weather is behind us, and we've moved on. We see in April increased volume, particularly in our Industrial Packaging business. We think that's both seasonal improvement but also related to some economic activity, which is a good sign. Price realization in boxes is solid and with year-over-year sequential box volume up. We've got a number of pricing initiatives underway in coated paperboard, fluff pulp, North American paper, and we expect to see those benefits in the second quarter, balance of the year. The Courtland shutdown, as both Carol and I talked about, is nearly complete and the costs will be coming down, but we still got some costs with us. We're going to experience our heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year, up $60 million from Q1. Our tax rate should be up from first quarter levels to roughly 32% for the year, assuming no major changes. But if extenders get passed, that will be lower. Interest expense benefit we had in the first quarter won't repeat. But all-in, we expect a stronger earnings quarter ahead of this Q2. Let me shift gears here for a minute to step back and comment about what IP is doing with our cash. Previously, we talked about IP as a cash flow story. We're running our businesses well, generating higher levels of sustainable free cash flow. We're consistently generating returns for the company above our cost of capital. We work hard to strengthen the balance sheet. We've got $2.5 billion of debt since early 2012, and we met our leverage targets. We've returned more cash to shareholders, increasing the dividend in each of the last 2 fourth quarters, as you see here on this slide. And we've been executing our share buyback authorization since initiating that last September. Simply put, we've done what we said we would do. In terms of the dividend, you can see the recent history where we've made meaningful increases over the last couple of years. We've increased the dividend by more than 33% since outlining our plan in mid-2012, moving the dividend from $1.05 per share to $1.20 in the fourth quarter 2012, then to a $1.40 in the fourth quarter 2013. Very clear, we're saying we think there's more dividend runway ahead, and we continue to increase dividend as free cash flow grows, periodically, systematically, thoughtfully, and importantly, sustainably. Our target of 30% to 40% in free cash flow reflects really a trough-tested analysis of -- that we did because we intend, whatever level we get the dividend to, to make it sustainable. And that 30% to 40% of our free cash flow, which we outlined to many of you at Investor Day a couple of years ago really has dividend potential to grow the dividend to $1.60 to $2 a share. A quick update on the share buyback program. We've continued to be in the marketplace. Since our fourth quarter call, we've purchased over $460 million of stock since our call on February 4 at an average price of roughly $46. This brings total authorization -- total purchases within our $1.5 billion authorization to nearly $1 billion in less than 8 months. And as I said before, with this authorization, we continue to take advantage of the opportunity to buy back larger amounts of stock when the price is attractive relative to our view of intrinsic value. So let me just wrap up by concluding, what makes IP different. I'm not going to read this final slide here, but I think it highlights what IP does that does make IP different and enables us to generate strong free cash flow in today's economic environment, and at the same time, earn above cost of capital returns. The economy is improving, albeit slowly, and that's going to help everybody. But the good news for International Paper and our shareowners is that we have plenty of things to work on that will provide upside from where we sit today, both in North America and in key markets around the globe. So with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Open it up right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It's good to see volumes in containerboard bounce back in April. What are you expecting for volume growth for the balance of the year? John V. Faraci: In containerboard? Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : That's right, in containerboard. John V. Faraci: Mark, do you want to take that? Mark Stephan Sutton : Sure. Philip, we started this year thinking we'll be looking at about a 1% demand environment in box, and that's just using our analysis around nondurable goods production. Of course, the first quarter didn't start out that way. But with a more normal trend of economic activity, that's still a number, we think, is achievable for the balance of the year, but it will all depend, really, and all driven by production in non-durable goods in the U.S. But April is only 1 month in the quarter, but we are seeing some underlying positive trends in customers and segments that really took a beating in the first quarter. John V. Faraci: When I saw the GDP numbers that came out this morning for the first quarter, I wasn't surprised by what our box demand was. We were down 2 and GDP was basically flat. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got you. That's helpful. And then based on your demand outlook, how do you feel about inventory? And do you guys need to take any economic downtime going forward? Mark Stephan Sutton : Well, we don't forecast the economic downtime given the cycle of the business, but our inventories are in pretty good shape. You noticed this is one of the first first quarters in the last couple of years that we weren't talking about a lot of supply chain costs and disruptions in the first quarter, largely related to our inventory position. So we feel good about our inventories. We're going to, obviously, make the containerboard we need to serve the 3 channels that we' re in : our Box business that IP owns and runs first and then our domestic open market and exports. So I think we'll balance what we need in production. We've got a large, flexible system, and I think lack of supply chain issues indicate we've got a pretty healthy quantity of inventory, and the quality of our inventory is in good shape. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got you. And just let me sneak one more in for Carol. The potential dividend target you guys outlined, how quickly can we get to that midpoint? Is that a 2014 event? Is that more of a '14 or 2015 event? Carol L. Roberts: Philip, we've said that as we watch the free cash flow of the company improve and we watch the business results come in, we'll evaluate it. I would say that you've seen us raise it in the fourth quarter of '12 and the fourth quarter of '13. So that's been the fact pattern so far. John V. Faraci: Think incremental and periodic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : One on OCC. John, obviously many people have talked about their expectation that OCC prices would -- are biased upward over the long-term. But obviously, that hasn't happened over the past couple of years. Has there been anything over the past couple of years that you consider anomalous, such that OCC should go up from here? And how much depends on China? John V. Faraci: Well, a lot depends on China. And at the end of the day, China on the pulp side, China is 100% of the world's incremental demand. And you could make an argument, it's probably pretty close to that in terms of incremental OCC demand. There's no question, China is going to elect more of their own OCC because their domestic box -- their box business to domestic market is growing as opposed to box business for export. But remember, China is close to a $50 million ton market. So if it's growing at 4% a year, that's 2 million tons a year, and China is fiber short. So it's almost -- it's hard to come to a conclusion. OCC prices don't trend up over time, with the biggest box market in the world being basically fiber short and recycled linerboard driven. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And just one on the additional capacity in containerboard. How would you characterize the impact so far of the converted newsprint machines and of the new mills? And what do you expect the impact to be of the capacity that's been announced that has yet to hit the market but will do so later this year and into next year? Mark Stephan Sutton : Adam, this is Mark Sutton. On the new capacity that's actually running, our view is the products that are being made are not all the same. They have different end uses. And in our own experience, given we're largely integrated and we export twice as much containerboard as we sell domestically, the impact directly to us has been pretty minimal. However, I think there are secondary impacts in the export market. If our market grows, as we expect it to, modestly, there should be a market to support some capacity additions. It's hard to tell how that's going to play out in the future given the range of quality that -- and capability of these products, but we're keeping an eye on it. It's hard, real hard to speculate on capacity that's being talked about but not yet here. So we're just monitoring that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Just a couple of quickies. First of all, on Ilim, just to try and calibrate the model, absent the FX hit, should we see kind of low double-digit contribution, perhaps even low teens in the first quarter? John V. Faraci: In terms of EPS? Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Yes. Well, in terms of the line item swinging from, I think, a loss of $31 million back towards $10 million to $15 million positive? Carol L. Roberts: I think the way to look at that would be to take the FX out and that operational EBITDA that we mentioned of the $115 million. While we see good momentum on the production of the 2 projects in the mills, we see a little pressure on pulp pricing. And we have an outage that we'll take at the end of the quarter. So I would expect that we would see operational EBITDA to be down a bit from that first quarter level. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay. And I recognized that the sanctions are against individuals in Russia as opposed to corporations. Are you concerned? Or do you have any contingency plans if things get worse? John V. Faraci: Well, at this point in time, Steve, business conditions aren't worse as it relates to what's going on in the Ukraine. Actually, the weakening ruble is helping us in our competitive position because we have so much pulp we export to China. And as paper -- the Russian economy was slowing going into the fourth quarter. There's no question, it slowed a little more because of what's going on in Eastern Europe and in the Ukraine but the weaker ruble is also helping us on our paper exports because of the ramp-up of that paper machine in Ilim combined with the paper machine we have in IP Russia. We're exporting more paper out of Russia, and the market and the currency is helping us. We've got contingency plans. We've taken on quite a bit of debt to fund those products, but not all of that is long-term debt, and we have good contingency plans in place to roll over that debt regardless of what happens in the financial market. So like every other business, we're watching the situation closely. And with people on the ground over there, we're getting input from people on the ground as to what's happening and also kind of following the news here. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Great. And just on the containerboard inventories, every company seems to be comfortable with their levels. Yet collectively, they seem kind of high. Should we recalibrate our concern threshold? Mark Stephan Sutton : Well, I think that's possible. I think when you look at the way that you can really leverage a well-run supply chain in these containerboard systems, and I only know ours. Managing to some arbitrary numbered inventory can actually cost you a lot more money. So I think that's something we are looking at, what's the best inventory for what we need. And then again, I've mentioned this before, not only is our demand seasonal, but our capacity is seasonal, largely through our maintenance outages. So that's not exactly the same every year. So we've got to prepare through inventories to get through maintenance outages. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : On the last call, I think you guided to 10% improvement and full year EBITDA and free cash flow of roughly $2 billion. And apologies if I missed this, but is that still intact given the weather hit that you experienced in 1Q? Or are there kind of big moving pieces that impact that guidance as we're 1 quarter through the year? John V. Faraci: Well, we said approximately -- we said a significant improvement in EBITDA, approximately 10%. There's no question we're starting off with a $60 million hole. But we still see the year's shaping up with strong free cash flow and a meaningful improvement in EBITDA. And we've got some tailwinds we can create and I think if we continue to see the April box data as beginning of a trend, that's a positive sign. So we've got no reason at this point to change what we said on that last call. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to Brazil. In the quarter, you increased your stake in Orsa and market conditions in Brazil have been a little bit soft. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the progress that you've seen internally at Orsa, the expected growth in margins that you hope to achieve in 2014, 2015 and just generally the market conditions there. There's been some talk about maybe power rationing, is that something that potentially could impact you or your customers? Or any thoughts you have there? Timothy S. Nicholls: It's Tim. Well, just -- let's start with the last piece on energy. Energy costs are up, primarily because the -- Brazil, the whole country, is living through, for the industrialized parts, pretty significant drought at the moment. So we're taking steps to mitigate any risk we might have around operational performance both on the paper side and the packaging side. But we don't know what the weather is going to do, so it's kind of a week-by-week situation. In terms of Orsa, we had a disappointing quarter. Volume was lighter than we expected it to be. The good news is it was isolated around a handful of customers that are experiencing their own challenges in the market. We've taken steps and are taking steps to replace that volume. And we saw a continuation of OCC going up. So margins are not where we want it to be in the first quarter, which includes December through the February period because we report on a 1-month lag. The good news is that's the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, and we're expecting a significant improvement in results as we go into the second quarter. So we don't forecast earnings. But I've stated before, we think we can get the business into the mid-20s for EBITDA margins, and I still think that's true. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a question on North American paper price realizations. I think, Carol, you mentioned $36 a ton on your commentary. I'm just taking a look at Slide 43 in your deck, and there's a $56 a ton quarter-over-quarter change. Just wondering which ones -- which one is which. Or is there a difference between the 2. Timothy S. Nicholls: It's Tim again. Actually, they're both correct. On the slide that you're looking at, we did average to average realize $56 a ton. We think about $20 of that was mix. And so when we look at the first price increase across all of our tonnage, you have to keep in mind that the announced price increase from the fall was only about -- on about 75% to 80% of our volume. And we think we've got a fairly normal realization on that. So it was $36 average to average. We actually exited the quarter $3 or $4 above that. So we felt pretty good about how we wrapped up the first price increase. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So essentially, that $36 of the first price increase and then the extra $20 comes from your mix? Timothy S. Nicholls: Right. We've got $36 average to average. We actually exited in the quarter $3 to $4 above that. So probably $39, $40 a ton across all the tons. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just over on Bratsk. I mean, I like the 30% improvement from Q4 to forecasted Q2 '14. But what's the current operating rate? Or what was the operating rate for Bratsk in Q1 of '14? John V. Faraci: We came out on the new pulp line at about 1,400 tons a day, which is about 70% of capacity. And the -- Carol talked about the outage we have coming into second quarter -- late second quarter will enable us to take the next big step and get that closer to design levels, as we go into third and fourth quarters. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : What's the current bottleneck at that mill? John V. Faraci: Pardon me? Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : What's the current bottleneck or where is the... John V. Faraci: We've got a couple of cases to make on equipment. There's no major bottleneck, like with any biggest softwood pulp line in the world, biggest continuous digester and we've got to go and do some not significant modification, the vendor is going to do for us. Don't worry about the Bratsk because we can sell all we can make. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : John, in the U.S. Containerboard business in the first quarter, your volumes were down 2%, the industry was flat, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples. And I think we had talked about in previous quarters that your volume should be more consistent with the industry numbers going forward. So maybe just for the first quarter, can you talk about what was different for you versus the industry? And then going forward, how do you see your performance versus the industry in the volume side? Mark Stephan Sutton : Alex, this is Mark. The industry was actually down about 1.6%. We were down 2%. So we were roughly in line with the industry on a comparable basis. And we still believe, and we stated this before, we should and we plan to try to grow with the market. That's the type of customers we have, the segments we participate in with a broad-based business. And our expectation is, over the long term, to grow at the market rate. And we were relatively close to that in the first quarter. We've narrowed the gap. From about 1.5 year ago, we were as much as 300 to 400 basis points behind the market. We talked about why and we've consistently narrowed that gap to the point where we're very close now. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So my mistake, the 2% was on a per day basis, that absolute. Okay, that clears it up. And then on the optimization in containerboard in the U.S., we talked about previously, I think, a potential $100 million per year over the next couple of years. Can you just update us how you guys perform in the first quarter? I'm assuming it was probably challenging given the weather. And sort of how do you see yourself being able to perform relative to the $100 million target as we move through 2014? Mark Stephan Sutton : We -- you're right, it was challenging in the first quarter. A lot of the optimization items we've highlighted are internal improvements, not really market improvements. And that is in supply chain and how we run our manufacturing operations. There's a couple areas I'd point to. John mentioned one of them, I think, earlier. In our converting facilities, in our Box business, we ran very well. We not only had a record first quarter in earnings but we had a best-ever performance in waste, the performance in our converting operations. And our supply chain across a number of metrics, how we use transportation, how we spend money, moving our product from our mills to our box plants, making sure we're making product in the right mill for the right end location, all improved in the quarter. So I think we made a good step. Obviously, the interruptions in the first part of the quarter made it more difficult. John V. Faraci: I think the optimization is we're driving a racecar on the track, and the more laps we get around the track, the better the racecar gets. And that's really what optimizing the business is all about. It's a brand-new business for us, 3x the size it was 5 years ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to dig into your comments a little bit on the April containerboard volumes. You mentioned some pickup in underlying customers and end markets. Can you talk about a little bit more specifically what types of customers are we talking about? And which end markets you're seeing recovery in? Mark Stephan Sutton : I would say, in general, given the month is just ending today, I think 2 things, I would say. In customers, it's broad based, but it's mostly in the customers that were most impacted in the first quarter. So you would think about the large consumer packaged goods companies that took maybe a disproportionate hit based on the type of products they sell and where they're located. And then I would say, geographically, we're seeing a broad-based improvement from March, especially. No single place. A lot of what we're seeing is with existing customers. Obviously, you don't win business in a 30-day period, necessarily. So a lot of it is with existing customers that we were off with in the first quarter, and we're regaining with those customers. But I would say across the board, segment and geography. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then within Industrial Packaging, you noted on Slide 38 that European container was actually up 2% year-over-year. Looks pretty strong to me. But how is that versus your expectations? Are you seeing some acceleration in the economy over there? What is sort of the underlying trends there? John V. Faraci: Think of our European Box business having 2 pieces. There's Turkey and Morocco. Both countries are -- had good volume growth. Morocco was the strongest country in the European Box portfolio last year, principally driven by fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. And then we get to, France, Italy, Spain business. And frankly, volumes, and I think consistent with Western Europe coming out of a slump later than the U.S. did, is starting to -- I wouldn't say is sharply growing, but it's coming back to life. And so we're seeing some better box activity, particularly in the industrial segments. And so our box volume was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. We expect it to have a rebound year-over-year, and good news is we're seeing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Just, I guess, question for Tim on just the Uncoated Freesheet business, how -- in North America, how you're feeling about the second price hike at this juncture. And any concern with some of the import -- additional import activity at Staples at this point? Timothy S. Nicholls: Well, to be honest, we've lost a little bit of position due to imports on cut size. We'll see how long that holds up. There's a few things you need to know about imports, at least the way we think about it. First, they fluctuate dramatically over various periods of time and it's really driven by FX and by supply chain logistics costs. There's a pretty long pipeline to supply from 1 region of the world to another and not without disruption. But the other thing on imports, even though we've seen significant growth coming into North America in the first quarter, our belief is not all of that is staying in North America. Because of the way the reporting is done, we see it coming in. You don't see it going back out. And we believe that a portion of what's come in has come in for the purpose of redistribution back out to Central and South America. So we don't think it's to the degree that the reported numbers state. In terms of the business going forward, it's difficult to predict demand. But first quarter was no doubt soft, especially in the January time frame, and we think in part due to weather. So the good news was that it improved all the way through the quarter, and we exited March from a demand standpoint to a better place than we started for sure, and April looks okay so far. John V. Faraci: With Mark on the work, we're not using a lot of copy [ph] paper. Mark Stephan Sutton : No. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Okay. And I think the volumes you indicated were down, I think, 19% overall. Can you give us a sense or flavor sort of how that parsed out domestically versus exports? I imagine export was significantly a big driver of that. And then in addition, I know part of the strategy with Courtland was to improve the mix, and sort of where you are on that. You mentioned the transitional costs there. But are we still very early in the process for mix improvement in that business that we should see improvement in the coming quarters as well? Timothy S. Nicholls: As we talked about just a minute ago, we realized $56 per ton of average price realization and incremental increase in price quarter-to-quarter. And about $20 of that, we think, was mix. So it's not a precise science, but we think that's a good number. What was the other part of your question? I'm sorry. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : I was just wondering if that -- if there's additional mix improvement that we should see beyond just what we saw in the first quarter? Timothy S. Nicholls: Well, some of the mix improvement would be driven by seasonality. So there could be some, especially as we get into the stronger season of Q2 and in latter summer and the first part of the fourth quarter. The August, September, October time frame is generally a strong seasonal period as well. And some of the cut size promotions that we have run around either tax season or back-to-school. So I'd say what you should take away from it is, we feel like we're on track to the mix improvement that we wanted to get. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Maybe going back to OCC question, given that it's driven by China, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Chinese Box business? And also, I guess, as someone who buys a fair amount of board in China, when you look at the quality of the board you're buying, do you have any sense if there's been a change in the mix of where OCC in China is coming from, more domestic, et cetera? Thomas Gustave Kadien : Gail, it's Tom Kadien. I guess, to the latter part, we buy probably a dozen different grades of different kinds of test liner. So we wouldn't see a change in the quality of what we're buying based on, I'll call it, the mix of domestic versus imported OCC. Now that said, the Chinese -- our view on it, the box demand was flat to down. Export kind of oriented Box business in China is off. If you look at the Chinese economic data, exports were down double digits in February. They were down high single digits in March. So the export-oriented Box business is down. Domestic is growing. But not fast enough to make up for the export. So it's a pretty soft market. Chinese New Year was pretty slow coming out of that, and the first quarter box demand was certainly not what we'd hope for. Now we have seen an improvement, I would say, in the month of April. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And maybe just, again, international box. Last quarter, you talked about perhaps a bit of a struggle to pass through price increases on board into box. With some of the recycle prices in Europe falling over, has that become kind of a nonevent and not even a question at this point? Or are you still expecting to get some box price improvement over there? John V. Faraci: Well, there's been some slippage in board prices, and that's helping us on our, we call, delta P. But it's still very competitive market in the marketplace for boxes. So we haven't gotten a much price lift at all, but we are getting some relief on the buy side because we're a net buyer of all of our board over there. And some of it does come from the U.S. on the virgin side. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And if I can maybe just throw in one last quick one, staying on international boxes, just the overall export market for your U.S. board. Mark Stephan Sutton : Gail, the U.S. board that we export, I would say that I characterize the market on volume as stable. And we are not seeing any significant changes in the demand pattern in the major markets that we serve, including the board that goes through our own IP box plants. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And pricing? John V. Faraci: Pricing, I'd say, is also stable. It will show in the data chart down quarter-over-quarter, but that's partly because of the way we entered the fourth quarter. But we've seen some recovery in isolated markets. But overall, I'd say it's a stable environment for the board we export, which is kraft linerboard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Looking at the uncoated freesheet situation. I know in the past, sometimes when we see a price increase announced, we wouldn't actually see the full amount, maybe it was sort of some customers will pay the full amount, but some might not. And as we think about the second round of increases of $50 to $70, could you just clarify what percentage of your mix in North America or the U.S. is subject to that? And is it your intention to pretty much show the full amount eventually, I guess, by the third or fourth quarter? Timothy S. Nicholls: Chip, it's Tim. It affects roughly 85% -- depending on how mix plays out, 85% to 90% of our volume. What I would say about the second increase, we've had all of the conversations for the most part that we need to have with customers and we've settled all of those discussions. So what you're going to see is price increase will play out through the second quarter. And there's probably going to be a little bit that bleeds over to the first part of the third. But I think we don't forecast price, so -- but that's how I see it playing out. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then as we -- shifting gears a little bit, when we look at sort of the containerboard market in North America -- well, the Box business, I'm sorry, in April, you mentioned that was up year-over-year after being down in the first quarter. And one of your competitors was sort of suggesting it might not be up for them. Do you think some of what you're seeing is share gain? Or maybe asked differently, could it also involve maybe some catch-up with the first quarter issues? Or do you think there might be something more underlying going on in the marketplace? Mark Stephan Sutton : Chip, this is Mark. What I'd mentioned earlier is what we're seeing mainly in our business is rebounding with existing customers. In that short of a period of time, not a whole lot of business changes hands in terms of share. So it's really -- I think part of it a snapback and part of it underlying economic improvement. But the majority of what we see is in our existing customer base. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Question on use of capital. In particular, given the last 5 or 6 years, it seems a lot of evidence, there's reduced volatility in your cash flows, much more stability. Does that incline you potentially to move to the top end of that 30% to 40% return through dividend range? Carol L. Roberts: No. I think, Mark, that's an excellent point. We do view that our business is definitely less cyclical. And I think that view that it's less cyclical is also what's driven to the stable cash flows, the stable cash flows then lead to the dividend view of 30% to 40%. So I think they're all tied together. And I think, certainly, we feel that cash flow is sustainable and we feel that those targets are appropriate, and we'll just keep monitoring and pushing it. And I think John laid out a pretty clear number of that $1.60 to $2. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. And then on the same topic, you noted in the Slide 25, John spoke to, under the global -- it says leveraging global platform for profitable growth. And John, you also made an allusion to Ilim working out pretty well here and increased confidence in your ability to make core businesses successful overseas. Is that signaling a little increase in desire to seek out global growth? Or is it more kind of a reference to Orsa, the acquisition there? I'm just trying to read what -- whether there's a little bit of enhanced conviction on growing overseas or not? John V. Faraci: Don't read anything into it, Mark, other than we're doing what we said we would do. And we spent $1.5 billion in Russia on big capital projects, not in our balance sheet, but on the Ilim balance sheet. And we're starting to deliver the results. I mean, we've gone through -- those projects are very complicated, very difficult, took longer than we thought. And we're going to start to see the benefits from those come through. And we'll get the same thing on Orsa. Tim said, we're a little bit behind there. But if we know anything, it's not around Industrial Packaging business, just about anywhere, and we'll get it right in Brazil. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I know we're late here. Two things : One on North America and then the other one on Orsa for Tim. In North American Industrial Packaging, if you look at the controllable factors, obviously the weather had an effect in your ability to analyze this. Where do you ultimately think you did better? Because from our vantage point, you had a very solid quarter versus our model. It sounded like it came more from converting relative to the mills. But could you confirm that? The related question, good managements that had a lot of experience in their businesses know how to adapt given market conditions. Certainly, you had a big curveball in terms of the weather. Were there any levers that you pulled in the first quarter that might have been pulled more in the second quarter from the optimization standpoint that means that sequentially or later in the year, you don't have quite the same pickup? And then a question for Tim, on Orsa, recognizing that you are confident in your ability to improve the margin to your target goal, what gives you the most conviction in getting that goal, Tim, in the next couple of years? Mark Stephan Sutton : George, on the first part for North American Industrial Packaging, I think the way -- you're right, it's hard to analyze the quarter in terms of what went well or better than -- I'm not sure what was in the model, what went better than you might have expected. But your comment about converting, we definitely ran our Converting business very well, and we expected to as we've been optimizing and moving business around, and it's bearing fruit and on a number of fronts. On the cost side, on the service to customers, in both cases. And I think other than the early start to the quarter, where we did have some couple of our mills got into some freeze issues, we ran very well in our mill system, which is a big part of our optimization plan. It only takes a couple of our large mills to have a problem to kind of show you a poor average. But on a 17 mills or 16 mills in the U.S., we ran very well at most of them. So I think it was across mills and converting. As far as the levers on optimization, I wouldn't say we pulled anything in the first quarter that we took from another quarter. It was a lot of blocking and tackling and executing in the supply chain and how we run our mills from a reliability standpoint and in the choices we made relative to some of the action in response to what was happening on demand. And we took some economic downtime, and partly because of that demand environment not being where we thought it was. And we have a pretty sophisticated model of how to do that and do it at the lowest marginal cost. And we're getting better at that each quarter. And we're not done. We're still improving that process. Timothy S. Nicholls: George, it's Tim. Just on Orsa around the conviction on the margins. As John said, we have a lot of experience around Industrial Packaging businesses, and we're taking full advantage of that and leveraging that know-how across the business. But just locally, it's a market we know, it's a market that we believe in long term, and we've got a lot of talent there. So getting the right talent in the right spots is a critical part of our success. Lastly, we like our customer base. We think we're aligned with a really good set of customers and have been for a long time. We had a couple of customers who struggled in their own markets in the first quarter, and they'll probably struggle as we go through part of this year. But overall, I think people, we've got a lot of cost improvement opportunities and we've got a great customer base. John V. Faraci: I think we're done and just for me to say -- to wrap it up. We continue to see this year shaping up as a good one for International Paper with a meaningful improvement in EBITDA and with strong free cash flow. We look forward in giving you a further update on that when we report our second quarter results late July. Thank you. Jay Royalty : So thanks, John, and thanks, again, to all of you for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call, and our phone numbers are on Slide 26 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Patrick, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Jay Royalty, to begin the conference. Jay? Jay Royalty : Thanks a lot, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are John Faraci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, Slide 4 provides context around the Ilim joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Faraci. John V. Faraci: Thanks, Jay, and good morning to everybody. As we normally do, Carol and I are going to review the second quarter 2014 results and the performance of individual businesses, then we'll speak to the third quarter outlook and open it up for your questions. So I'm going to start them on Slide 5. International Paper delivered strong earnings performance in the second quarter, driven by very strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and solid performance around the globe in other key businesses. Our North American businesses saw an expected recovery from a weather-impacted first quarter, but we also continued to have higher-than-expected input costs. Additionally, we successfully executed almost $200 million of maintenance outages across the enterprise and, importantly, we didn't let that get in the way of continuing to operate in a very solid fashion. Ilim continues to be a good news story, with solid operational EBITDA attributable to benefits from the continued improvement at both projects, Koryazhma and Bratsk. And despite some softness in the pulp markets in the second quarter, the joint venture also had a favorable FX gain as the ruble strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Think of that as a reversal from the opposite we had in the first quarter. In early July, IP's Board of Directors approved an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which extends the program implemented last September, and Carol's going to update you on second quarter activity a little bit later on in the presentation. On the people front. We announced the appointment of Mark Sutton as President and Chief Operating Officer of International Paper on January 1. The board and I are very pleased to have Mark in that role. He's an experienced global leader and operator, knows IP and the industry well. He's with us here in the room today and will participate in the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, we completed the xpedx transaction on July 1, as IP spun off our North American distribution business and merged it with Unisource to create a new publicly traded company called Veritiv, which is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. And I want to wish all of our former colleagues and Mary Laschinger, the Chairman and CEO of Veritiv, a lot of success going forward, and wish the new company well. So let's move on to the financials. That's Slide 6. EPS was $0.95 a share, up almost 50% over the second quarter of last year. EBITDA was $1.1 billion, up from $920 million in the first quarter. Margins grew as well, up 90 basis points over last year and 160 basis points over the first quarter. Free cash flow was $380 million compared to $250 million in the first quarter. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Carol and let her walk through the details on the quarter and the business results, and then we'll get to the forecast outlook and your questions. Carol L. Roberts: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me turn to the sequential EPS bridge, where it shows that we are $0.95 per share in the second quarter versus $0.61 per share in the first quarter. The strong results were driven by price improvement across several of the businesses. We had higher volume, solid operational performance across the enterprise and a significant positive noncash FX swing as the ruble recovered against the U.S. dollar on Ilim's JV U.S.-denominated debt. These positive swings were partially offset by significantly higher outage costs, as planned in the quarter, and as John referenced, they went very well. Some of the improvement in volume, operations and input costs, I can say, were attributable to moving past the weather disruptions in North America that did plague the first quarter. But beyond that, we experienced seasonal improvement in demand in North American Industrial Packaging and solid operating performance on all fronts. Courtland closure and transition costs were lower in the quarter, as expected. Input costs moderated slightly. However, I would say that they remained high throughout the quarter, and we're going to talk about the outlook going forward. Corporate items were slightly favorable, but they were more than offset by a slightly higher tax rate of 32%, as expected, and higher interest cost due to a tax reserve that was established in the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I want to take a look at the year-over-year input costs for the first half of 2014. And as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, wood and energy have been significantly higher, probably a bit higher than expected and significantly higher than last year. While they moderated slightly in the second quarter, we are seeing continued pressure on wood, higher electricity costs and higher chemical costs as we move through the third quarter. Turning now to the businesses. Industrial Packaging delivered strong results as prices held firm, volume increased, operations were solid and input costs moderated slightly. Pricing was stable in North America and up in Brazil. Volume was seasonally stronger in North America, and we also experienced significantly higher volume in our European Package -- Packaging business, as year-over-year volumes were up 5% for the second quarter and 4% year-to-date. So a very strong performance out of our European Packaging business. Operations recovered following the weather-plagued first quarter, and we successfully executed peak maintenance outages of $91 million. Input costs were lower by $13 million, primarily natural gas and OCC. As I move you to Slide 10, and take a look at the North American margin comparisons, IP and our team turned in another strong quarter and continues to outperform our primary competitors. These margins are inclusive of the significant maintenance downtime that we took in the quarter. Slide 11. I thought it'd be good if we took a look at our volume results for the U.S. Corrugated business. And as you can see, we were up a little over 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, right in line with the industry. It's interesting to note that when you take a look, a little deeper dive at our performance regionally, you can see that IP outperformed the industry east of the Rockies. The east of the Rockies represents about 82% of our business. We underperformed west of the Rockies, the remaining 18%. Our underperformance in the west is largely attributable to our heavy exposure to the agricultural box segment, which is having a tough growing season due to a number of unfavorable weather patterns. When you look at the right-hand side of the slide, we show some of our larger segments and how we're performing versus the average. You can see that poultry as well as shipping and distribution, and shipping and distribution does include e-commerce, are performing well. While, as I mentioned, ag is down, processed foods and the beverage segment, which are a couple of the largest segments we have, are basically flat year-to-date. I think this explains a lot about the overall results for not only International Paper but the industry. So our success in Industrial Packaging is evidenced in both our margin and our commercial and volume performance. We bring a lot of value to our customers that we serve. We have a top-notch commercial team, manufacturing and supply chain organization that is winning in the marketplace every day and, importantly, helping our customers win. So moving on to Consumer Packaging on Page 12. The Consumer Packaging business, we're starting to see the benefits of our commercial momentum that we've been talking about as we move past the last of the significant not only North American outages but European outages. Prices were up, on average, in our North American Coated Paperboard business, about $20 a ton. Volumes in both North America Coated Paperboard and our Foodservice business were up in the quarter, offset by lower volume in Europe due to a significant maintenance outage at our Kwidzyn mill. Our North American Foodservice business had a record quarter on revenue, up 11% year-over-year. Operations improved significantly as we moved past the weather and delivered solid performance for the quarter. Moving to Slide 13. As we've talked about previously, Consumer Packaging is really a second-half story. The first half results have clearly been burdened with the weather, heavy maintenance outages, high input costs and the construction and start-up of our grade enhancement project at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill. As we move into the second half of the year, most of our outage costs are behind us, volume will be higher due to less planned maintenance downtime, higher cup stock volumes due to the Foodservice growth and the growing shift from foam to paper cups, which is a real positive for us on both sides. Also, we expect to see additional benefits from the ramp-up of the new grade, Alaska Plus, out of our Kwidzyn, Poland mill. And finally, we'll see continued realization of the previously announced North American SBS price increases. This is all going to translate into higher earnings for the business for the balance of '14. Turning now to our global Printing Papers business. We experienced higher pricing in North America on uncoated freesheet and fluff pulp, as well as in Brazil on papers. Volumes were lower in North America as well as Brazil. Operations improved as, once again, we moved past the weather and performed well. Maintenance outages were high, offsetting $30 million of segment earnings, and input costs moderated slightly. And as I have previously mentioned, we did have lower costs at Courtland, as expected. The positive swing in other is primarily related to some favorable FX impact that we saw in Brazil. Looking at Slide 15. We thought it would be instructive to take a closer look at the sequential earnings across the Printing Papers business on a regional basis. And I would say that we feel the results were encouraging, really, across the globe. As a reminder, we have a truly global paper business. Roughly 2/3 of what we sell is produced outside North America. As this slide shows, North America was up solidly in both Printing Papers and pulp. Brazil was up as well, despite significant volume constraints, attributable to the additional government-declared holidays around the World Cup event and really less-than-robust demand. Europe was down, but that was entirely attributable to $23 million in higher outage expenses in the quarter. And for our Indian businesses, it was basically flat. So all in, the business performed well in the face of a mediocre global demand environment. Touching on the Ilim JV. It's good to report that the JV had another solid quarter of operating performance, as we had continued progress with both the ramp-up of Bratsk and continued good performance out of the Koryazhma mill. And this largely offset some lower pulp prices that we sold to China. Additionally, as John mentioned, we did have the positive swing to the JV earnings as the ruble strengthened against the U.S. dollar on the JV's $1.5 billion U.S.-denominated debt. The JV took a significant outage at the Bratsk mill at the beginning of the third quarter to address a bottleneck issue with the pulp digester, the cost of which will impact negatively our earnings in the third quarter. But the great news is productivity coming out of the outage is very encouraging and should enable acceleration of the JV's progress towards the final ramp-up to the original pulp mill project expectations. So let me kind of pull it all together on Slide 17, and take a look, moving forward, to the third quarter. As we see it, volume across the enterprise will be relatively stable, with some improvement in North America Consumer Packaging, as I described earlier. Pricing will be largely stable as well, with some continued realization of the previously announced price increases on fluff pulp and in our Coated Paperboard business in North America. We expect solid operating performance to continue across the businesses, and maintenance outages will be lower by a significant $135 million in the third quarter. We do expect input costs that will remain elevated and, in some cases, will increase slightly, as we've noted on the chart. In North America, our Papers and Packaging businesses, we expect to see continued pressure on wood costs, particularly in Texas and the surrounding region, along with higher electricity costs and higher chemical costs. In Brazil, we expect to see higher energy and fiber costs as well. At the Ilim JV, as always, we don't forecast FX movements, so the assumption is that, that gain of $0.07 won't repeat. And also, we have the additional cost of the outage at Bratsk early in the quarter. The anticipation of continued operational benefits, post the outage, are offset by lower average pulp prices for the quarter. And finally, with the spin of xpedx at the beginning of the third quarter, there is a nonrepeat of earnings and, additionally, an equivalent amount of transitional costs, much of which will work off over time. So finally, on 18, a couple more things to update on before I turn it back over to John. I think it's worth highlighting some of the significant developments in the quarter with regard to the company's finances. As you know, IP is in an excellent position, and we continue to get stronger. First, based on the consistency of our solid financial performance, Moody's upgraded our credit rating one notch. Additionally, in the quarter, we executed a bond issuance and a tender offer that enabled us to address the upcoming debt towers in 2018 and '19 and replace high-cost debt with lower-cost debt. We were able to take advantage of these historically low interest rates on 10- and 30-year debt and take some risk off the table in the upcoming term. As John mentioned earlier, we successfully executed the xpedx spin on July 1, and we received $400 million in cash. And additionally, our shareowners got 51% of the new company, Veritiv. We also received an additional $1.5 billion share buyback authorization from the board. In the quarter, we purchased $296 million of stock at an average price of just over $46. And from the inception of the program through June 30, we've purchased approximately $1.1 billion of stock at an average price of $46 a share. And finally, I want to mention that there's a potential Highway Trust Fund legislation that could have a positive impact on reducing future pension contributions, likely in the range of $800 million to $1 billion over the next few years. While there would be a corresponding loss of the tax deduction for these contributions, this would have a positive impact on cash available for reallocation. So all in all, some very good developments and accomplishments in the second quarter. So with that, let me turn it back over to John. John V. Faraci: Thanks, Carol. So summing up. The IP leadership team continues to find ways to build on our success and improve the strength and, importantly, the performance of International Paper. In addition to the accomplishments that Carol spoke about and, as I've said before, we've got many levers to pull to improve and deliver strong results despite a challenging global environment. We seem to come up with new reasons to have a challenging global environment every day, it seems. But I'm pleased with the progress we're making and the results we're posting along the way. We're generating strong, sustainable free cash flow, and we're deploying that cash with the objective of maximizing shareowner value. So all in, as we look to the future, we like what's ahead. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, just starting with -- and I know there were some comments on the news wires this morning. But can you talk a little bit about the MLP potential and how you would think about that and kind of how you -- just what obstacles and opportunities you might see? John V. Faraci: Sure. Carol L. Roberts: Yes, Gail. This is Carol. First, let me say, very importantly, that we maintain a constructive and open dialogue with all our shareholders. And we're always open to new ideas and ways to increase shareholder value. We have been studying the MLPs for some time. And for us, it just remains unclear as to whether this concept would really be value-creating for the company. Today, as I think everybody knows, and it's been written about, there is a moratorium on private letter rulings at the IRS. And there has been one prior favorable ruling on pulp but, as everybody knows, there's no precedent for containerboard or coated paperboard at this time. So all that said, even if we could get a private letter ruling from the IRS, we're not yet -- and I would say we're somewhat far from convinced that this would be a good idea, and a good idea, on a number of fronts, that are unique to International Paper and the business we're in. The first issue that you have is the potential tax cost and the tax leakage, given that the assets involved here are fairly highly depreciated. The other consideration that we're looking at very hard is the operational, commercial challenges and some of the restrictions on how it would require us to run the business. And then the third piece that really plays into an MLP is the capital considerations. And as everybody knows, in our business, we're a capital-intensive industry, and sometimes the capital, particularly in these big and integrated mills, can be fairly lumpy. So all that said, we're going to continue to evaluate it until we can reach a conclusion for ourselves and, importantly, until the IRS makes clear what their new requirements are going to be for MLPs. And so in the interim, we\u2019ll continue to operate our business as is, and we expect to do so for the foreseeable future. So we'll continue to study it and we'll look at it. And we're -- as we said, we're always looking for creative ways to unlock more value. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And can you just give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of demand trends in the third quarter? And maybe how this transitions from the second quarter into third quarter, I guess, in terms of key businesses as well as key global regions. John V. Faraci: Bill, do you want to talk about the box business? William P. Hoel: Going from the second quarter into the third quarter, we're not seeing much of a change in overall demand trend. We saw a week -- first week of the quarter with the holiday ending on a Friday, and you had a long weekend there. That impacted shipments for a couple of days. But since then, the trend has been very much the same as we saw in June. So we're not seeing a lot of changes in boxes. John V. Faraci: Anything else in particular, Gail, you want to hear about? Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, what you're seeing in China and maybe a little bit in uncoated freesheet and how the market may not have firmed up as I would've expected, given the magnitude of the closures. John V. Faraci: Tom Kadien was just in China, so he can speak to [ph] that. Thomas Gustave Kadien : Yes, China's kind of moving along. I'd say it's a slow growth. It's up a couple percent, 3%, which is less than we would normally feel. I think -- and I'm speaking right now about our box markets over there. There's a lot of capacity in all markets over there right now. And growth is positive, but it's not like -- it doesn't feel like the reported 7-plus percent that they're talking about for GDP. Timothy S. Nicholls: Gail, it's Tim. Just on the uncoated freesheet front, similar to Bill, we are seeing things from second to third quarter so far kind of moving along sideways. Having said that, we normally see a seasonal pickup as we go into August and September. So we'll have to see how that plays out. I would say, just globally, uncoated freesheet, because of a lot of factors around the world, has not had the year that we all thought it would from a demand standpoint, whether it's the Ukraine or the World Cup in Brazil. Our volumes in Brazil looked pretty flattish and anemic through the first half of the year. We thought the World Cup would help. It clearly did not. It actually hurt. So I would expect that, in the second half, there's an opportunity for things to pick up a little bit, but we'll just have to see how it plays out. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a question on Ilim. You have a slide that references $550 million to $600 million in fully ramped potential. Can you just give us some color on what fully ramped means? And what would be the time frame to potentially hit that? And then just maybe a related question. The U.S. and Europe put on a stricter round of sanctions on Russia. And I guess, you'd expect the Russians to reciprocate. Did the sanctions have any impact on Ilim or how you operate the business or generate earnings from the business? John V. Faraci: Well, let me take that in 2 pieces, Anthony. Just to give you a little bit more color on how we get to the $550 million to $600 million. The big piece of that is Bratsk. Before this outage, we were running the pulp mill at about 1,200 tons a day. Coming up out of the outage, and it's only been 10 days, we've been averaging 1,700 tons a day and hit over 1,900 tons a day in the first 10 days or so. So dramatic increase. The capacity of that pulp dryer is a little over 2,000 tons a day. So that has a huge impact on the cost structure of the mill, plus you've got the incremental volume. So that, and then getting the coater up and running at Koryazhma so we can make both uncoated paper, which we're making a lot of now, we're running that at design rates; and coated paper, we'll be the only supplier of coated paper in the Russian market, are -- will be the biggest pieces of getting from where we are, which is a run rate of, call it, $450 million, to the $550 million to $600 million. In terms of what's going on in the Ukrainian sanctions, we'd need to see the details on what this last round of sanctions that kind of were in the paper that the U.S. and the Europeans are putting on. I'd say, up to now, the impact on our business has primarily been felt in Eastern Europe. Obviously, Ukraine has been impacted a lot. It wasn't a big market for us, but the Eastern European markets have been impacted. The Russian economy was already slowing down. And sanctions, we wish there were a -- we could resolve these issues. But up until now, there's been no impact on our business other than the spillover of economic activity slowing down in Eastern Europe. And while this isn't a positive -- a plus for the Russian economy, the Russian economy was slowing down well before the Ukraine issue got on the radar screen. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on containerboard. Pulp and Paper Week recently lowered medium prices by $10 a ton and has talked about weakness in recycled prices. And I was wondering if that price reduction was surprising to you and if you could maybe characterize the impact to IP. Mark Stephan Sutton : Anthony, this is Mark Sutton. That's a great question. Let me -- before I answer that question, let me take this opportunity just to make a statement about -- as I roll into my new role. I've met many of you on the call. I look forward to spending more time with you in my new role. I've been spending time with our global business leaders and teams, getting up to speed, not only on near-term issues and what we can do for the rest of 2014 but also on the strategic front. And I'm increasingly coming away with a better feeling, an excited feeling about the opportunities we have as a company and also a better feeling in confirming my belief that we have the best people in the industry globally. So I'm excited about the new role, look forward to working with all of you that follow our industry and cover us. With respect to your question, I think the medium price changes that occurred, we view it as an isolated event and somewhat of a regional event. We haven't seen much of an impact on our business at all. As we said earlier, in Carol's part, our prices were firm through the quarter. I think you've got some issues going on that we've talked about at prior calls. As new capacity comes on, it's quite common for products to be made initially at the lower end of the technical scale. I think some of that's probably been happening, which requires some pricing behavior to get people to try it. So we don't see it as a big impact on our business at all. Operator : Our next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question, I guess, is more directed to you, Carol, about the Highway Trust Fund bill. You mentioned that it would maybe allow you to avoid, I guess, $800 million to $1 billion in contributions. Could you give us an idea of when that would occur? And maybe said differently or asked differently, what are your current forecasts for contributions, say, for '15, '16, maybe '17? And how would they differ? Carol L. Roberts: Chip, yes. So as you think about the things we've talked about, we said that we expected about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion to go into the pension, and that was like '13, '14, '15; '14 '15, '16, and so it was in that time frame. We didn't put much in '13. And as you can see through the cash flow statement so far this year, we've put in a little under $300 million, and we actually made another required payment in July. So we're up a little over $300 million this year. Now we have another required contribution in '15 and '16 that would be the balance of that $1.2 billion. So we were looking at roughly $1 billion of additional required contribution in '15 and '16. That's the contribution that we won't have to put in if, indeed, the bill gets passed and written into law as it's written today. And it's all around widening the corridor and pushing out the impact of these lower interest rates. So that's the impact we have. Now what happens on that, of course, is you'll lose those tax deductions, and so there's a cash tax implication. But all in all, if you say, \"Hey, we put $1 billion less in. We're going to have to pay taxes on that,\" you can see that you're going to net $600, $700 of positive cash over this period of time. That would've gone somewhere else, now we can do something else productive with. I hope that helps. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. I think you said something about -- I mean, as we look at the third quarter, maybe you can quantify the Bratsk outage. I'm not sure you did. And I think something was mentioned about lower pulp prices, and it seems like softwood has sort of hung in there. I know it can be quite volatile from Ilim into China, and so maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see the softwood pulp picture. Carol L. Roberts: Well, I could probably let Tim comment, but I think the softwood pulp, and I use the word very deliberately, average price. So it's average-to-average. So while our pulp prices are very stable now and we feel good about the markets going forward, there was some movement down in the price through the second quarter. But when you look at it average-to-average, it's lower. And relative to the Bratsk outage, we did not comment on the specific cost of that outage. We don't really disclose that for the JV, but it was a fairly good-sized outage. But the good news is, as John said, we're coming out of it running very, very well. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And do you think that better running in August and September could offset that cost? Or probably not quite? Carol L. Roberts: Well, that has the potential. And that's why we said we think that some of the good operations could offset the pulp price, and we'll have to see about how we run the rest of the quarter. But we've been running well, and so we've been pleasantly surprised the last couple of quarters relative to Ilim's operational performance. Operator : Next question is from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : John, just a couple of questions for you. First, just going back to the MLP question. Would you be able to tell us how long you've been looking into this question? And I know Carol provided some nice detail around some of the potential challenges, around the tax leakage and restrictions on capital spend and just the time that is necessary to really be able to thoughtfully address those questions. So I mean, from your perspective, outside of what the IRS may or may not say, how long do you think it may take before IP has a better view on whether or not it could sort of overcome those obstacles? Carol L. Roberts: Yes. So again, we'll -- we've been looking at it for quite a few months now. And as I said, we'll continue to evaluate that and also see where the IRS comes out on their requirements for MLPs. After the IRS decides, at that time, we'll have had enough time that we'll decide if we think that some proposed MLP structure has sufficient merits. And if that was the case, at that point, we'd pursue a private letter ruling. If we were to receive a private letter ruling and continue to take it [indiscernible], that's when we would make a public statement as such. But I think we're still a long ways from that between both our evaluation and really, where the IRS is. And so once again, as I said, we're going to continue to operate our business as is and continue to evaluate it and look at the complexities and the opportunity and see if there's really an opportunity for true value creation. John V. Faraci: Yes, and that said, I mean, if you look at IP's track record and the decisions we've made over the last 6, 7 years and, most recently, the spin merge with xpedx and Unisource, which was a transaction I think we were the first ones to do, take 2 private companies and take them public, we're ready, willing and able to do things that are complicated that we think create long-term value for the company and our shareowners. So there's more work to do. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Right, right. Very helpful, John and Carol. And just a question on Containerboard. Looking at industry inventory levels, relative to a 5- or 10-year average, they do seem -- or they are higher than that. I'm just curious if you can talk about where IP's inventory levels sit and how you feel about them. And then maybe looking back to last year, when we did have the inventory levels above the 10-year average, we saw the industry take some slow-back. So I'm interested in whether or not you're building in any slow-back of production to your output for the back half of the year on Containerboard? Mark Stephan Sutton : Alex, this is Mark. I'll take the inventory question. I think, with respect to IP's inventories, we manage our supply chain very, very efficiently, and we like the shape that our inventories are in right now. We have been operating on some supply chain metrics at best-ever levels in terms of having the right stock in the right box plants. Also, in a challenging transportation environment, managing our transportation cost the best we can. So we like where our inventories are. I think overall -- and I'm not going to comment on overall industry inventories and projecting slow-backs and that part of your question. What I will say, though, is the way we run our business -- now I'll remind you again, we look at our Containerboard business as a global business. We have 3 main channels that we bring our product to market. The biggest one, obviously, is our own box business. We also serve very important customers in the U.S. open market. And then thirdly, we export a significant amount of our containerboard to parts of the world that need it and value it. A portion of that is our own box plants internationally. So when we look at how we run our containerboard system, we run it to the demand we have from our customers through all 3 of those channels. And the float between the channels allows us to optimize the business at any given period in time and adapt to seasonal demand issues. So that really drives our decision for how we run our system, and that is based on the demand of our customers. Operator : Next question is from Al Kabili from Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : First question, I guess, is for Tim on the uncoated freesheet. The transitional costs with the Courtland closure, do we get any additional sequential benefit from that in the third quarter? It didn't look like there was much explicitly indicated in the outlook. Timothy S. Nicholls: Yes. It hasn't changed a whole lot, Al, since first quarter, when we updated everyone. But it'll be less than 10 in the third quarter and probably around 5 in the fourth quarter, and then it pretty much just trails off. So we're down to the final pieces at this point. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question that I had, I guess, is switching over to Containerboard. Mark, it looks like you're talking about flattish, no real change in volume trends in July. And if I look at the outlook, it sounds like you see, on the volume end of things, CPG improving in North America, on Slide 17. And I was wondering if you could kind of clarify the flattish July trends versus sort of the commentary on the outlook, if there's some visibility there that things are getting better. Kind of how are you thinking about what are you hearing from customers from a demand perspective on the outlook in the back half? Mark Stephan Sutton : Sure, Al. On the comments that Bill Hoel made about the box market in July, that was Corrugated Packaging. And on the outlook chart that you're looking at, that's all of our Packaging, and that CPG refers to our Consumer Packaging business, where we see improving -- slightly improving demand. And we have the capacity, with most of our outages behind us, to meet that. So that's the difference there. I think Bill covered some of it, and Carol had a piece on the slide that had our east and west breakout. So a lot of our customers inside of certain segments are still seeing their business driven as kind of a mirror image of the U.S. economy and the behavior of the consumers. There's some movement within segments. In the protein segment, some of the poultry businesses, as it's well-known, are doing better. And part of that's having to do with the challenges that the beef industry has had with corn prices. That tends to change over time. So within segments, there are different customers who have a certain product that's winning in the marketplace. We obviously try to align ourselves up with those customers. But the segments are so large and our corrugated position is so large that, over time, some of these trends tend to offset themselves. Unknown Executive : So 1 or 2 quarters [indiscernible] press release. John V. Faraci: The order activity in boxes for the last few weeks has been fairly decent. I think one other point that we didn't cover is that in July, we have 1 more day than we had last year or last month. So even though the daily shipments are relatively flat, you do have 1 more day, not only in the month but in the quarter, the third quarter versus second quarter. So that helps you out in overall absolute volume. But our order activity has been pretty strong. I think one of the other challenges we have in the second half of the year is the West Coast ag business. We're heavily involved in fresh fruit and vegetables in the West Coast. And with the drought conditions, it could be a little soft there. The rest of the segments that we serve, though, are relatively strong. So overall, we're more than making up for the weakness in the fresh fruit and vegetables in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : First, I was hoping -- can we get an update on your dealings with the mills you had divested as part of the Temple acquisition? I think the Indy paper, I think that contract was potentially going to change at midyear. Mark Stephan Sutton : Sure, Mark. The divested mills, there were 3 mills that we divested, just about 1 million tons. Two of them were for the creation of New-Indy Containerboard. Yes, there was a 3-year agreement to purchase tons from those divested mills and with a -- its really agreed-upon ramp-down. And so we're just progressing through that, and I think it's been working pretty well in terms of the -- where we started a couple of years ago, and it goes through the middle of next year. And so we're continuing to purchase from that mill and also the third one, which was purchased by Hood Container. And those are mostly making medium, a product that we are obviously short of after selling those mills. And so we're continuing with the current plan of ramp-down, and we'll get to the final year between this summer and next summer when the final 12 months of the agreement unfolds. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. And so it's a ratable ramp-down, is the way we should think about it? Mark Stephan Sutton : Yes. It's not a cliff drop-off in volume. That works really for all supply chains, ours as well as the companies that we sold the mills to. So we designed a smooth ramp that just allows us to perform at the most cost-effective way and the best service platform we can have to our converting plants. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay, great. And... John V. Faraci: The DOJ agreement expires in July of next year. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And second, in prior calls, you've given some guidance indications on free cash flow. Would those be pretty much unchanged as you're looking at 2014 right now? Or any adjustments? Carol L. Roberts: Yes, I think we still feel good about our free cash flow generation capability. We had some headwinds. We had headwinds in the first quarter relative to the weather. It's hard to see us getting that back. I feel like we've got a headwind around some input costs that seem to be trending a bit higher than maybe what we had expected. But the businesses continue to run well, and so it's going to be all around the second half performance. So I feel good about -- that we are going to have another strong year of that free cash flow performance that we've talked about. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I had a couple of questions, maybe for Carol or for Tom. Realizing that pricing is going to be a key driver of this, if we held pricing flat at today's level or second quarter average levels, if you prefer that, what kind of ramp-up would you be having us think about in terms of the consumer segment profitability versus the first half? The second question I had is, could you update us on the thoughts at Orsa, Tim, given the performance? It's obviously been improving. What type of ramp and what type of attack do you need to see to get Orsa back to a more profitable level? And I actually had one follow-on, if there's time. Thomas Gustave Kadien : George, this is Tom. On the pricing. The first quarter announcement, I think we showed about $5 in the second -- at the end of the first quarter. I think our AGS is up another 21, since that's the average in the second quarter. And as we exit rate out of the second quarter, we still have more realization to get in the third quarter off of that first quarter increase. So it's fully in. We announced 50. We'll net less than 50 but more than 40. Timothy S. Nicholls: George, it's Tim. On Orsa. Yes, it's gone slower than we wanted it to, but I think we have finally started getting traction. One of the things that hasn't helped has been the market. The market's actually slightly negative year-to-date versus last year. And coupled with that, we've had a few customers that, because of market conditions and their position, they've struggled, and that's impacted us. Having said that, I feel really good about what has started happening over the past couple of months on the commercial side. We've had some capital that has started going in that is allowing us to automate some of the facilities and reduce headcount. So our costs are going to start coming in line. The mills are running well. They had a better quarter in the second quarter than in the first. And I would expect another -- we took a bit of a step-up in the second quarter versus the first, I would expect a more significant one between now and the end of the year. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Tom, just a quick one, if I could. So is there a way to size what kind of improvement, overall, the segment should be if you hold your pricing where it is? And if it's not possible to guide in that way, should we assume that most of the benefit you see, second half versus first half, is pricing? And then a quick one on MLP. You can answer this just yes or no. How significant is the question of integration of the box plants with the mills in terms of understanding the complexity in terms of whether MLP structures make sense for you or not? Carol L. Roberts: I'll do the last one first. Yes. Thomas Gustave Kadien : And in terms of the Coated Paperboard business here in North America, the third quarter's going to be a significant ramp-up. We'll get price realization, as I outlined. But we had significant outages. We've had a tough first half, frankly. We had weather in the first quarter. We had outages in just about every month up through May, and we finally started to see our stride in the June month. We've got good backlogs coming out of the quarter. Pricing's headed up. So we'll show the earnings power of the business that we used to enjoy 1 or 2 years ago before we had to shut down Augusta PM#2. So we'll have a good third quarter. Operator : The next question is from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Yes, my question was also on Bleached Board. So the momentum that we've just been discussing, that's the final implementation of the April price hike? Am I -- is it safe to assume that the July 1 hike had no impact, but we've got one pending for September 1, and that's presumably more of a Q4 event as well? Thomas Gustave Kadien : Yes, we're talking -- I've been talking about our first quarter announcement that we implemented in the second quarter, and there's a tail of realization in the third quarter. Some of our competitors have announced increases, either in June or more recently, and I'm not going to really speak to that on this call. But we see strong backlogs. Our backlogs are 5 weeks coming out of the Fourth of July holiday. And we feel pretty good going into the third quarter. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Great. And then also on the MLP, I guess it's more of an observation. It's safe to say that this is definitely a big-brainer as opposed to a no-brainer, but you guys won't proceed without a private letter ruling? Carol L. Roberts: Yes, a private letter ruling is required. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Okay. Because I think you could assume the risk, but then if you have an adverse decision, then it's on you. But -- okay. John V. Faraci: We'll put it back together again. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Wilde from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Mark Wilde : John, I wondered if you or Carol would want to just comment on timing of the share repurchase, particularly the new program. Because you've just -- you have moved through that first program so much more rapidly than the targets you'd laid out last year. Carol L. Roberts: Yes, Mark. I think this is a clear example of we embarked on something and we said, \"Hey, we've got a great opportunity to provide cash back to our shareowners.\" We'd like to do it opportunistically. The key tenet is we prefer to buy the stock, obviously, at intrinsic value or below. And when we see a good opportunity to buy back stock, we've done so. We're continuing to generate strong cash, so we feel like it's an important part of our capital allocation strategy. And I think, looking backwards, you can see our actions. And getting the next $1.5 billion authorized is about being ready to continue to move in that direction. We're in a strong cash position, so we'll continue to work in this direction, and I think it's become an important part of International Paper's more strategic capital allocation program. John V. Faraci: I would just emphasize what Carol said at the end. I mean, if you think about balanced use of cash and where we are with the balance sheet and our dividend, it's not policy, but we told the shareowners about the dividend, 30% to 40% of free cash flow, because taking share buybacks is part of the way IP deploys cash and returns cash to shareowners. Mark Wilde : Okay. The follow-on I had was just around kind of bulk margins in Containerboard and Uncoated Free Sheet. On the Containerboard side, you talked a while back about $200 million in kind of further optimization in that business. Maybe you can give us an update on where you're at with that and what the timing is? And then also what the target would be for, ultimately, for margins in the North American Printing Paper business. Mark Stephan Sutton : Mark, this is Mark Sutton. On the Containerboard piece of that question, and then I'll turn it over to Tim on Printing Papers. We called it an optimization plan, and we never plan to report in the detail that we did on synergies, but we are making really good progress. If you think about the performance of the business in light of this sort of flattish environment that we've had for demand, a good bit of those results are internal improvements that are part of the optimization plan. We've seen a big step-up in our ability to get our converting operations ready to perform at their full capability, and I'll just give you a couple of examples. Once we put the newly acquired mills we got from Temple onto our common supply chain system, we're really able to take cost out of our supply chain on the freight and logistics side but also in the performance inside of our converting operations. So we are operating -- almost on a monthly basis, we're setting new best-evers for waste management and the throughput and other metrics we use to measure productivity, are now on a much steeper ramp of improvement. And a lot of that has to do with sort of running this large mill system in the most efficient way possible from a total delivered cost standpoint, not just a mill cost standpoint. So we're pleased with the progress against that $200 million. And not a lot of it was based on a great market, so the volume not materializing isn't really hurting us. It was based on running better and reducing cost in our mills. We've had one whole set of outages that we've done on the new mills, and we've implemented some of the changes. We've got to do another round of that to get some of the cost reduction projects fully implemented. And I think we'll be definitely on track to meet and probably exceed our optimization target. I'll turn it over to Tim. Timothy S. Nicholls: On the Printing Papers side, it's probably difficult to forecast margins in a declining market. Having said that, we feel pretty good about where we are. We've got 2 specialty mills that we're still working on cost optimization opportunities as well as mix opportunities. And we've got 2 large commodity mills where we're doing the same thing. So there's -- the bulk of it's going to come from cost and mix, and we'll have to see what demand does. But clearly, with Courtland behind us, we move up to mid- to slightly above mid-teens, and then we'll have to see where that goes for 2015 as we look at market declines for the rest of the year. But there's still good opportunities around changing what runs through our mills and continuing to refine that. And there's very good opportunities on the cost side. Operator : Our next question is from Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I was wondering if you could comment on the 430,000 tons or so at Valliant that you could hypothetically bring back online, and kind of the decision-making process around that. And then like what the costs associated would be and the benefits that you would expect. Mark Stephan Sutton : Debbie, this Mark. First of all on Valliant. We haven't made a decision on Valliant. We've talked about it on prior calls as a way to potentially optimize our capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, Valliant's a very valuable asset as we look at our overall business. We talked earlier on the call about the divestiture of 1 million tons of containerboard. We don't talk about it a whole lot, but our European and other international box businesses use over 2.5 million tons of containerboard, and that's part of that global channel selection I talked about. We've increased, over the last 4 years, by over 0.25 million tons our shipments from IP mills in the U.S. to our international box plants. There's more opportunity there. We still purchase over 1 million tons in the international market from third-party producers. We've also got grades inside of our Containerboard system that are very attractive, but they're not containerboard, and that business has grown. Most of those products go into the building materials market. And so when you look at all the moving parts, a machine like Valliant in a mill that's already running with an efficient use of fixed cost would be a potential winner for our system. So when and if we make a decision, we'll definitely come out and communicate it. But it's all wrapped around making the containerboard and some of these other specialty products that we need to serve our customers. So Valliant's an existing machine, as you know, so the cost to bring it back up is part getting things maintained and back in shape to run and then part the shutdown several years ago, and there's some cost efficiency that we can do if we were to start it up to run it at a lower cost, better energy usage and so forth. So stay tuned on that. We definitely are looking at Valliant, but not only Valliant. There's other opportunities we have in our system to continue to optimize it. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And my follow-up just relates to your -- what you referenced. I just was wondering if you could comment on the overall health of demand in the regions where you compete. And then I think there've been some pricing increases for containerboard, and whether or not you expect that to roll through on your corrugated box pricing. Mark Stephan Sutton : So on regional corrugated box demand, I think we made some earlier comments. I think John mentioned the European business. We're outperforming the market in our European business, which, again, is Western European kind of industrial markets and then the Mediterranean region for agricultural markets. And we're seeing slightly better demand in that region for the market, and we're doing a little bit better than that. There has been some price announcements and movements on recycled linerboard in Europe. That's still yet to be determined. Some of those were just announced. But overall, we've seen stable pricing. Some isolated cases of prices moving up and down in a specific country or a specific region, and that tends to be directly related to, more or less, supply showing up at any moment in time. But overall, I'd say demand in our global regions -- I think Tom mentioned what's happening in Asia, growth, but not quite as much as we had seen in the past. And Tim talked about Orsa. But stable demand in most of the regions, and pricing is relatively stable. So Corrugated Packaging business is, obviously, one we like, and we're looking forward to seeing further improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Carol, just one more follow-up on the MLP issue. Setting aside the other issues you discussed, which I know are important, which you can't practically set aside, do you have a view regarding the multiple uplift that would come from dropping some of your virgin mills into an MLP structure? And whether the MLP multiple premium, over your current multiple that exists today, is likely to persist for years into the future? Carol L. Roberts: So as we think about what really is a multiple expansion, it really has to be something underneath that's value-creating, that changes the value of the business. And the one that is clear is the tax advantage, if you can capture it and hold it and you don't lose it in some other way. So clearly, in a partnership arrangement, it's a pass-through, so you eliminate one level of taxation. But that's a price that's specific, that you can quantify. Once again, the key issue is, is can you maintain that price and not lose it to other complexities or other places that, that price is lost? Outside of that, I probably wouldn't comment on relative to multiple or margin -- or multiple expansion in the rest of the business. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right. No, sure. And Mark, just one on containerboard export markets. I know you were just talking about Europe specifically, but can you characterize the state of the export markets? And are they appreciably different than they were 3 months, 6 months, 9 months ago? Mark Stephan Sutton : I would say not appreciably different. There is -- we have seen some additional supply, mostly from the U.S., in some markets, which is not uncommon. And I think we've mentioned it before, probably related to a little bit of the capacity start-ups. But other than that, we see pretty stable markets. Most of what we export is kraft liner, and those segments have done most of the switching between recycle and virgin that they can do. So they tend to buy because they need it. And so not a big, significant difference in any of those time increments you mentioned. John V. Faraci: Let me wrap up here. We had a solid quarter. We feel good about the quarter. We think of success as a journey at International Paper. We're far from done. We're generating strong, sustainable free cash flow. And I think, importantly, for all of our shareowners, we're deploying that cash in a way to maximize shareowner value. And as I said before with the Q&A, all-in as we look to the future, we like what's ahead. We're ready for both the opportunities and the challenges. So thank you. Jay Royalty : So thanks, John, and thanks, again, to all of you for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call, and our phone numbers are on Slide 20 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

Davidson Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities Operator : Good morning. My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Rachel. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning will be Mark Sutton, Chief Executive Officer; along with Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, slide four provides context around the Ilim joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining our call today. Regarding the format for today\u2019s call, it will be similar to what we've done recently. Carol and I will review our third quarter 2014 results and the performances of our individual businesses. We will then take a look at the fourth quarter outlook and open it up for your questions. I am on slide five now, International Paper delivered a record quarter both EBITDA and free cash flow in the third quarter. We had strong performance from many of our businesses, as our team continues to execute very well. We announced the dividend increase of 14% from a $1.40 to $1.60 per share, which is our third consecutive fourth quarter double-digit increase. We continue to opportunistically buyback shares and have purchased more than 1.4 billion worth of shares since last September and through yesterday as of this call. Additionally, we received the dividend of $56 million from Ilim during the quarter and the JV continues to ramp up post the major capital projects and had another good quarter of solid performance. Due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble, the JV took large non-cash charge against its U.S. denominated debt. Moving to the financials on slide six, I\u2019d note that beginning this quarter, xpedx is reflected as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. And as you can see, International Paper delivered strong financial results across the Board. As mentioned earlier, both EBITDA and free cash flow are at record levels as was EBIT. Our EBITDA margins approached 20% for the entire company for the quarter. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Carol Roberts and ask her to discuss the details on the quarter, as well as results of respected businesses. Carol? Carol Roberts : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide seven, the sequential EPS bridge, IP earned $0.95 per share in the third quarter versus $0.93 per share in the second quarter. This was a strong performance for the company, particularly given the significant EPS impact of $0.25 per share sequentially from the FX on the Ilim debt that you see on the right hand side of the slide. So talking about the business fundamentals, pricing was relatively stable across the businesses, as was volume. Operational performance remained strong and contributed favorably to the results. Maintenance outages were substantially lower as we expected. Input costs moderated very slightly, but in our view remained at relatively high levels and if you\u2019ll take a look at slide 42 in the appendix, you will see that input costs are actually $26 million higher than the same period last year and this is mostly driven by wood costs. Tax and interest expenses came in slightly lower than the second quarter, so a sequential pickup. And as Mark mentioned earlier, all results have been revised to account for xpedx moving to discontinued operations. Now turning to the individual businesses, Industrial Packaging delivered a really outstanding quarter, record earnings driven by stable prices, solid operations and lower outage expenses. The modest softness we experienced in pricing was attributable to lower export pricing, contributed also due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our lower volume quarter-over-quarter was driven by reduced U.S. exports. They were down 44,000 ton and lower shipments in our European Packaging business, which is really due to seasonal factors. Operations were strong as our teams continued to run well and as expected we had fewer outages. Relative input costs the benefit of lower OCC was offset by higher wood costs in the quarter. Turning to the North American Industrial Packaging margin comparison, we turned in another really strong quarter and continued to outperform our primary competitors both for the quarter and the trailing 12-month period. Slide 10 is a slide that we used on last quarter that we introduced to take a deeper dive relative to demand and volume for the U.S. Corrugated business. And if I draw your attention to the map, you can see that for about 80% of our business, which is east of the Rockies, we actually outperformed the industry with a little over 2% year-over-year growth. This performance relates to the strong positions and superior value propositions we have with customers who are winning in their respective segments. West of the Rockies, which represents about 19% of our business we trail industry for the quarter and this is primarily due to weakness associated with the agricultural business affected by drought and other weather-related circumstances and for International Paper this is a segment where we have a significant position. Turning now to Consumer Packaging, we talked about a strong second half story and I would say that we clearly executed in that regard in the third quarter. On pricing we saw an increase in North America that was more than offset by what's going on in Asia and Europe, and let me speak to both of those for a moment. In Europe due to weaker demand in our home markets, we are exporting more and this business comes at more competitive prices and margins, which negatively impacts our mix. In Asia, due to the excess capacity of the industry, our margins have also declined. So that\u2019s the pricing and mix story. On the volume side, we saw a nice increase in volume in North America coming out of the heavy outage quarter and our Foodservice business had another record quarter with revenue up 15% year-over-year. Europe also saw improvement as we had a full production quarter at our Kwidzyn, Poland mill following the extended outage we took to do some very nice work on our paperboard machine there. And finally, as you can operations were much stronger throughout a steady third quarter and also in the absence of the heavy outages. So turning to slide 12, looking at our relative EBITDA margins in North America. You can see the significant improvement coming out of the second quarter and the first half of the year, and we do expect to carry this momentum through the fourth quarter and as we exit 2014. Slide 13, turning to our Global Printing Papers business, we experienced solid improvement in earning this business as well. Prices were stable in North America and up in pulp, particularly fluff. In Europe we did experience some declines in our paper pricing. Volume was stronger particularly in North America, as we took advantage of all our channels to market, including export. And in Brazil we saw some improvement in volume. Although, we would say, that the fundamentals in Brazil do remain challenging. On the operational front, overall performance was solid. The Courtland closure and transition is complete. Although, there will be some minimal costs that will continue for facility maintenance and security. And we also saw an FX benefit due to our export positions in Brazil and Europe. Looking at the North American margin comparison for the Papers business, the Portland shutdown has been concluded and we had a solid quarter. And if you consider the impact of the shutdown and transition costs, this negatively impacted on margins over the last 12 months by roughly 200 basis points. Slide 15, I think this is a great slide that tell us a really good story relative to the state of the global paper business. This chart reflects the year-over-year earnings change by region for the third quarter and in North America, you can see even with Courtland out this year versus last year, earnings actually increased by $13 million. In our pulp business, due to the continued performance in ramp-up of the Franklin operation along with improved pricing, earnings increased by $17 million. And in Brazil, despite weakening -- weakened economic conditions, earnings are up $13 million year-over-year. In Europe, where I mentioned our demand is down in our home market, we have had to expand our export reach to compensate. And there you can see earnings are flat to slightly down. In India, due to improvement on a number of fronts where we\u2019ve executed well, earnings have also increased by $7 million. So all-in-all the business continues to move forward and produce improved results despite what we all would consider a challenging global environment. Turning to Ilim on slide 16. The joint venture had another solid quarter of performance, turning in $100 million of operational EBITDA on slightly lower quarterly sales of $520 million due to the significant outage at Bratsk mill that was successfully executed and taken early in the quarter. The board of the JV elected to pay dividend during the quarter of which our share was up 56 million, which that was a good thing. But due to the 17% evaluation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, Ilim took a non-cash charge of $210 million on it U.S. denominated debt. Now, just a reminder, on the flip side of the unfavorable non-cash FX impact on the JV\u2019s debt, earnings are favorably impacted by a ruble devaluation as -- I can give you a couple of numbers here, as 95% of our cost are on ruble but the vast majority of our exported products, which account for over half of the JV sales are sold in U.S. dollars. So net-net all-in, the situation in Russia for us remains favorable. Speaking of the favorable conditions, I wanted to take a minute to highlight a significant progress that we're making at the Ilim JV particularly with regard to the productivity ramp up at the Bratsk mill. As you can see on the chart on the right hand side of the page, Bratsk came into the year at a run rate of a little over 60% of full production for the mill. The team has been making steady progress throughout the year with an achievement of nearly 90% in the third quarter, following the major outage that I said was very successfully taken early in the quarter. And the team expects to exit the year at full production, averaging mid 90% levels for the fourth quarter. So this is on track with the JVs target for the new pulp line to be fully ramped up by year end. So let me turn now to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Volume will be lower predominantly due to seasonality, which is simply three less shipping days in the North American box business, which for us translates to roughly 120,000 fewer ton. This will be slightly offset by seasonally stronger conditions in Brazil. Moving to pricing and mix. We do expect pricing and mix to be lower in our North American paper business, really due to some seasonal weakness. And we also expect lower average export pricing for our containerboard for industrial packaging business. And I will also attribute this due to the normal seasonal weakness that we see this time of the year combined with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And finally we do expect to see lower pricing and less favorable regional mix in Europe and Russia. We expect operations to continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. We don't expect overall input cost to moderate to any degree in aggregate with anticipated higher wood cost likely offsetting any benefits from lower OCC and energy costs. Maintenance outages are forecasted to increase by about $60 million sequentially. We expect to see a positive swing from a significant FX charge at the Ilim JV. However, as you all know looking at the ruble today, some of that could be offset by further devaluation that we\u2019ve seen to date. But as our practice has been, we don\u2019t attempt to forecast where the ruble will be at the end of the quarter. And finally, we assume the tax rate to normalize in -- in line with our full-year outlook and for corporate expenses to come in around $15 million for the fourth quarter given the year-end true up. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Carol. So let me just summarize our remarks and wrap it up. IP had a very strong quarter setting records on a number of fronts as we continue to run our businesses very well. While we expect this strong execution to continue, our outlook for the fourth quarter is impacted by fewer shipping days in North American box and $60 million in higher planned maintenance outage expenses. We are leveraging our well-positioned businesses particularly in the absence of any tailwinds in most markets. Our teams around the globe are executing very well and are continuing to find ways to drive improved results and create value. Our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and sustainable which is enabling IP to deliver on its capital allocation strategy. We have delivered three consecutive annual double-digit increases in the dividends and today we are within $100 million of completing the original $1.5 billion share buyback program, that was authorized back in September 2013. We continue to look for value creating opportunities for reinvestment, for example, the recently announced restart project of our number three paper machine at Valliant for our containerboard business, the expansion of our Canton, Ohio foodservice facility and the coated paperboard enhancement project, we completed and are in current ramp up at our Kwidzyn mill in Poland. IP\u2019s financial state is very solid. We remain focused on the execution of the plans we\u2019ve outlined and going forward, we expect to make continued progress toward our key goals. Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to give you a brief update on where we are with the master limited partnership opportunity. As we said at the UBS conference in September, we moved to a more intensive evaluation phase. We\u2019ve retained a team of external advisors and are actively working with them at this time. As part of the process of our discovery, we\u2019re also talking to several companies in other industries. We have formed and are operating an MLP in an effort to better understand the process and their experiences. There is a lot of work going on to better understand what an MLP structure might look like specifically for International Paper and whether we would benefit from such a structure and whether we can create value for our shareholders. I can tell you we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re learning through this process. And as part of our continuing evaluation, it is our intention to file a request with the IRS for the private letter ruling and we\u2019re working with our advisors to get ready to do so. And with that, we'll be happy to open it up for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub. Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group : Thank you. I hope this is a fair question for quarterly earnings call but Mark, since you've taken over, as IP's CEO and I just wanted to throw this question at you. What do you think are the key levers you can pull to take IP to the next level or put it different way? What are the biggest opportunities that you're looking to act on in the next couple of years? Mark Sutton : I guess, it\u2019s a fair question, Mark. It\u2019s an obvious one as well. I think we've got a strategy that we\u2019ve embarked upon and we shared with the investment community, we shared with our employees. And we still got more runway on our current strategy and so executing very well against our current plans, which is essentially advantaged positions in paper and packaging globally, creating value for our shareholders. That\u2019s still the important near-term task. And obviously without being able to predict the future as we go out beyond two years, we\u2019ll have to continue to evaluate where we can create value. And I\u2019m sure, can\u2019t tell you what it will be, but I\u2019m sure International Paper will evolve and will be different in five years than it is today. But the bottom line is we're committed to a strategy of balance used for the cash. We think we can continue to generate healthy cash flow and we\u2019re going to look for ways in a balanced fashion to create value for the long-term. Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group : And just as quick follow-up and how important is M&A to the strategy and how -- and do you feel that you're somewhat constrained given the various market positions that you already have? Mark Sutton : I think in general, M&A is obviously a tool in your strategy toolbox. I wouldn\u2019t comment on where we might be constrained or not. But I think IP is not a mergers and acquisition story to create value going forward. As you mentioned, we have strong positions in certain markets but there are opportunities for us to improve what we have. And I think M&A will come out where it comes out based on the opportunities we see in front of us. But all against the backdrop of creating value for the long-term. Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group : Okay. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Our next question is from the line of George Staphos. George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Again, congratulations everyone in their new endeavors. I guess the first question I had on MLPs, Mark, could you comment at all, or Carol, if you could comment on you're more encouraged by what you have found recognizing you still have more work to do. Relative to when you first examined the structure or thought about it to the current time, what has been the biggest source or biggest couple of sources of incremental encouragement or view on how it could create value? Mark Sutton : George, I will just a make general comment and I will ask Carol to elaborate. I think what we talked about at the UBS Conference, I\u2019ll refer to as learning how this specifically would work in, for example our containerboard business and whether or not, our core principles have been able to run the business effectively, can be maintained is what we're learning and most encouraged about. And as you remember, IP had a master limited partnership in our timberlands business years ago. We weren\u2019t worried about the complexity. We were worried about whether or not the specific applications of this structure in this type of business and the way we need to run the business could work. I think we're learning more about that that a lot of those issues are manageable and Carol, if you would\u2026? Carol Roberts : Yeah. And I will do it from the other side. The other part we\u2019ve learned is why would IP specifically be attractive to investors in an MLP, and what would they be looking for and what is it that we offer that would be attractive to that investor base and what would that be worth to them, because that\u2019s what ultimately translates back to the value of International Paper. So just learning about the value drivers of MLPs. That\u2019s been -- that we\u2019ve learned a lot and we see some encouraging things from there. George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : If I could tag on, and again maybe this is preliminary and thus you can't really get to it. Would it be feasible in your view, given your work to date, for other portions of IP to be suitably dropped into the MLP, or have you not gotten to that point yet in terms of your valuation? Mark Sutton : George, that\u2019s the type detail that we aren\u2019t really prepared to go into. But I can tell you that we\u2019ve got a holistic approach to this and that\u2019s how we are going to continue with it. But specifics about the structure and all that, it\u2019s not the right time right now. George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. My last question. I'll turn it over to the rest of the analysts. A couple years ago, you talked about the $5 billion EBITDA goal, the Drive for Five, so to speak. Is it possible to comment in terms of how you gauge your prospects for reaching that given the current structure of IP and the current trends that you have both going for you and against you? Thanks. I'll turn it over. Mark Sutton : Okay. George. That\u2019s a great question. I mean, we are committed, we laid it out there back in 2012 that we were shooting for a milepost of $5 billion in EBITDA and we are not ready to give up on that. It\u2019s harder to get to and we are getting there in a different way and I think the biggest gap we have is what we describe as mid-cycle conditions or mid-cycle cost and demand environment. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen that yet. But obviously, as I step into my role, we are rejuvenating our efforts to find additional ways with what we have today to try to get as close to that and look at reaching that target. So that\u2019s our approach. We made a commitment and we are focused on trying to find the way to get there. We knew it would be different than we laid out. We just didn\u2019t know what the actual path would look like. So, aspirational, a little bit but we think we have the company today that with the right conditions, we can achieve that level of performance. George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly. Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities : Thank you. So we're starting to see more capacity announcements in India from local players mostly and you said you're looking more. Have you come to the conclusion that India's a big opportunity? I think in the past, IP has described it as sort of its investment as a learning experience Mark Sutton : Mark, I will make a general comment about how I kind of personally view India, then I will ask maybe, Tom Kadien to elaborate given his been running and will continue to be responsible. I think you are right. We said India has maybe the potential for the future and we want to start to learn how to do business there. I think we\u2019ve learned some things in the last three years. I wouldn\u2019t say our view has changed dramatically like -- that we see something that we didn\u2019t see two or three years ago. But we do see the potential. We see the potential in the packaging area. And so we\u2019ll be very measured and very careful with what we do in India. But it is still a market that is intriguing and again it\u2019s for the future, not for tomorrow. And Tom and if you would maybe add a few comments. Tom Kadien : Yeah. Mark, not a lot more to add to that. But it\u2019s three years for us in the paper business over there. We made a lot of strides that have been covered up by wood cost and slowing economy. But I would say we are as optimistic about the fundamental opportunity in India as we were -- when we bought our way into APPM. And I think the capacity announcements that you're talking about are really on the containerboard side. We think that\u2019s also an opportunity for the future, but we\u2019ve got to earn our strides in the paper business first. Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And second, in the second quarter, John Faraci said that his target was to buy back your stock below intrinsic value. I'm wondering whether you apply that same basic metric to acquisitions with maybe intrinsic value plus expected synergies. I was wondering if Carol could remind us how you do think about acquisition value. Carol Roberts : Yeah. Mark, clearly our goal on acquisition is to create value which comes quite simply to we use our methodology\u2019s discounted cash flow model, trying to look at all of the cash in for what we can get out of the base business plus synergies. And we want a nice spread between our -- what we view our cost of capital against what the return on that project could be and that\u2019s all around the assumptions you make. And you can make those numbers tell you lots of things. So what we tried to do really hard is we look at cost of capital by region. We don't use one number for the company and we pressure test the assumptions real hard. And quite honestly to make our IP more valuable, we need a nice spread between our cost of capital and the potential return out of those projects. And we have a very robust review process here where we debate it, when we talk about it. And John always encourages us to have multiple of view and I think we\u2019ll continue on path. So, I think you would find us to do the work much like you would expect. Mark Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Good morning. Could we just start, maybe a little bit on the demand environment, kind of puts and takes, gas prices are down. Are you seeing that flow through to some of your business that might be tied closer to the consumer? Just generally speaking, maybe touch on what you're seeing in Brazil and China as well in paper versus board? Mark Sutton : So, I think maybe the best way to do that is to have maybe Tim Nicholls talk a little bit as he enters into the Industrial Packaging role, which is obviously the best bellwether we have for general demand environment in economy then we will kind of touch on the other parts? Tim Nicholls : Sure. Thanks Mark. Good morning, everyone. I think demand\u2019s been pretty stable. We saw our box demand in the quarter just slightly behind where the overall market was, and Carol pointed out the factors between east and west. If you look at the east, we performed fairly well both in absolute and on a relative basis. So I think demand fills okay here in the U.S. It\u2019s actually been pretty good. Export markets; we did see some seasonal weakness, but I think beyond a seasonal, I think it\u2019s just more of new capacity pushing out some suppliers from North America and other parts of the world. And we bump up in a lot of parts of the world because of the size of the system we are. So we probably got hit by that just a little bit more than maybe others. If you look at Brazil, Brazil on the paper and on the box side has struggled give them the economic environment. They are technically in recession first two quarters of this year. And it\u2019s been exacerbated on the packaging side of Brazil just because of how some of our biggest customers have been impacted in their markets. They have lost share to local suppliers, which is filtered through the supply chain to us. We will see what happens now. I kind of felt like Brazil had taken a bit of a pause. It was hurt by the World Cup and then it went into a pause waiting on the outcome of the election. The election is behind now. We will see what impact that has on the balance of the year. Fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally stronger quarter both for paper and packaging. In the paper markets there, the domestic markets have been weak. The export markets around Latin America have been a little more robust, but not the kind of strength that we\u2019ve seen in prior years. But still from how we performed, we are better than market on domestic paper in Brazil and we are kind of flattish on export volume to Latin America. Mark Sutton : Yeah. I will wrap up the demand comments with China and our demand probably reflects the Chinese economy. It\u2019s slowed down. We still have pockets of positive demand growth, but it doesn\u2019t mirror a 7% plus GDP number that gets published mainly because our demand is really dependent on one component of that GDP and that\u2019s the consumer and/or exports and both of those or it\u2019s sluggish in China right now. So we don\u2019t see it getting a lot worse right now, it\u2019s just not the level of demand growth that we\u2019re accustomed to. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Okay. And then just on the MLP, I guess you said one of the considerations that you learnt about is the value drivers and what investors would be looking for. Can you give a little bit of insights, certainly one thing investors look for typically is yields driven? And just how you are thinking about the more normalized interest environment might impact the success of an MLP? Carol Roberts : Sure, Gail. Yes, so it\u2019s MLP 101, so I will be brief, but it\u2019s about the yield, but it\u2019s about the growth rate and it\u2019s about the longevity. And when you think about International Paper with the size and scale of the system we have, we\u2019ve got a lot of EBITDA, lot of cash flow, and so you\u2019ve got growth and you\u2019ve got longevity. And then if you look at the value to the International Paper shareholder, the value comes from your general partner stake and your incentive distribution right stake. So you\u2019ve got some drivers that could be valuable to International Paper. So then it comes back to what Mark said, okay given those things, if you believe those are real and you\u2019ve got enough experience to see actual examples of that, what would it take to run it in the business we\u2019re in and with the company we have and the structure we have to not violate our true north goals of how we know we want to run the business. So that\u2019s kind of where our learnings have taken. I hope that helps. Gail Glazerman - UBS: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Philip NG. Philip Ng - Jefferies: One of your competitors just reported and he sounded a little more upbeat on demand for October based on Tim\u2019s tone it sounds like more the same. So I just want to get some color on that front. Mark Sutton : Yeah. We are looking at our October. We came out about where we thought we\u2019re going to and kind of in line with what we saw in September. So I would say that it\u2019s fairly consistent, not a big direction one way or the other. Philip Ng - Jefferies: That\u2019s helpful. And then on the MLP front, as you guys elect to move forward. Carol, can you provide some color how are you thinking about using the cash proceeds? And you commented on why you would move forward be creating value for shareholders. So can you help us understand strategically what\u2019s the game plan on an MLP if you guys do move forward? Carol Roberts : Yeah, Philip, that\u2019s a great question. And I am not sure this is the right forum to answer it, but clearly one of the things that happens if you went down that path is you would be getting a big influx of cash to International Paper. Now what we do with that cash and where we take that, I mean that\u2019s the question that we continue to think about herein with Mark and the team. So I am not prepared to answer that question, but the multiple arbitrage is really the key thing that enables the flow of that cash in. Philip Ng - Jefferies: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just switching gear to Ilim, you saw some price slippage in the quarter. Is that starting to stabilize and how should we be thinking about the cadence of the EBIT progression of that business, especially considering the ramp up for production is going to be pretty close to full production year end? Carol Roberts : Phil, this is Carol. And I think on the appendix slide where we had Ilim in there and I am going to go to it pretty quickly if I can. I think what you see there is you see some whole price down quarter-over-quarter. There is a lot of mix in that for Ilim. Philip Ng - Jefferies: Okay. Carol Roberts : It\u2019s got hardwood in it. It\u2019s got different grades of the softwood, different quality grades. So I would not react to that too strongly. I think the markets are pretty strong and pretty stable. And we feel pretty good about the outlook for softwood pulp. Philip Ng - Jefferies: Okay. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chip Dillon. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Thank you very much. First question is on your view toward what maybe CapEx looks like in 2015. I know you probably haven\u2019t finished your budgeting, but at least maybe directionally as you look at some of the projects or the pipeline how could that look versus this year? Carol Roberts : Well, Chip, I would say that it is a little early to predict that. When we do the fourth quarter results and we talk about those in late January, we will give some color on that. But I would say that generally speaking, we have a pipeline of really good ideas that we need to think about how do we want to fund those ideas that are some really some good value creating opportunities. And when the time comes, we will speak to those. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And at least versus expectations and modeling, we need to give the white paper business a little bit of credit this quarter. It looked very good. And I had a question on that segment. One concern a lot of investors have had has been the impact of imports that seem to have stopped some of the pricing momentum this year. And some of the import increases of course have come from Brazil and we were just kind of wondering, it would make a lot of sense that you guys might have sent a lot of paper up from you operations down there with the Courtland closure. And maybe with the benefit of hindsight not all of those tons were necessarily needed or customers have made other arrangements. Do you see the import situation changing at all, especially given the freight costs and the distances involved from other countries? Tim Nicholls : Hey, Chip, it\u2019s Tim. Let me just tackle imports in general first and I will come back to Brazil. Imports in general, if you go back and you look at 2013 data kind of quarter by quarter or month by month, imports had started coming in the first half of last year. And as we were making decisions about our system and our footprint here, we were taking to account what imports we are doing and what customers were telling us their intentions were about additional imports. Now having said that, you referenced freight costs and they are definitely up and that has a big impact on the viability of imports, especially if they go up and they stay there for a long period of time as does currency. But the other piece of it is just supply chain, its not uncommon to be managing the supply chain that might be four or five months long, given imports and where they have to come from and the planning that goes into it versus 30 days or 40 days from domestic supplier like ourselves. With regards to Brazil, we do not import paper into the U.S. -- for distribution in the U.S. from Brazil. We do send paper here to traders that take it back out and distribute it for us in the Latin American region. And reason we do that is because of customer mix in some cases and because of quantities that are ordered. So it\u2019s just more efficient for us to ship into Miami and have it redistribute it back out into the regions, because our partner manages a very efficient supply chain and it is for us to try to do all of that ourselves. We have some direct shipments into South American region but we also go through distribution as well. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And one last quick one, I think, Mark, you mentioned that you had done all the first original authorization in terms of the buyback, except for $100 million and just a clarification, was that as of September 30th or as of for example today? Mark Sutton : Chip, if I could before that question is answered. Just on the imports into Miami, you should keep in mind that there are other imports that come into that part of the U.S. for redistribution as well. So everything that comes into, say the Port of Miami or on the West Coast into some of the southern ports, it doesn\u2019t all stay here necessarily. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : And I guess, those would both be shown in the AF and PA data as imports and exports? Mark Sutton : Not always. No. That\u2019s the problem. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. Mark Sutton : \u2026 because of the way reporting is done. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : I see. Tom Kadien : On your question about the share buyback, the $1.4 billion actual against the $1.5 billion authorizations through today. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Chercover. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: Thank you. Good morning. First question, the margins in North Americans container board are really terrific and you\u2019ve said, you intend to maintain that? As one, A, how much run rate do you have on that optimization plan, and B, is it possible that it get too good because folks lower margins can still earn their cost of capital? Tim Nicholls : Hi. Steve, it is Tim. Too good, I think, it depends on how, where the improvement comes from, so we said, earlier this year that optimization was going to take us a couple of maybe two to three years. If it\u2019s internal improvement than I think, it\u2019s probably more sustainable than if it comes from other places. Having said that, you look at -- just take a broader chunk of time because third quarter was wide on outages. You can still see margin and expansion, and I think, that\u2019s coming from how we run the box system, how we\u2019re managing supply chain. What\u2019s not coming through, just yet, but I think, its coming over the near-term is the mill system. We were better in the mills and we did perform well in the quarter, but some of the mills were acquired. We know have reliability issues and those reliability issues cost us and we\u2019re underway correcting those. But it also has an impact on supply chain too, because when you can\u2019t produce product in he mill of choice based on geography, it causes you to sub-optimize the system. So I say it playing out just as we characterized it in the past over the next couple of years. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: Okay. And switching gears, I imagine you got to be rather frustrated with what\u2019s going on in Asia or China specifically, I mean, year in year out there is really no contributions. So I\u2019m wondering how long you tolerate that or is there a means by which you could maybe extract your capital? Mark Sutton :  So, Steve, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s frustrating to, especially for our team on the ground there to deal with difficult market conditions, but we\u2019re in these businesses for the long-term, and if and when we would make a decision that we don\u2019t think, we can get to a position that we like, then we\u2019d be prepare to talk about strategic changes. But I think this is a time where as leaders of the company, you have to have perseverance, you have to take the long view and we have a company that\u2019s not everything is going to be hitting on all cylinders that the exact same time. So, I think, we will continue to evaluate our businesses around the globe and in North America, and that\u2019s just part of our role to make sure that we continue to stay flexible and nimble and position the company for the future. And the Asian markets are in a little bit of a downturn right now, but there\u2019s a lot of future potential in those market for paper and forest products companies and a lot of other industries. So we have a modest position there by all measures and we will continue to evaluate. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: Okay. And just forgive me. It\u2019s terrific that you\u2019ve executed as you have on the repo? Did you reop that, I think you did. Carol Roberts : Yeah. Steve, we did. We -- the Board authorized an additional $1.5 billion in July. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: I thought so. Thanks for assisting my senior moment. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to MLP point, obviously, the IRS and the moratorium but once that\u2019s lifted, if hypothetically you were to get a favorable ruling on the PLR? I mean, do you think you\u2019ve done enough work around what the structure would look like operationally, where you can say that you're comfortable that if you could get a favorable PLR from the IRS, you would move towards MLP structure for the containerboard business? Mark Sutton : Alex, I think it\u2019s probably premature to get into that. I mean, as I said in the beginning and Carol elaborated on. We\u2019re still working through it. So, I think at the appropriate time in the process, we would be able to talk more about that. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s fair, Mark. And then would you be able to tell us, what\u2019s your box shipments were in October. And just a follow-on to that question, if I look at last year, there was a meaningful step-up in the downtime for the North American industrial business in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Can you give us a sense of how we should be thinking about that number this year? Tim Nicholls : Hey, Alex, this is Tim. Our October shipments, we are still wrapping up the months. So if we just look at daily cut-off and how we performed in our box plans, I think it feels a lot like September and we finished on a little bit stronger in September than the rest of the quarter. In terms of outage, we don't forecast going forward. We have to look and see what our demand signal looks like and then we plan accordingly. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs : Appreciate the color, Tim. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup: Good morning. I had a question on input costs. You took a hit from higher wood costs, but OCC prices have been really weak and understanding that you're not giving guidance. As you look forward, do you think that we could be -- do you expect the OCC to pick up, or could we be looking at another 6 months, 12 months for OCC as a $100 or below $100? And is the price of OCC is something that concerns you from the perspective of potentially incenting new containerboard capacity in the U.S.? Carol Roberts : Anthony, this is Carol. I think, speaking for the team, I think the OCC, it would be very difficult for us to predict where OCC is in six months because there is going to be really all around global demand and global economic activity. So, I think what you're seeing there is just a sheer result of the demand for OCC. But over time, we are convinced that it will cost more in the future than it cost today. And so we think it goes up higher through time. And if you're making a decision on a containerboard machine, recycled containerboard machine, you\u2019re not going to make it on the stock price on OCC. You\u2019re going to make it over a long-term decision around, what do I have to pay for my input materials, what am I going to sell my products and importantly whom I going to sell it to. And that\u2019s the strategic question that any investor would have to make around on your containerboard machine. And I think, I answered your question but if there was another one in there, I\u2019ve had my own senior moment, I can't recall it. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup: No. That was -- I think you covered it. That was helpful. And then just maybe following up on North American box markets and specifically box prices, I mean, you saw stable box prices in the quarter, talked about October looking good. Some trade publications have talked about discounting in boxes. And I\u2019m just wondering, if you\u2019ve seen any of that kind of discounting in the marketplace in a real way? Or if you could just talk about competitive conditions in North American box markets, maybe how they\u2019ve changed, if they\u2019ve changed in the last three, four months? Tim Nicholls : Hi. It\u2019s Tim. We were relatively flat in the quarter and we don\u2019t forecast price going forward. But this is a seasonally slower period of time and it\u2019s a competitive market. So we will update you when we get through the fourth quarter. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson. Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Thanks. Good morning everyone. Congratulations on your performance in the quarter and Mark, best of luck in your new role. One on export. In terms of the export price weakness that you are guiding to in the fourth quarter, how much of that would you say seasonal versus reflective of current conditions, and how would you characterize export conditions, just a moment given the recent strength in U.S. dollar and the weakness in a number of economies as I think, Carol talked about earlier. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Hi, it\u2019s Tim. It really depends on what projects you are talking about. If it\u2019s containerboard, there is an element of seasonality in that. There\u2019s how regions are producing around the world and then there is -- as I mentioned earlier, some capacities that\u2019s probably left, North America and it\u2019s finding its way to other parts of the world, So probably half and half. On the paper side, this is a seasonally slower period of time and we usually do see some export price erosion. As we go to the fourth quarter in certain parts of the world, as I mentioned in Brazil, the fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally stronger period. So overall, it\u2019s probably going to be down but I don\u2019t expect big decreases. Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks, Tim. And just one on the capacity -- containerboard capacity additions in North America. How would you characterize the impact that they\u2019ve had, both on your business and on the market? Obviously, your margins in North America industrial packaging are as high as they have ever been, but we continue to read about pricing pressure, both domestically and in terms of export containerboard prices. Thanks very much. Mark Sutton : Sure. I wouldn\u2019t comment on how it impacts the market. I can tell you how it\u2019s impacted us. We haven\u2019t seen a big impact on volume. And I think you have to keep in mind that all of this capacity is not the same. You\u2019ve got different levels of quality in some cases and you\u2019ve also got basis weights that are fit for use, not necessarily more broadly applicable to all segments. And you\u2019ve got geographies in some cases. They come and play as well. So we haven\u2019t seen a big volume impact. We run a very large system that has a lot of channel access across different channels with a lot of different products. So we bring a different type of value proposition to our customers that some of these new capacity starting up just can\u2019t because of what they have to offer. Adam Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thanks, Tim. Operator :  Our next question is from the line of Debbie Jones. Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank :  Hi. Good morning. My first questions, just like to talk about OCC for a minute. Just recognizing it\u2019s difficult to kind of predict this. Do you have any thoughts on the trajectory for recycle fiber pricing and I know on recent call you\u2019ve mentioned China having less of reliance on the U.S. has been an issue. What kind of trends should we be thinking about over the near term on OCC pricing? Mark Sutton : Well, Carol gave an answer a minute ago that I would be hard to contradict. She said it\u2019s really hard to point where OCC goes over the longer period of time. I think that\u2019s right. It depends on what the level of demand in China is going to be and other parts of world. Tim Nicholls : So Debbie, let me see if I can help, maybe more satisfying -- a little more satisfying. There is a cost curve for OCC, collection cost curve and you start getting into below $100 and you start to take a fly out of the market place because the cost more to collect and it does the selling price. And so I think if you think about where it is today, the trajectory ought to be up with any kind of economic improvement across the world. So there is tax over the bracket when it becomes uneconomical to collect the high cost OCC. Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. Apologies. I guess from my senior moment in the repeat question I guess -- my follow-up I guess would be on MLPs -- it\u2019s more of the process question. If you could comment on this, you submit the application and I\u2019m assuming you are trying to get having review various craft assets and whether or not they have MLP qualifying incoming. The IRS, what type of due diligence do they do when you submit the PLR? Are they actually coming out and visiting your operations or do they tend to look at kind of industry definition and things like that? Carol Roberts : Debbie, this is Carol. I\u2019m not aware that they would come, do a visit. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what they would do. And I think they would base it upon your submission of the fact that you represented and they could always research those facts and verify those were performed by point of view. Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Great. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it over. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Good morning. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Just looking at your corrugated shipments in the quarter. I realized West of the Rockies, you are more heavily exposed to the agricultural markets. But I think I recall before you are going to try to maybe mitigate some of that by moving it to some other end markets. One, are you making any progress moving into other end markets and two, as we go into 2015, I mean, it\u2019s look like some of those issue in the ag market aren\u2019t going abate. Are there any measures you could take to sort of change your customer mix there to mitigate some of that some of those issues? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Hi. It\u2019s Tim. I\u2019m not sure about the question around the market segment shifts and what not. I mean we\u2019re talking about a lot of volume. We\u2019re talking about a big market in California. So it\u2019s really hard to impact that on the meaningful way in short term and I don\u2019t how long the drought is going to last. And you would think that at some point the drought situation will reverse itself and we\u2019ll see some uplift on the comfortable basis but what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re competing in all the segments that we play in. We\u2019ve got big protein segments. We\u2019ve got big segment and processed foods. And so we\u2019re working all of those segments hard across the country and we\u2019re faced in the last, situation where there is just not -- there is much demand because the product not there to be packaged. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Okay. But working at your shipments there versus the industry, you\u2019re down 3.7% industry at 1% of that. Is that purely overweighting towards ag or is there something else going on? Mark Sutton : Yeah. Sorry. I missed that part of your question. Maybe my senior moment, yeah, I mean there is more than just ag in the west in the industrial business. But we tend to be overweighted to the ag segment in that part of the country? Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Right. Is that something where maybe an acquisition would help you to balance out the end market exposure there? Tim Nicholls : I don\u2019t think you look at acquisitions for situational factors that impact demand. We\u2019re running our business and we would look at the way Carol talked about if there was one that made sense. And we thought the growth in intrinsic value but we\u2019re running the business day-to-day and trying to optimize what we have. Mark Sutton : Okay. Got the biggest lever we had as Tim mentioned earlier is the channel distribution strategy that we have, domestic containerboard in the open market where we have top notch customers, our own box business and of course our export markets. And that allows us to move containerboard through this channel. So at the West Coast ag business is difficult while we\u2019ve got other outlets and that\u2019s what we do on the ongoing basis. It\u2019s really maximize our flow through through different channels to market because all of those channels are permanent channels for IP that we viewed strategically. Tim Nicholls : And as I mentioned, we don\u2019t expect the ag segment on the West Coast to be down for ever. It will comeback. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Right. Now I hear on that argument. We\u2019ve been just waiting for above average harvest around food can for three or four years now. So\u2026 Tim Nicholls : Right. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : That\u2019s where the concern is coming from there. Just moving over to consumer for a minute on cup stock, can you talk about any continued improvement in the uptick there? On -- I think may be you are adding some capacity but also from a consumer -- from a customer demand perspective, are you seeing any continued switch from phone to paper? Tom Kadien : Yes, Scott this is Tom Kadien. We see robust demand growth in our food service business. And we are I think our volumes are up high single-digits year-over-year and we still have customers who are moving geographies and moving products out of foam and into paper and that\u2019s driving our volumes that\u2019s why we are expanding Canton, Ohio plant to add capacity for the back half next year because we still see that trend moving in our direction and that\u2019s pulling through a lot of cups talk through our coated board business as well. Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Al Kabili. Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities : All right. Thanks. Good morning. Carol just housekeeping question for you is on the pension. If you had any preliminary thoughts around what the lower discount rate and change in mortality tables might mean for your pension expense next year more broadly and also as how you define operational pension expense? Carol Roberts : So, Al, good morning. So on pension, let me just comment from clearly the discount rate as of December 31st will impact the accounting side of the pension, it will not impact the cash required contribution side. The law that got passed legislation of the summer will trump all of that and the required contribution that we are looking at now for '15 and '16 is in aggregate probably round number a $100 million in totalish. So it's a very small amount. So the impact on the discount rate will be a balance sheet and a credit metric issue by itself. Relative to the mortality table, they will come in, they're not sure of the exact day when all that hits, but I thinks its '16 or '17, some thing like that. And clearly when the lifespan is longer, the liability will go up from that, but we -- I am not prepared to give any preliminary math on that. And then the operating pension expense which you referred to that flows through the business P&L. Operating pension expense is really the cost of providing that benefit, taking out the kind of swings that come from the accounting. So it\u2019s a benefit that we provide to our employees. There is cost associated with that and that flows through the businesses. On the non-operating, it\u2019s the kind of things like the change in liability, the change in interest rates, all that kind of stuff that\u2019s really accounting driven. And that\u2019s why we separated the two not to distort our operating performance. Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities : Right. And understanding you are not prepared to give the change in mortality table update just yet as far as quantifying. But it sounds like it\u2019s probably not going to have that much of an impact on the operating pension expense if I understand it correctly, Carol? Carol Roberts : No, I will tell you the truth that we have done it more from an overall liability perspective. We have not moved it back through to the operating line, but it certainly won't be an impact in '15 and I think it would become an impact in '16, '17. And I don\u2019t think it will be. Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities : Okay. Appreciate it. Understood. Okay. And then just last question. Just more broadly on to the team and just the emerging markets. And clearly the macro has been a struggle, but if we look at India and we look at Brazil or so, those businesses have been challenged by cost inflation the last few years. And I wanted to just get a sense to the pulse on the opportunity just to improve the performance next year on those businesses irrespective of the macro and just catching up to some of those cost inflation what the outlook is there? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. Just on Brazil and then I'll pass it off to Tom Kadien for India or so. Yes, the environment is challenging, but even with the challenging environment this past quarter we were still getting price increases. The big level for us is really around cost structure, especially in the box plans. We\u2019re spending low capital dollars or significant automation opportunities that takes out headcount. So will end up taking out this year probably the better part of our 160 people across the system. And we think there is more opportunity as you go into 2015. On the volume side, if you look at the business absent these three multinational customers that we have that have lost share, we\u2019re kind of holding our own. We are just faced with the additional challenge of in a soft market trying to replace the tons that we\u2019ve lost through those customers. But I think we are making headway on it. So I expect an improved fourth quarter from a margin standpoint. Third quarter was very heavy to outages, which impacted us and expanding margins of '15, '16. Mark Sutton : And on the India side, there is a lot of optimism in India right now with the changing government and we\u2019ve seen some tangible signs that give us optimism as well about the macro environment. We expect demand -- our GDP to drive demand and GDP is going to increase next year over the issuers 5.5% or what for so. Fiber prices which have been an issue are coming down. So that spells good for earnings. And we\u2019ve also gotten -- with this new government, we\u2019ve gotten some consents approved on additional capacity that will help us grow the business next year. So we feel really pretty upbeat about our paper business in India. Al Kabili - Macquarie Securities : Okay. Terrific and good luck the remainder of the year. Mark Sutton : Okay. I think that will wrap us up here. I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. At IP, we expect to continuously improve. We hold ourselves as leaders accountable for that. We are going to focus on our customers. It\u2019s even more important than slow economic times to really redouble our efforts to be better and better with customers. We will continue to focus on improvement and how we operate. You saw a lot of the evidence of being able to do that and bring it to the bottomline in the third quarter. Our focus on good sustainable cash flow will remain. And balanced use of that cash that rewards our shareholders will be the principles that we continue to operate going forward. We have great group of employees that are engaged in winning and winning with customers and outperforming the competition all over the world. And it\u2019s a privilege for me to have the opportunity to lead International Paper. And I look forward to speaking with all of you on a regular basis going forward. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Mark. And thanks again to all of you for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Rachel and I will be available after the call. Our phone numbers are on slide 20 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2014 International Paper Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now the transfer this call over to your host, Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the Fourth Quarter and 2014 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. What I would like to do is quickly go over the format that we\u2019ll follow this morning. In the beginning, I\u2019ll review our Full Year 2014 results, and then turn it over to Carol Roberts to speak to the fourth quarter and the performances of our individual businesses. And then we\u2019ll come back and cover the first quarter and 2015 outlook before opening it up to questions.  So I am on slide five looking at 2014 full-year results. International Paper completed a strong year in 2014. We delivered record cash flow from operations of $3.4 billion along with free cash flow of $2.1 billion. North American Industrial Packaging results were significant with the business achieving $2.7 billion in EBITDA and margins of 24%. Return on Invested Capital was 9.2% making this the fifth consecutive year that our returns have exceeded our cost of capital. And additionally we saw margin expansion across all of our key businesses in 2014. We conducted a successful debt restructuring program in which we pushed out a billion dollars of debt from 2018 and 2019. And we achieved more than $40 million in annualized interest savings as a result. In the fall, we increased our dividend by 14% to $1.60 per share, which was the third year in a row of double-digit dividend increases. For the year we bought back roughly $1 billion of IP stocks at a little over $47 a share. We completed the closure of the Courtland Alabama printing papers mill, which, as we\u2019ve mentioned was very difficult for us to do, especially with the impact on our employees. But we believe, it was necessary given the ongoing decline in North American uncoated free sheet demands. We completed the spinoff of our North American Distribution business xpedx and received $400 million as it became part of the new publicly traded company Veritiv. And the Russian JV, Ilim, which we own 50% had a solid year improving operational EBITDA by a 126% to $470 million for the full year. And we received a dividend of $56 million in 2014 from Ilim. Turning to the full-year financial results, IP achieved solid improvement across the board. Full year earnings-per-share finished at $3 per share and included in this figure is $0.63 of Ilim FX negative impact. Absent this impact our EPS was up 20% year-over-year and we\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute.  Turning to slide seven, which is a history of our Return on Invested Capital. As I mentioned for 2014 our return was 9.2%, again the fifth year in a row that we're above cost of capital. We continue to deliver on our commitment to create value for our shareholders. I\u2019d also note that if you consider the impact to the equity earnings of the Ilim FX charge I mentioned earlier, which was a non-cash charge, our ROIC would have been over 10% for 2014 and that would have been a best ever mark for the company. Turning to slide eight, 2014\u2019s free cash flow of $2.1 billion continued a strong trend of free cash flow results since 2008. Beyond strong earnings from the businesses, our cash flow performance in 2014 benefited from strong working capital management in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we remain confident that IP can continue to deliver strong free cash flow in the years ahead. And turning to the uses of that cash, we continue to do what we said we would do. In total, we returned $1.6 billion or more than 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders throughout 2014. And additionally, we finished the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion.  And with that overview of the full year, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol and then I'll return later to talk about the outlook and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Carol? Carol Roberts : Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Turning to slide ten, looking at the year-over-year bridge for 2014, you can see year-over-year price improvement was significant at $0.89 with about 60% of this coming from our North American Industrial Packaging business, 30% from Printing Papers and the balance came from our Consumer Packaging segment. In aggregate volume was down and this was mostly due to the volume decline in North American Printing Papers as Mark said largely driven by the Courtland mill shutdown. Overall our operations performed well for the year. Looking at input costs, they were a $141 million higher due to the stubbornly and consistently high wood costs that we saw throughout the year.  Energy costs were higher as well, largely driven by the very low levels that we saw in 2013 and also impacted by the significant weather that we experienced in the first quarter of 14, and the lingering impact that, that had on energy costs through the first half of the year. These were partially offset by lower chemical costs. Taxes were higher in 2014 by about 5% and that was due to fewer tax benefits in 14 versus what we experienced in 2013. And finally we had a significant non-cash Ilim FX hit in 2014 as Mark pointed out of $0.63 per share. But most importantly we saw a substantial improvement in the business, in the operations as you can see in the call-out box.  And this is attributable to the continued post project ramp up as well other efficiency improvements and margin expansion that resulted in operational EBITDA more than doubling from the prior year. So as Mark stated when you exclude the Ilim non-cash FX charge we enjoyed an EPS improvement of more than 20% in 2014. Turning to the results for the fourth quarter, as Mark said IP delivered record free cash flow for the year and it was no different in the quarter with $739 million of free cash flow. And this came from solid performance across all our key businesses, as well as strong working capital management in the quarter.  We benefited from stronger North American Box demand, but this was muted by weaker global conditions in a number of our segments. We did see some benefit from lower input costs in the quarter and operating results at the Ilim JV were strong. Although as we said the JV did experience a large non-cash FX charge of $0.40 in the quarter itself, and this reduced our fourth-quarter EPS to $0.53 per share. Additionally, we repurchased a 170 million of our shares in the fourth quarter bringing the total purchases since September of 2013 to $1.44 billion. Moving to slide twelve, taking a look at the quarter-over-quarter bridge I\u2019ll highlight a few key items. On volume, results were better for the quarter as the North American Box volume exceeded our expectations on stronger daily demand. Operations and cost were unfavorable quarter-over-quarter largely due to some isolated issues at a few of our mills in the US. The issue we had at our mill in France and an issue we had at one of our mills in Brazil. Additionally the fourth quarter is typically a more expensive operating quarter due to the onset of colder weather and some other seasonal costs that we see. Transportation rates across all our North American businesses were higher due to tight rail and truck markets. And year end true-up expenses were higher in the quarter as well.  Regarding corporate expenses there was a non-cash FX charge for the administrative restructuring of an international entity for which we took a one-time hit. As I said Ilim operational results improved in the quarter while we also experienced the large negative non-cash FX charge associated with JV US denominated debt. As I mentioned on the prior slide, EPS for the quarter would have been $0.40 higher in the absence of this non-cash FX impact. So turning to Industrial Packaging on slide thirteen, despite three fewer shipping days in the quarter volume was flat as the daily rate for box demand was at its strongest level of the year. Pricing and aggregate was down slightly, primarily driven by pressure on exports due to seasonality and a weaker euro. Operations were unfavorable for the quarter primarily driven by isolated issues at our Orange, Texas and Newport, Indiana mills. And as I mentioned transportation costs were higher as well as truck and rail rates increased due to pretty -- a very tight market condition. We also experienced higher benefit costs and other expenses due to some year-end true ups, and we had several one-off expenses that at our Brazil Packaging business. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well, but we had clearly expected that. And then finally on input costs, they were modestly lower as we saw lower expenses for energy, OCC and diesel that were offset by some higher utility costs. And we had a major event at the steam provider for our Newport, Indiana mill that resulted in our need to pay some premium pricing for energy to sustain mill operations throughout the quarter.  I think slide fourteen is just a great picture which shows the track record of results that we've been able to achieve in our North American Industrial Packaging business for the last ten years. In 2014 the business achieved $2.7 billion in EBITDA, 24% margins. We're very proud of this business and of all of our colleagues in the Industrial Packaging business, and the job they have done to achieve, sustain, and build on these industry-leading results. And this has really been done through delivering real value to our customers, great operating performance and quite honestly a commitment to excellence and to continue to improve.  Moving to Consumer Packaging, seasonally lower demand in solid operating performance and a desire to manage our inventories very closely resulted in the need for some market-related downtime in the quarter to match production to our customers\u2019 demand. Results were also impacted by higher maintenance outage expenses and some unfavorable FX impact in our European and China business. The business did see some benefit from lower input costs for wood, energy and fuel. Moving on to Printing Papers on slide sixteen, volume was seasonally stronger in Brazil and Russia. Pricing and mix were slightly unfavorable for the quarter as less favorable pulp mix and pricing pressure in Europe were partially offset by a seasonally stronger mix in Brazil. Maintenance outages were higher as expected and operations were unfavorable due to higher operating expenses in North American papers, and higher costs associated with reliability issues at our Mogi Gua\u00e7u mill in Brazil and our Saillat mill in France. Higher year-end benefit costs in Brazil impacted our results as well. And once again as in the other businesses input costs were favorable on our Paper segment. Slide seventeen kind of highlights IP\u2019s year-over-year change in operating profits by region for the Printing Papers business. In North America Printing Papers improved by $2 million which you have to point out is significant when you consider the $40 million charge of additional expenses that we incurred in 2014 related to the Courtland closure. The North American Pulp business had a good year with improved earnings of $55 million driven by higher volume, improved operations and improved pricing and mix associated with a higher percentage of Fluff Pulp.  Brazil was flat, really not surprising given the economic headwinds we\u2019ve experienced there. And Europe was down $27 million on less favorable pricing and mix, higher input costs partially offset by lower outage expenses. Earnings in India improved $10 million year-over-year driven by improved pricing and lower operational and maintenance outage expenses.  Now turning to the Ilim JV on slide eighteen, a good quarter of operating and margin performance which was offset by the large non-cash FX charge related to the JV\u2019s US dollar-denominated debt. Volume was up 12% for the quarter, operational EBITDA increased to a $143 million. When looking at the full-year results, volume was up 19% to almost 3.2 million tons. Operational EBITDA improved from $208 million in 2013 to $470 million in 2014. These improvements were largely attributable to the ramp-up of the major JV funded capital projects of both at the Koryazhma mill and the Bratsk mill as well as other efficiency improvements made by the Ilim team.  Due to the significant devaluation of the ruble, which we saw late in the fourth quarter, the JV expects to see further margin expansion in the first quarter. And again simply put, most of our costs, 95% of our costs are in rubles, and 65% of our sales are in dollars, which gives us this opportunity for margin expansion. It is worth noting that with that devaluation of the currency, we will see rising inflation in 2015 and that also has a potential to create some pressure on pulp pricing. So it will be very important for the team at Ilim to closely manage operations and costs as they go into 2015. As we step back and look at the many reasons we like our investment in Ilim, our partnership with Ilim at the top of the list is how the JV is so well positioned to serve the most significant and fastest growing pulp market in the world, China. The JV\u2019s pulp operations in Siberia are uniquely located with favorable access to the vast Russian wood basket and importantly with access to mainland China by rail, a straight south from where the mill sits. The JV will benefit from the recent significant devaluation in the ruble which has positioned the softwood pulp operation as the lowest cost on the globe. And there's more potential as we continue to improve the operational performance of the business.  So before I turn to the outlook I\u2019d like to give you an update on our balance sheet. And some of the impacts that we've had are due to the lower discount rates along with a change to mortality tables that came about last year and that we\u2019ve implemented into our liability accounting. We did see our pension gap grow to $3.9 billion as of the end of 2014. In the year we made roughly a $350 million in required pension contributions. And this contribution looks to be maybe about a $100 million in 2015, not yet totally decided but certainly much less than what we had previously anticipated.  As you recall, we executed a significant bond issue and tender offer that Mark mentioned this year that enabled us to move out about a billion dollars of debt from 18 and 19 which were our largest towers along with realizing roughly a $40 million annualized interest saving. And we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion.  So on twenty one, turning to the outlook for the first quarter. Volume will be largely flat across most of our businesses with the exception of Russia and Brazil, where there is a normal seasonal decrease. The seasonal decrease in Brazil is coming off of the strongest quarter of the year, which is the fourth quarter. And this typically will result in about a third less volume for Brazil domestically, so about a $30 million negative swing quarter-over-quarter. We expect pricing to be fairly stable across most geographies with the exception of Europe, where pressure continues in the paper side due to continued economic challenges.  We expect improved operating performance in North American Industrial Packaging as the isolated issues we experienced in the fourth quarter are behind us. And we have a similar expectation for improved performance at our Mogi Gua\u00e7u mill in Brazil as well as the Saillat mill in France. We do expect some modest offsets from North American Consumer Package as operation and costs move back to a more typical first-quarter level. Input costs should trend favorably due to lower energy and fuel costs, but we are seeing some offset of that due to increasing transportation rates, due to the tight conditions both in the rail and the truck markets. And energy consumption in North America will be higher as well due to the normal winter condition. Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase in the quarter, $14 million. We assume operations at the Ilim JV will continue to perform favorably and as usual we are not attempting to forecast the ruble. The assumption of flat FX coming out of the fourth quarter would result in a $0.40 positive swing for the first quarter. But based upon what we're seeing to date, there's likely some additional negative impact in the first quarter depending on how the ruble ends the quarter. And we expect the tax rate to increase modestly to 33% on higher US earnings in the absence of tax extenders which we saw in the fourth quarter of 14. And finally we expect corporate expense to return to the normalized rate of roughly $15 million in the quarter. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Carol. I am on slide twenty two now and what I would like to do is make a couple of comments about how we see 2015 as we enter the year. You know I\u2019d like to turn your attention to the slide, and it\u2019s a lot of information on the slide. Basically what we're trying to do here is take a look at growth rates, GDP rates in the regions that we operate comparing them, 15 to 14. And as you can see from the chart we see a few more headwinds and tailwinds. But a reminder, 80% plus of our EBITDA is generated in the US, and we see a stronger US market. So that really helps a lot in North America. This is the market that drives our results, and we saw in a number of businesses some improved demand environment as we exited 2014. In the markets that are most challenged as we enter 2015, Carol spoke about Russia and the challenges domestically in Russia. However, with our leverage as an exporter we think we can navigate that environment. We didn\u2019t talk a lot about Brazil, but Brazil is in a difficult position right now. Again our paper businesses in Brazil is well positioned to win in those markets. We provide product in Brazil, but also in the region.  Our packaging business is mostly about Brazil and of course that will be more impacted, but we do see some improvement opportunities there. And the bottom line is we\u2019ve built a company that's got exposure in a number of markets. We're nimble, we're ready and able to deal with a variety of macro conditions that might occur in any given year and we will work very hard to offset headwinds in one area with hopefully tailwinds in another. As we turn to our expectations for 2015, we see continued progress and strong results despite the macro environment that I just described as remaining challenging. As we showed earlier in the presentation deck, we delivered consistently strong results in both ROIC and free cash flow for the last several years. And I believe we will do the same again in 2015. We see the opportunity to grow our EBITDA by roughly 5% by executing the plans we currently have in place for our key businesses. Along with this expected increase in EBITDA, free cash flow is likely to be impacted by things like higher cash taxes as a result of higher earnings from the US operations I talked about, also as a result of changing and lower tax credits and a few non-repeat deductible events. Relative to how we're thinking about CapEx, our target for 2015 is 1.5 billion. The intent is to continue to find a higher percentage of our high-return projects that will enable IP to continue to grow earnings, free cash flow and our returns. Some recent examples of these higher return projects are our foodservice expansion in Kenton, Ohio and the restart of our Valliant number three paper machine which we shared with you in a prior quarter. So thinking about the key leverage that will enable the EBITDA growth for 2015, here are a few I\u2019d like to highlight and I am on slide twenty four. We\u2019ve a great opportunity to continue to optimize the North American Industrial Packaging system with the ramp down of our DOJ required purchases from the mills that we divested as part of the Temple-Inland acquisition, and the restart of the Valliant machines.  Those two events allow us to optimize our system even further and again we mentioned this before but I\u2019ll restate it. It\u2019s not about volume growth as much as it is about enhanced flexibility across a very large system which will enable us to serve the customer needs we\u2019ve at a lower total delivered cost. So we\u2019ve opportunities to grow kraft liner through our international box system. We\u2019ve talked about that in prior discussions. We still see opportunity there in specialty applications like paper that's required for gypsum board, which we also make in our containerboard system is growing and all of this flexibility allows us to bring the best revenue stream in through the asset base we\u2019ve.  The Courtland shutdown and transition are complete and we\u2019ll realize the benefits of this repositioning for the North American Printing Papers business while the costs are largely behind us from 2014. There is a growing trend in demand for fiber-based food packaging that we see in the move from foam to paper cups as an example, and the growing plate segment, just to name a few. And we're well-positioned to benefit from these demand trends. And we expect to see solid improvement in results in our Brazil Industrial Packaging business. We're well-positioned to benefit from continued margin expansion that Carol outlined in our Ilim JV.  So before we go to questions, I would just like to conclude by saying you know 2014 was a strong year for IP and a lot was accomplished. I feel good about how we performed and the momentum we\u2019ve going into 2015. We again delivered strong results and created value for our shareholders and that's our commitment. We're off to a good start in 2015. I am excited about the prospects for another strong year. We\u2019ve every opportunity to deliver on the outlook I just shared with you, and our team is engaged in committing to doing it. 2015 is all about execution and that's something we pride ourselves on really continuing to improve on.  In addition, we intend to focus more resources on high-return capital projects within our core businesses that can drive additional earnings growth. And finally our team is committed to continue to find ways to deliver the most value for shareholders. And as such, we will continue to evaluate all of our businesses as well as our capital allocation strategy. We feel good about where we\u2019ve come from and what we've accomplished, but we're far from satisfied at this point. We expect to deliver more value in the future. And on that note, I'd like to give you a quick update on where we are with the Master Limited Partnership evaluation process.  We continue to look and work diligently on this project with our tax, financial and legal advisors. And the real question is evaluating whether the MLP structure is the best vehicle to create value for IP and our shareholders. We continue to be interested in the opportunity. While we said before it\u2019s complicated, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would say that we need to shut down the analysis so that it\u2019s a no-go. By the same token, we haven't reached a conclusion either. But since our last call we\u2019ve filed a request with the IRS to get a private letter ruling and it remains a little unclear on how that might proceed, but we will stay tuned.  Our primary goal is to create value for our shareholders and we're evaluating the MLP opportunity because it has the potential to be part of our value creation strategy. As we\u2019ve more information to share we will keep everyone informed. With that I think we're ready for questions. Question-and: Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : A few questions. You know Mark, you know, you mentioned that or the company mentioned that you expect to grow EBITDA this year about 5%, and we wish you well in that regard. And you talked to some of the drivers of that performance on slide twenty four. Would it be possible to perhaps parse how much of that growth comes from those drivers when considering in 2014 you know looking at your slides, you didn't grow EBITDA quite 5%. And that was the year where you had much more pricing tailwinds and you're likely to have in 15 at least given current trends. So you know if you could talk to those points and I had a couple of quick follow-ons. Mark Sutton : Yeah I think the outline on slide twenty four are the key drivers. I mean part of it is as I mentioned in internal execution. We still don't have a robust volume outlook in our plan, but I think we've got the opportunities in the points I made on that slide that gives us a good chance to grow that EBITDA in really internal initiatives and some of the execution issues that we have in front of us. And there is a long list of high-return capital projects that improve our quality and lower our costs that we\u2019ve discovered in the number of businesses, most recently in our -- in North American Industrial Packaging business that we plan on working on. George Staphos : Okay, but other than that and general [indiscernible] we appreciate you might not want to get into the details at this juncture not willing to parse that any further on this call? Mark Sutton : I\u2019d rather not, thank you. George Staphos : No, I understand, I understand. Secondly on pension, I think you mentioned that funding is now a $100 million for 15 and we understand why, obviously with the growth and the pension gap. At this juncture, Carol is it possible to talk about what the implications are going forward past 15? So simplistically, should we extrapolate a 100 million into the future or you know could there be some offsets that we should consider as we model out? Carol Roberts : George, actually the honest truth of it is, is you really don't know your total cash required contributions until June, because there's some more that has to be done. And so as we sit, it\u2019s not really much of a change from where we were before. It\u2019s in that range, and it all comes back to -- and very close to your funding target attainment number and you are right around 100%. If you go a little below that, you\u2019ve to put a little bit more money in. If you are above it, you don\u2019t. So it\u2019s just that we're very close to that edge is why I qualify it with a 100. But there's no real change even with the growing gap in the liability. George Staphos : My last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. I noticed, I think from the slide deck that you are projecting maintenance spending to be up, I think around $60 million in 15 versus 14. Can you comment to what the drivers are there and you know how important is that in terms of the overall execution, you know imperative if you will in 15 in terms of how you get that 5% EBITDA growth? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Carol Roberts : Yes, George this is Carol. I\u2019ll take that. Actually what\u2019s happening in 2015 and it will happen again in 2016, is there is some significant outages for the [indiscernible] implementation that requires some extra work. And so if you look at I think the numbers that are in there is $444 million of outage expense in 14 increasing to about 500. The biggest driver of that increase is the very specific work that has to go on around some of the mills that's more extensive than we normally would be see. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub, Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you, I had two questions. First I just wanted to know, are you continuing to see the strength in corrugated demand domestically as we go into January that you're seeing in the fourth quarter? And do you have any visibility as to how sustainable it is at that point? Mark Sutton : Hi, Mark. We're are seeing January starting off with a continuation of the trend we saw in November and December. So across a number of segments you know we're sort of in every segment given our scale, but we do see that continuing. I wish I could answer your second question, I would say we hope so. Some of it seems to be underpinned by the behavior of the American consumer and everything we read about with respect to the impact of lower fuel prices and you know consumer sentiment in general being better. But it\u2019s you know a couple of months, maybe not a trend yet but we are cautiously optimistic. Mark Weintraub : Thank you and then if I could try and just translate, if there is 5% growth in EBITDA, in terms of thinking about EPS is it fair for us to take this $3 and presumably, hopefully we don't have the Ilim FX issue, so we're really starting at $3.63. Then if we think about 5% is roughly 200 million, that's about another $0.30. I guess there's some movements in tax rate and interest expense and corporate, but is that kind of directionally the way to think about translating the EBITDA to an EPS number or are there other significant variables to be keeping in mind? Carol Roberts : No, Mark I think that's it. Of course you know we\u2019ve the Ilim FX issue, so that's in both, now it\u2019s in the 14, it will be something in 15. And you hit it, we gave some information on where we view the tax rate going and also the interest expense. So yes, you are directionally thinking about it correctly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman, UBS. Gail Glazerman : You took another big charge in Asia this quarter and you took a big one in India, you know within the last year. I am just wondering, does that have any -- to what extent does that reflect on how you are viewing the business potential moving forward? And also how it may or may not impact your thinking in terms of further growth and investments in the region? Carol Roberts : Yes Gail, I\u2019ll just comment on the charge. So I think it\u2019s listed in our special charges. We did take the write-off of the goodwill that was associated with our Asian Box business, the converting business. And as you pointed out, we wrote off the goodwill associated with India in the prior year. And so relative to the comments about the business and the portfolio, I\u2019ll turn that over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Carol. Good morning, Gail. Now the charges are really as Carol described. Our view on the businesses, in any of these kind of emerging markets is, it\u2019s a long view. It\u2019s a difficult time in Asia right now for a number of reasons, namely capacity issues. You know we're very small in India and we still see some potential there. So I think we do have a long view on these markets, but as we said before, and I said in my earlier comments we will continue to evaluate as time goes on almost on a continuous basis. The portfolio we're in and geographies and businesses, all against the backdrop of trying to do the things that create the most value long term. So you know we're going to continue to look at our emerging markets. Sometimes, you\u2019ve to weather some storms, and I think that's what we're going through right now. Gail Glazerman : Okay, and in terms of the coated paperboard business, can you talk about where you think we are in that process of conversion away from foam? You know are we in the third inning, the eighth inning? And just taking kind of a broader global view, you kind of just referenced some of the challenges in Asia. But anything else as you look at the business globally that gives you any concerns? Mark Sutton : Gail, Mike Amick is here and he\u2019s [indiscernible] our Consumer Packaging business and our Printing Papers business. And I\u2019ll let Mike take a shot at your question and then see if we get everything you are looking for. Mike? Mike Amick : Good morning, Gail. It\u2019s a good question. I like the analogy to the baseball. I am not sure exactly what inning, I would say we're probably early in the process. We continue to see you know very strong momentum in this space. We had a good year in foodservice and the overall demand associated with that business. But I would probably characterize it as you know, we're kind of early, you know early on in this game and probably in the first three innings. We expect to see continued improvement in this space as a result of kind of the sustainability story associated with our product line. Mark Sutton : I think Gail, on the global part of that question, you know we\u2019ve seen a lot of customer acceptance of higher grade fiber-based packaging. So we make this new product at our Kwidzyn Mill. It\u2019s been very well received. Now we are in segments of the Consumer Packaging market from a board manufacturing standpoint, not every segment. And the ones that we're in, you know we think still have some runway and still have a lot of interest by customers. Gail Glazerman : Okay and maybe that's like a little bit of a segway in my last question. Obviously earlier in [indiscernible] week we saw a big deal announced particularly perhaps in the Consumer Packaging space. Do you think it\u2019s important for you or would you consider expanding beyond into other substrates? Is that something that you feel is holding you back at all in your business? Mark Sutton : Well it\u2019s something -- it\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s something we evaluate constantly around whether or not a fuller line of products and really any of our business brings value to customers. And sometimes the best place to ask that question is in where the customer sits. And so it\u2019s something Gail we always evaluate and you will probably see from time to time that we expand our offering. You know we did it in our corrugated packaging business. But I don't see that we're in a particular disadvantaged spot right now. But it\u2019s definitely something we continue to look at as we should, as a value-creating opportunity for the company. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Philip Ng, Jefferies. Philip Ng : Can you talk a little bit about inventory levels in containerboard? You know November was pretty lean and demand trends from most of the public companies that I have reported suggested pretty strong flow-through on the demand side in the early part of year. So can you give us a little color on that trend? Mark Sutton : Philip, I would be happy to. You know demand in a quarter, expected inventory needs to service customers in the next quarter, and in the case of the first quarter you start getting the annual outages. And just how we ran and how we operate, all factor into where our inventories end up despite our best efforts on planning where we want them to be. And I think with all that said, I believe we're in good shape from an inventory standpoint. Going into 2015, our inventories went down in the quarter and we believe we\u2019ve got the systems in place to operate in the first quarter without any interruptions because our inventory is too low.  The one dynamic that we are dealing with and I think a lot of people are dealing with is the transportation network continues to be a little less flexible than it has been in the past. So that influences where we might need to see inventory levels that might be different from what they were in the past. But I think we like where we are right now. Philip Ng : Okay and Mark, you kind of referenced you know part of that [indiscernible] on 5% EBITDA type growth for 15 is partly driven by some of the high-return projects that you have going forward. Can you talk about it, if it\u2019s mostly cost takeout, is it more growth related, is it domestic, is it international? Can you give us some color on that front? Mark Sutton : I think it\u2019s a bit of -- some of the projects definitely, some projects that we\u2019ve already started in 14 that will benefit us in 15. And I think it\u2019s a mix across domestic and the outside the US businesses. But given the scale of our business, obviously most of the driver is coming from some opportunities in our North American system. There is a little bit of volume or growth I would say in there. And it\u2019s areas where we think we have the ability because of our customer portfolio to grow even in a flat-market environment. So, but the big driver is the first thing you mentioned, which is improving our cost structure and cost takeout. Philip Ng : Okay and just one final question for Carol. Can you give us some color on how you are thinking about free cash flow? I know you gave us some moving pieces on CapEx and D&A and pension contribution. But directionally, should we expect free cash flow to be roughly flat, up, down, some color on that front would be helpful? Carol Roberts : Yeah I think the -- [indiscernible] the EBITDA number out there. I think the areas you are going to see more cash used is in cash taxes. We had a number of one-off events that happened in 14 that helped lower the cash taxes that are non-repeatable. So I think we\u2019ll see more there and then we talked about the CapEx going from 1.4 to 1.5. But again if you step back from it, it\u2019s going to be another strong year of free cash flow for the company. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie. Al Kabili : And I guess a question for Carol or maybe even Tim, if he is there. It\u2019s just, you mentioned some operational issues in the Industrial Packaging side in a mill in Texas, I think in Indiana. And I was just wondering if you maybe can quantify or help us out with you know the extra costs related to that, that hopefully don't repeat there? Carol Roberts : Yeah this is Carol. Unfortunately Tim is home sick, so we got the flu running around here in Memphis. But, so I\u2019ll take a shot at it and I\u2019ll see if my colleagues can add to it? So if you think about Orange, Texas we had an outage in December. We found some issues that we chose to spend a little extra money on, and then we had a little difficulty coming up out of the outage which cost us a little production. So you\u2019ve got that item and then you take our Indiana mill where we had our supplier, our steam supplier there had a catastrophic failure at their facility, which meant that we had to pay more for both electricity and steam. And that problem was with us most of the fourth quarter and is moderating and I am looking at my colleagues. I think the swing on all of this is about $10 million to $15 million should be a pickup that we get heading from the fourth to the first. Al Kabili : Okay, thank you Carol, I appreciate that. And also in the context of the 5% EBITDA growth that we're targeting for 15, how do you -- how has inflationary expectations embedded in that? Do you see yeah, low oil prices materially you know factoring in that and helping on the inflationary front? Carol Roberts : You know that's a great question. You know we take a look at a year like 14 that we would say felt like a moderately low inflation year and yet, you know we still saw a $141 million of headwinds, so it\u2019s a big system and small moves can matter a lot. So the things that are helping us of course are energy, pull through into chemicals, diesel. Wood costs has been stubbornly high, but you know we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed. Maybe we\u2019ll see it turn there and you know OTC will depend on global economic conditions. The headwinds we have though are transportation costs are going up.  And so we\u2019ve kind of have put some cakes, so it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s going to be you know like a 100 headwind or a 100 tailwind. It\u2019s hard to predict how it will turn out. If the economic conditions stay strong, the likelihood of it being a little bit of a headwind is probably more likely and that would be a good problem. And so, we\u2019ll just have to see, so that's a round answer Al, but that's about what it feels like right now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde, Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wondered -- just kind of a broad question here. But I wondered if we could get your thoughts on the impact of FX across your portfolio as we move into 15? Mark Sutton : Yeah, that's a great question, Mark. And I think what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll ask Carol to kind of give you a high-level puts and takes across the company. Carol Roberts : Yeah Mark, you know if you look at the business and you know us well, the primary impact of FX is going to be less around the accounting conversion of profits from euro to dollars, all of that stuff. It's going to have the bigger impact, it\u2019s going to be around really the economic implications of what it does to trade flows, cost competitiveness and where people sell their products, and what we can charge for our products in different regions. If you step back from it, clearly the biggest impact is the strengthening US dollar. For us, a stronger US dollar net-net will cost us, you know it will lower our earnings. And I don't know that we've kind of given this number out before, but if you think about you know a 10% depreciation in the dollar, it could be a 15 millionish round number just from the accounting side of it. And that doesn\u2019t speak to any of the economic implications of it. So we're hedged in a lot of places. You know we\u2019ve weakening currency in Brazil and Russia, but we\u2019ve a lot of dollars sales. But the biggest impact of course is you know we export a lot from a lot of places and it will be trade flows that has the biggest impact. Mark Wilde : Just another question on a couple of the foreign operations. I wondered if you're able to give us some timeline and improvement down at Orsa. And I also wonder over at Ilim whether it\u2019s possible to give a sort of a longer-term EBITDA margin target of that business? Mark Sutton : Mark, I think on Orsa you know what I mentioned earlier is we made a lot of operational improvements as we went through the year and we expect to continue that. Where we've been challenged really is on the commercial side, and so I think we're going to take advantage of whatever the market gives us, but we expect a difficult commercial environment in the Box business in Brazil through 2015, at least with what we can see now.  But there are opportunities, continued opportunities to improve the operation of our recycle bills there and our box plans. And so I think when and I know it will happen, when the market improves we will be well positioned to take advantage of it. So I think you'll see internal improvements through 2015 and commercial improvements as the economy improves. Carol Roberts : Relative to Ilim, we still target and believe that under you know normal conditions, $600 million EBITDA is the target for the footprint and the platform we build out. And depending upon the margin on that, it\u2019s probably in your upper 20s, 28ish percent approximately. Mark Wilde : Okay that's helpful. The last question I had, any updated thoughts on Courtland and whether there is any potential to repurpose any portion of that mill, maybe similar to what you did at Franklin a few years ago? Mark Sutton : Mark, you know as we always do look exhaustedly at different opportunities for that asset and there's nothing major that has come out of that work there or maybe a couple of small opportunities that are still alive. But I don't see anything right now in the scale of Franklin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : Mark, first on the EBITDA guidance improvement of 5%, I think you had mentioned that it doesn't reflect much of [indiscernible] improvement. Would you be able to clarify for us, you know what you are factoring in for your volumes in the North American Industrial business within your guidance for 15? Mark Sutton : I think what we've been looking at in terms of our plan and the backdrop against what I was talking about our earnings growth is about a 1% North American Box market growth rate. Alex Ovshey : Got it, and then on the cost side, you know a lot of talk about the inflationary pressure in freight. Can you just size the total cost for the company for securing rail and truck? And you know what is the inflationary percentage that you are sort of seeing on that cost base in 15 versus 14? Tom Kadien : You know we looked across our transportation spend really from rate increases, we're looking at about a $40 million year-over-year cost increase. And then we obviously go and look to -- that's about somewhere in the 3-5%, whether you are talking rail or truck. And we are looking at ways to you know optimize supply chain systems to chip away at that. So we usually typically don't experience the full impact of the rate increases we're able to compensate. But $40 million is probably the number that we would, that we plan for this year. Alex Ovshey : And just last one for me on Ilim. Can you say how much free cash flow the business generated in 14 and what the uses were? I know you guys picked up a $56 million dividend which is great to see. But I just wanted to know what the total free cash flow generation was. And then maybe in terms of 15, if we do you know put up $600 million EBITDA in that business, how much free cash flow does that equate to and how much of that could come back to the company? Carol Roberts : So let me give you a couple of numbers and I am going to let Jay kind of look for it. And so this is more of a pro forma than it is an actual number right now. But if you think about a business that's got $600 million of EBITDA, think about sustained CapEx is around $200 million. Okay and then you\u2019ve got taxes and I think taxes in Russia is, the tax rate is 20ish percent. And then you\u2019ve got to service your debt and so that's the question of how that will come over time and how much leverage do we want to keep on the business. So you can see that it\u2019s going to be a very nice cash flow generator if you kind of do that math. And the interest that we had in 14 was like $70 million, so a lot of nice cash. And then the question is what do you want to do with that cash, dividends to the shareowners or further reinvestment in the business are the options. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam Josephson : A couple of questions on the containerboard export situation, Mark or Carol. One, you know exports are obviously up substantially in the December quarter despite the strengthening dollar and weakness in economies elsewhere. Do you have any thoughts as to why that happened and can you shed any light on how much of that export surge was attributable to your sending board to European box plants? Mark Sutton : You know Adam, I think the real driver of why the exports are up is most of what\u2019s exported is Kraft Liner. And that's what we export and we saw actually improved demand for our Kraft Liner segment. So while at the macro level some of the markets were soft in some of the Kraft Liner segments tends to be in some of the fresh food and humidity-proof kind of segments. We saw improvement, and so we had more customer demand and a good percentage of that goes to our own box business in Europe. Adam Josephson : Okay and just get along similar lines, Mark. You know the trade press talked about the gap between domestic prices and export prices to Europe being unusually wide at the moment, about a $170 a ton. I mean do you think that gap is sustainable, or would you expect a convergence over time between the two for whatever reason? Mark Sutton : Well I think the gap between you know kind of a dollar pricing between domestic containerboard and export containerboard does have a normal control range based on -- a lot of it\u2019s based on FX effects and how containerboard is sold in different parts of the world. So in Latin America for example it\u2019s sold in dollars, no big change in Europe. Some of it\u2019s sold in euros but I think our view is, you know we\u2019ve been doing this for a long, long time before the euro even came into existence. We\u2019ve sold containerboards successfully at $0.84 and we\u2019ve sold it successfully at $1.45. And we're in it for the long-term, so I think that gap will move around. But it seems like it\u2019s in the normal band that you would see when currency moves around. And the bottom line is the customers that we have need Kraft Liner and we're going to supply it to them for those needs. And we will make more money in some periods of time, we\u2019ll make less money in other periods of time, but it\u2019s a strategic segment for us. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon : Yeah first question, I was just having trouble with my phone, is really more for Carol. And it\u2019s interesting, I noticed the tax rate going up from 26 to 31 to 33% and I would suppose that increase has a lot to do with the mix of earnings, especially with the weaker currencies overseas. Is there anything going on that would make us think that that tax rate would continue to move up in future years, or do you think this is a fair place to be, or in fact could it be lower in future years you know if let\u2019s say Brazil comes back? Carol Roberts : Yeah, I think the 26 was unusually low because we had the double year of two helpings of extenders and legislations. The 31 was more normal as you would expect. And then the 33 goes up, because as you stated you know we're going to have more US earnings. And with more US earnings the marginal rate on that is higher and so it\u2019s just going to change the ratio. Well I think for us, 33 is probably a good number to plan again. And then of course we will you know work well within the bounds to you know manage our ETR and our taxes and do the things we can best to pay what we need to pay. Chip Dillon : Got you, and then a quick one on Ilim. I think before we were using $1.5 billion of net debt and now you are saying 1.3 and I might be wrong on that. Did you actually pay off some of the debt that had been accrued there during the project? Carol Roberts : No, that's around the dollars that we\u2019ve got flowing in because of these great operations and margins we\u2019ve got. So we\u2019ve got dollars that are sitting in the bank. Chip Dillon : I got you, okay. And then on the leverage, I noticed that with the pension and the adjustment for the operating leases, it\u2019s you know 3.3 times, which is a bit above your long run I guess target with the ratings agencies. Do you think that's going to necessarily cause you to slow down your share repurchases in 2015, you know all things being equal or not? Carol Roberts : You know, I don\u2019t think so. I think to say once again, we\u2019ve got a great reputation with the rating agencies. You know we\u2019ve got really incredibly low discount rates, so rates go up. You know we\u2019ll make that liability to mark it again at the end of 15, so we\u2019ll be talking to the agencies about our situation. But I don\u2019t think that it will cause a significant shift in our strategy or our capita allocation at this point. Chip Dillon : And then one last quick one. You know I think there was -- and I don\u2019t know who interviewed -- if this was accurate. But I saw a quote somewhere this morning that, it seemed like Mark you had suggested that growing in the containerboard internationally is something that that is important to IP or certainly a potential avenue of growth. And I don\u2019t know, if you could just talk a little bit about how you view the paperboard segment broadly defined in the US and containerboard not outside the US in terms of how those could be opportunities for IP to grow through acquisition? Mark Sutton : Sure, Chip. I think what you saw was, I think an interview and we were talking about opportunities to grow our packaging business. And the question was about North America and I said in North America, our primary opportunities are in our box business given where our position is in containerboard. And then I used an example of Orsa as a containerboard and box move in a market where we can do that. And obviously, as we said we're interested in generating shareholder return by doing what we do well and that may include growing our packaging business globally.  So that was the context of what I think you're referring to. And I think you know consumer packaging is definitely interesting for us, which I think is what you are talking about when you said paperboard. And industrial packaging of course is our driver for the company right now and those are businesses we believe, we have more opportunity and we will continue to evaluate those opportunities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo. Chris Manuel : I wanted to ask a question and I am going to try to be careful how I ask this. But you know if we look at and kind of dissect what you\u2019ve laid out here thus far in the call, is I look at you know where you\u2019ve outlined significant amounts of inflation or headwinds, both you know what you had in 14 and what's looking forward to 15. I think of areas you mentioned like wood inflation, wages, regulatory costs with [boiler mac], healthcare, utilities, transportation, etcetera. It strikes me that it\u2019s been almost two years since we\u2019ve had any sort of recovery for inflation or any components. As you know sit today, how do you feel about the potential environment? We\u2019ve demand that's seemingly much better with opportunity to potentially you know recover some of these higher costs that you're seeing and have to work through the system? Mark Sutton : Chris, that was very carefully asked. But you know obviously we never speculate on what we might do on pricing to recover our cost. It\u2019s obviously a fundamental in business that you need to think about those things. And, we're talking about what we might do in the future, what we\u2019ve always talked about is the conditions that would need to be present for and that's much more complicated than just demand. Chris Manuel : Okay fair enough. Let me flip gears for a second to the coated paperboard business. It looks like you took almost as much downtime in 4Q as you\u2019ve over the last couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about you know where you are set up today there? Do you feel that you\u2019ve kind of got your -- you know are you for inventory levels or are you comfortable that you got what you need done there and you can operate more maybe in line with demand on a go-forward basis? Mike Amick : Hey Chris, this is Mike Amick, a good question. Yeah, we took some [LLO] in Q4. But you know, we typically see a seasonal downturn in Q4, and obviously we're working to match our supply to our customer demand. You know overall we feel good about our inventory levels. You can see what's happened with the industry inventory levels as well from the publication. So we feel pretty good about that. We\u2019ve seen as we expect to see in the first quarter, a little bit of a pickup you know in demand over the course of the last couple of weeks. And so, we\u2019ll continue to you know again to manage our supply to our demand, but you know we feel pretty good right now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : I know it\u2019s hard to call a bottom on a currency or a stock for that matter, but does it make sense to maybe hedge the ruble impact at some stage on the joint venture debt or is the natural hedge with your operation sufficient? Carol Roberts : It\u2019s the natural hedge, Steve and you know the way we say it is we borrow dollars and they are still the same dollars. So there is the non-cash and so when you start hedging non-cash accounting things, you are incurring a cost without necessarily an economic benefit [indiscernible]. Steve Chercover : That's fine. I suppose your JV partners have never been happier to get US dollar dividends? Carol Roberts : Yeah. Steve Chercover : And then similarly I see that you know China, this has been touched on, but that's not listed as you know something that's going to be getting better in 2015, or at least not on page twenty four. I mean how long are you going to tolerate that, is it much of a distraction to management? Mark Sutton : That's a good question, Steve. You know we\u2019ve got a good team in China. They manage the business. It\u2019s not a distraction to management at all. And again, you know we wouldn\u2019t speculate on what we would do in all of our businesses. We evaluate them for the near-term, midterm and long-term, and we look at China beyond what we just have in China. We view China as an important market for IP. Carol talked about you know a big portion of the rationale for Ilim is all about China. We import products from the US to China, that they need like fluff pulp and containerboard, and we\u2019ve operations in China.  So when we think about China, we think about from the IP side, we think about all of those activities. And it\u2019s an important market and we\u2019ve tried to address it in different ways. So I think we will continue to look at that and all of those kinds of ways to serve that market and continue to evaluate it as we go forward. Steve Chercover : Thank you and then one other perhaps oddball question. We're well aware that Styrofoam cups are being phased out and it appears that you know all kinds of Styrofoam products are actually you know on the wane. So I'm wondering beyond Bleached Board, are there other substrates where you can win, you know perhaps even molded pulp for take-out containers? Mark Sutton : Well I think that's to my earlier answer to a similar question that, you know extending our products and know-how into new uses is something we look at constantly and to see if we can create value. And then going into adjacent spaces, where maybe we look at combining materials like fiber and something else to make a better product. Again most of those markets have valid competitors who are really good at what they do. So if we think about doing it we think about it because we believe we can have a competitive advantage and that maybe complementary offerings with what we already do would be a better solution for the customer. So yes it\u2019s on the table, almost on a continuous basis. It\u2019s part of our business planning and strategic inputs to our strategic plan that we do from our marketing teams. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Mark, just looking at the EBITDA guidance for 2015, you are talking about 5% growth off of the $4.1 billion in 2014. And sort of just compound that in getting to you know $5 billion EBITDA for the company. You know you are talking about 4 to 5 years until you actually reach, if you maintain growth at that 5% rate, so you can get to 5 billion. Is there something in the next few years where you see the potential for acceleration in EBITDA growth within any other businesses that could shorten that timeframe? Mark Sutton : Well, that's obviously what we work on every day and we're not satisfied with our path toward our 5 billion. And we talked about this before and one of the biggest misses is we had a slightly better economic environment during that period. And we called it a mid-cycle target, mid-cycle demand, mid-cycle cost and we probably haven\u2019t seen the demand side really. So a small amount of demand improvement really ratchets that performance up pretty quickly. And then you know we've got more opportunities and some internal improvements that we can pull forward. But we really probably need a little bit better economic set of conditions to accelerate it in a meaningful way lacking, you know changing the company in some way. But with what we\u2019ve today is what we said we're focused on getting the 5 billion with the IP we\u2019ve today. Scott Gaffner : Sure and a couple of questions on the corrugated business, specifically I mean you talked about for the FX impact on exports. It sounds like minimal impact to your export business or within the normal range. But when you look back historically FX and the impact potentially on imports, is there a dollar strength level where you actually start to see imports incentivized into the US potentially disrupting you know some of the supply-demand balance that we\u2019ve today? Mark Sutton : Imports of containerboard have a lot more issues to manage than just the economic piece. So the US market, given the way it's constructed, who makes the boxes and those types of things makes importing containerboard a bit of a challenge. So I don't know if there's a number, I guess there\u2019s always a number. But I don't think we see imports of containerboard in the US being a major, a major issue. Scott Gaffner : Okay and then just lastly around e-commerce and the impact on the box business in North America. Any sort of additional work you've done to sort of measure the impact of e-commerce, how that might have impacted the fourth quarter, where it is as a percentage of sales etcetera? Mark Sutton : Well I think as a market that segment is still pretty small as a segment of the US Box market. I think it\u2019s 2 to 3% or something in that range, but it\u2019s growing at an impressive rate. You know our business in that segment has been one of our high points and you know in the 15 to 20% growth range. And I think that's how much the segment is growing as well in addition to our numbers. But I believe that's going to continue, but again there\u2019s so many boxes in the US used for other things. And it'll be a while before it\u2019s maybe a major segment, but the growth rate is exciting. And corrugated gets to show its full value to the market in that kind of supply chain, and so we're excited to be participating in that segment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn, RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Two easy questions. One, whether you could comment on last week, there was a filing by four of your paper competitors on looking for antidumping duties, if you could comment on that? And just you referenced the fluff pulp mix improvement, just if you could give a couple of comments on your outlook for fluff as well as NBSK from Ilim going forward? Mark Sutton : Okay Paul, I\u2019ll take the question on the antidumping case, and then I\u2019ll ask Mike Amick to update you on our pulp business. He has the pulp business in our paper sector. On the antidumping case, you know obviously we're aware of it. Our set of kind of conditions are different than a lot of the other players. We\u2019ve a global footprint in uncoated free sheet and you know we rely on the flexibility of that network. So our view on that is probably a little different than some of the other companies that are named in the complaint. But largely we make the printing papers around the world that we make for the local markets or the regional markets and import virtually nothing to the US. So that's not made in the US from our own operations. Mike Amick : Hey Paul, this is Mike Amick. On your second question on fluff pulp, obviously you saw from the slide that you know the pulp business had a nice year-over-year improvement. And we feel pretty good about the pulp business, the mix has been a large part of that lever as we\u2019ve taken you know our mix up to, close to three quarters of our pulp. And we will continue to you know to drive that improvement lever and feel you know pretty good about 2015. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : If I could go back to your Brazil business, you know you are pointing to stable pricing and cost in Q1. I was just curious if there is a concern you know however that electricity prices could impact your paper and packaging business down there in the region for 2015? Mark Sutton : Yes definitely, Debbie it\u2019s definitely something we're watching. The electricity prices are very dependant on rainfall and water reservoir levels and we dealt with those issues throughout 2014. It\u2019s not completely behind us by any stretch of the imagination, so you know it\u2019s a potential. We don\u2019t plan for everything that could go wrong going wrong, but we are watching it, and putting contingency plans in for that exact potential. Debbie Jones : Okay and then there has been a discussion on the call about you know further expansion into you know packaging outside the US and I am just wondering if Brazil, you did mention this before. If there are any opportunities down there for you that you would see that might be attractive? Mark Sutton : You know we like what we\u2019ve started in Brazil. It\u2019s not performing to our expectations, but we think we know how to fix it. And I think if we can show that we can do that, we would like to look at opportunities. Brazil is an interesting packaging market. There is opportunities to do organic moves and there is opportunities to potentially make small acquisitions. There are no large, large players or anything like that. So you\u2019ve to build the business in a different way, but it is something we\u2019ve interest in and you know we\u2019ll only do it if we think we can create value doing it. Operator : Your last question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Just a couple of quick questions on domestic box markets. You know we saw some consolidation by independent coordinators last year and early this year and some capacity coming online. I guess my first question is, are you seeing increased competitive pressure in any of the regional box markets where you compete? And then a related question, you know given price declines in OCC, you know are customers coming to you in any meaningful way and saying that they want you know more test liner and less kraft liner or are you seeing any kind of mix shift there? Mark Sutton : Anthony, I think on the first part of your question. You know we\u2019ve seen kind of a normal level of competitive activity regionally as you mentioned based on some new capacity being absorbed. I don\u2019t think anything has really changed in the third quarter or fourth quarter. We just kind of navigated through that process. It\u2019s obviously pushed some product probably to the export markets from the US, but we see that is kind of stable and no real change as the year went on. And again a little bit of growth probably helped in the fourth quarter and would definitely help get that capacity to market in the 2015 period.  And there's no discussions about you know normal input costs like OCC that would drive our customers to test liner. Our customers really talk to us about you know working collaboratively on what the best solution is. And sometimes I wouldn\u2019t call it test liner in the US as much as I would call it a recycled blend of paper. But the performance specs are really what matter, and that's what the customers are interested in. Anthony Pettinari : Okay that's very helpful and then may be just one follow-up. I mean OCC prices have been weak for maybe a little bit longer than some of us had expected. And as you think about your 2015 you know kind of internal projections, do you expect OCC to stay at these levels for the year or do you expect some kind of recovery in OCC? Mark Sutton : Well Anthony, that is obviously an important question. Every time we try to answer it, we're like everyone else, we're wrong. So we really don't know, we will monitor it. I think Carol mentioned earlier OCC is going to be a function of global economic conditions based on where the primary OCC containerboard is made. So Asia getting better would probably firm up OCC and other markets like that. So I think you know we're going to watch it and be prepared for you know whatever happens. But we really have no way of knowing generation is part of the impact. Collection rates have improved throughout the world, so we will probably be looking at -- and I must say this. And I\u2019ll be wrong, a stable OCC in 2015. Operator : And I will now turn the call back to Jay. Jay Royalty : Yeah so we took a few extra questions this morning, so we'll go ahead and wrap it up. Well thank everybody for joining us and being on the call and as always Michele and I are available after the presentation. Our phone numbers on page twenty six, so have a great day. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Davidson Anthony Pettinari - Citi Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on slide 2 of the presentation. We will also present certain non-U. S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for your interest in International Paper and for taking time to join our quarterly call. I'm going to start on slide 5. International Paper delivered a solid performance in the first quarter. Our team successfully managed the business to improve margins and improve earnings. This is enabling International Paper to continue to deliver strong results. Extreme weather had some impact on our results in North America. Although, our operations overall performed well. We saw particularly strong results out of the Ilim joint venture in Russia. As margins expanded due to our strong export position. Our research in EBITDA margin, absolute EBITDA and free cash flow, all improved year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased with how we operated and with our results in the first quarter. We feel like we're off to a good start to 2015. Continuing with our financial results on slide 6. EPS was $0.84 a share for the first quarter. And, this includes $0.04 of unfavorable Ilim FX impact. Our EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. EBITDA grew by $32 million year-over-year. And, free cash flow improved to $319 million, up from $252 million in the first quarter of 2014. If we dive a little deeper into margins, you can see on slide 7 that we're successfully managing our margins across our key businesses. Global dynamics are different in each of these regions and across the businesses. But, our teams are finding ways to drive improved performance in the face of these challenges. Despite the economic backdrop, we're finding ways to continue to win and improve results. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Carol to cover the details in the quarter and the second-quarter outlook. Carol Roberts : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the sequential bridge to the $0.84. Prices in mix were slightly unfavorable and volume was lower due to seasonality in Brazil and lower volume in industrial packaging. As Mark mentioned, operations were solid even with some winter weather impact in North America. Input costs were favorable, particularly for energy and diesel. However, I would note that the diesel benefit was largely offset by higher distribution rates. And, we saw the favorable - large favorable swing for Ilim. With most of this coming from a less severe ruble devaluation against the U.S. dollar, compared to what occurred in the prior quarter. And, as Mark mentioned, on an absolute basis, the $0.84 for the first quarter does include a $0.04 unfavorable Ilim FX charge. Moving to slide 9. In industrial packaging, beginning with price. Most of the impact we experienced in the quarter was on lower export prices. Which, were largely a function of currency and the impacts of the strong U.S. dollar? Volume was lower. As shipments were impacted by weather, along with lower demand from several of our largest customers. Year-over-year, our shipments were up 1% on a same-day basis. And finally, operations and input costs were favorable sequentially. Partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense in the quarter, as expected. And, as you saw on the margin slide that was previously shown by Mark. Overall, another strong quarter for our industrial packaging business. Moving to consumer packaging on slide 10. Mix improved slightly and volume was favorable in North America. Input costs in North America were a tailwind as well. Partially offset by higher distribution rates. The first quarter is typically a higher-cost operating quarter in North America, due to seasonality. And, this was only made worse by the periods of extreme winter weather. And, if you think about that, it's just about how cold it was and some of the energy implications that it takes to run some of these big integrated mills. Additionally, the business incurred some additional cost with the difficult startup at Augusta, following the annual outage there. But in total, a much stronger start to the year for consumer packaging in 2015. In printing papers, we experienced some softness in North American pulp and paper pricing, along with a less favorable mix in Brazil. Which, was due to seasonally lower domestic demand? The Brazil seasonality accounted for the majority of the lower volume as well. Which, was further amplified by the weak market conditions in the region? Operations and other costs were negatively impacted by negative weather. Along with a one-time charge for the write-off of a project which we chose to abandon. Lower input costs for diesel and energy were offset by some commercial pressure and higher distribution rates. And finally, there was some modest unfavorable FX impacts for the quarter. As FX headwinds in Europe were greater than the net tailwinds we experienced in Brazil. Turning to Ilim on slide 12. The JV turned in its second consecutive quarter of very strong performance on the back of expanding margins. Driven by its strong export position. And now, is the lowest-cost softwood pulp producer on the globe. Operational EBITDA for the quarter was $186 million, up 62% from Q1 2014. The JV did experience a modest negative non-cash FX related accounting charge of $47 million. Associated with the U.S. dollar denominated net debt, which was $1.2 billion for the first quarter. The JV remains focused on cost management and post-project optimization. To stay ahead of rising inflation and to offset the tough economic conditions in the country. Ilim expects lower earnings in the second quarter before considering any FX impact from the accounting treatment on the debt. Due to a $10 million maintenance outage that's scheduled at the big brocks mills and higher inflation. So, moving to the outlook for the second quarter. Volume will be up for our North American packaging business. With one more day and seasonal strengthenity. Particularly, in industrial packaging with the onset of the ag season. The industrial packaging volume is expected to increase by approximately 4% quarter over quarter. Consumer volume will increase as well. Due to the strengthening backlog. Volume in Brazil papers will increase as we move past the seasonal weakness of the first quarter. Pricing is expected to be largely flat across the businesses. With the exception of Brazil, where paper prices are increasing in local currency. And, mix is expected to improve in North American paper and pulp. Good operational performance across most of the businesses is expected to continue. With some improvement in North American paper, North American industrial packaging, and North American consumer packaging. Due to less weather impact and seasonally stronger demand. In Brazil, we're beginning to see some signs of fiscal policy tightening. As the government begins to do things to egress the growing budget deficit. And, we're seeing line of sight that this may, and will probably, include lower export incentives, higher taxes, and potentially, tariffs on energy usage. Input costs are expected to remain stable as most of the benefit is already in the first quarter results. Distribution rates and wood costs are expected to remain, what we would consider as, relatively high. The second quarter is the heaviest maintenance outage quarter for the year. And, is increasing $65 million sequentially over first quarter. And as we've talked about, Ilim's expected to continue to perform well. And, for the purposes of this outlook, we've assumed flat FX from where we exited the quarter. So, a non-repeat of that modest negative. But, the JV does expect this to be offset by the items that I mentioned regarding the brocks outage and higher inflation. And so, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Carol. So, now I'd like to shift gears a little bit as we close out the comments and go to Q& A. Take a few minutes to talk about value creation and what we're doing in International Paper. I'm on slide 14. This slide shows IP's ten-year journey to improve our return on invested capital results. With the last five years being in excess of our goal to consistently deliver results above our cost of capital. Now, obviously we want to improve that spread above our cost of capital. But, we're demonstrating that we can be at, or exceed, our cost of capital which is a key measure for our value creation mindset at International Paper. It's the yardstick; ROIC is. That we measure investments by and make decisions in terms of what strategy we should deploy. Our primary intent is to increase the value of IP over time and we've been successfully doing that. And, we're excited about the path we're on. This next slide highlights the main elements of IP's value creation and capital allocation strategy. As we've indicated, we're running our businesses consistently well and are generating strong free cash flow year in and year out. Averaging $1.8 billion annually over the last several years. This has enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet, provide adequate CapEx to sustain this strong level of performance, reinvest in our core businesses, and return significant cash to shareholders. We intend to continue this balanced use of cash approach to keep the company on sound financial footing, to reward our shareholders, and to increase the value of International Paper. Our dividend policy and actions are clear. And, there are - there's more room to grow. We've been opportunistic with our share buyback program. Taking advantage of dips to buy shares at an average price below our intrinsic value. And, this has become an important tool and a good way to supplement return of cash to shareholders. I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter, we completed the initial $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. As of today's call, we have bought back roughly $120 million of shares since the first of the year on the new authorization. Additionally, we continue to look for good ideas in which to invest. Whether they're to strengthen and improve results within our existing businesses. Or, selective M&A opportunities that are the right fit for IP and can be accretive to ROIC and our results. I'd like now to turn your focus to a couple of great examples that we've recently announced and are acting on. The first, on slide 16, is an update on our strategic reinvestment at the Valliant Mill. As you're aware, we made the decision to restart the number three container board machine at Valliant last year. And, our team has been actively working toward that objective for the last several months. We're excited to report that the machine is up and running now, ahead of schedule and making salable product at this time. This machine fills a large whole in our medium capacity with the roll off of the purchase obligations that were created with the mills that we divested as part of the Temple-Inland acquisition. Valliant is well-positioned to serve our needs to the South, where we have a large presence in the box market, as well as the West Coast markets. This additional capacity also enables us to cost-effectively handle the expected growth in specialty, craft liner board exports and our North American box markets. It also gives us additional flexibility to meet the needs and maintain our low-cost position. While we continue to balance our system supply with our overall customer demand. And, it goes back to what we've talked about before. And that being, our multi-channel strategy the we deploy in our industrial packaging business. It's a very attractive deployment of capital; an existing facility with expected returns in excess of 25%. We expect this project to ramp up over the balance of 2015. And, it's a great addition to an already very good container board mill system. Next project I'd like to talk about is the con - is the project to convert our Riegelwood, North Carolina mill to a 100% pulp. To meet the growing needs of our fluff pulp customers of the next several years. This project involves the removal of 350,000 tons of coated paperboard capacity at the Riegelwood Mill. Much of which is dedicated to the production of coated bristles for the printing markets, under our Carolina brand. We're selling the Carolina brand to MeadWestvaco and repositioning the coated paperboard business to focus more on the packaging grades of coated board. And, to free up the capacity to make the fluff pulp and softwood pulp at the Riegelwood Mill. The conversion will provide additional pulp capacity of 400,000 tons at Riegelwood, and will bring our North American pulp system to 1.7 million tons. Importantly, 1.4 million of that is capable of making high-quality fluff pulp. This is the latest in a series of conversions to expand our fluff pulp business. By the way, a business we've been in since 1984 out of our Georgetown Mill. The coated paperboard capacity that we make in the coated bristles area will be shut down by early 2016. And, the new pulp capacity will be online by mid-2016. Riegelwood will have the capacity, or the capability, excuse me, to flex this capacity as our market needs demand. Between market softwood pulp and fluff pulp. This - the decision to convert the mill was based on the opportunity to grow with the market and our customers in the attractive fluff pulp market. We have the best customers in the market and the best growing markets geographically throughout the world. It also allows us to streamline our coated paperboard system. We intend to support our coated paperboard customers. And, the attractive growth segments, as I mentioned, in food service and consumer packaging grades out of our top rated mills in Texarkana, Texas and Augusta, Georgia. This investment of $135 million at Riegelwood has an expected return of greater than 20%. So in closing, International Paper continues to perform well today. We like the positions we've built in the key markets where we've chosen to operate. And, the businesses - in the businesses that are needle movers for IP. These strong positions, along with great execution by our teams on the ground, are enabling IP to manage margins and increase profitability. Regardless of what the market throws at us. We realize the world is a dynamic place and we're mindful of global demand, trade flows, and the implications of a strong U.S. dollar. But, given our strong positions and our great customer base, we feel it's all manageable. We have a solid pipeline of high return capital opportunities, a couple of which I've just highlighted, that'll enable us to successfully deploy capital and increase value. Our strong free cash flow generation enables us to fund these attractive opportunities. While continuing to return an attractive level of cash to our shareholders. All in, we remain excited about where we are, the path we're on, and what's out in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay and open it up for questions. Jay Royalty : Operator, we're ready to take questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : My first question has to do with well I have a couple of questions. One is the timing of the regal would conversion obviously the fluff pulp market is very attractive given its growth in international markets with rising living standards. And I know is close to the port of Wellington and news and export product. But the timing seems interesting to us because of the fact that other capacity is coming on. There is another player that might need to participate temporarily as a deal with the conversion. Themselves. So we were curious about that and wondered why now. And the second question has to do with could you remind us of your container board mill and box integration level in Europe proper? I guess excluding Russia? Mark Sutton : Chip I will ask Mike who runs our consumer packaging business and North American papers to take the first one and Tim Nicholls will do the second question. Mike Amick : As far as the timing of the regal would conversion without really referencing what others may or may not doing we are just reacting to the need that we have within our system to meet the strategic business and the demands that we see growing across the world. So this decision is very timely for us. And were excited about the opportunity and the value this will create for our customers and for share owners going forward. Chip Dillon : And then on the integration levels in Europe? Tim Nicholls : They're pretty small because most of the business over there is focused on industrial and test liner. We do have a big fresh fruit and vegetable segment and we do sell board out of North America and we are the main supplier for craft Virgin, but on a total bases and this is a little bit of a round number, but I would say we are probably close to 15 to [indiscernible] percent of their total by. But a big portion of the Virgin craft piece. Chip Dillon : Just real quickly to follow back on the fluff conversion. Could you just remind us how much or how different it is selling fluff pulp to a typical consumer products company versus selling paper grade even into tissue and certainly into regular paper. To find at least important to have some staying power to the market . To the contracts tend to be a little bit longer and the standards, do people specify certain Mills etc.? Mike Amick : It is a technical cell. It is a product that requires a fair amount of engineering and qualification process is quite lengthy. So it is a sale. As I said it's a qualification process. And there are typically contracts as well. But that varies depending upon the customer and the situation. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Two quick ones. First of all as you noted there have been lots of shifting dynamics. I believe at the end of the last quarter you had laid out a goal were expectation of about a 5% improvement in EBITDA for this year is that something you think is still doable? Mark Sutton : We do. If the year is one quarter down and three corners to go. It's a steep challenge as we laid out. But we do believe we need to shoot for 5% EBITDA growth. We have some plans that put us within striking distance of that and we are hopeful and we've got a lot of time left in the year to do that. We've probably got about a 4% year-over-year in the first quarter but the challenges steeper. But that something we still have our eyes on. Mark Weintraub : And then second if I look at I think at slide 22 you show market downtime for your different businesses. And container board for the first time since second quarter 2015 perhaps, you didn't take any market downtime. Yet at the same time you can see that the volumes in your industrial business both versus the first quarter and versus the year ago though very slightly versus the year ago there was a bit of a negative hit. So there seems to be almost a little bit of a surprise that for the first time in a while where you're actually seeing a little bit of the negative hit on the volume side where you're not taking any market downtime in container board. Can you maybe talk us through a little bit through the thought process there? Mark Sutton : As you can imagine there's a number of things going on Mark. First of all were buying less board on the outside because we have less requirement to do so. We are needing to take board for all of our channels to market. Second of all were getting ready for what is going to be our largest outage quarter of the whole year. It's a big step up first quarter was big it's a big step or up the first quarter. And then lastly we ran better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth. But we still didn't run particularly well so we were scrambling a bit to try to get the building product in our pipeline are going to need as we go through the area. Mark Weintraub : So at the end of the day would you say your inventory situation is just where you want to be in container board? Mark Sutton : Not quite, we built 60,000 inventory we would've liked a probably a little bit more. If you think about it in terms of our system that\u2019s less than two days of production and we\u2019re going through a very heavy season. So it's close to what we wanted but probably a little bit on the light side. Operator : Your next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : I'm wondering dive back into consumer and by box board markets and I missed this, I remember we were having two machines could you relay or rewrite how much you're taking out of the Bristol market and then the related question how do you see the folding box board markets in now in terms of in terms of supply demand balance specifically in North America? Mike Amick : Your first question was around the printing piece of that. That business represents about 15% of our total capacity. So roughly in the neighborhood of call it 250,000 tons of capacity is what's being made at our Riegelwood facility directed at printing papers market. Mark Sutton : From a supply demand balance I guess you're asking really on a worldwide basis. You're still seeing we are still seeing a large supply position out there relative to demand. And that's something that we understand and we look at and manage but that still the case. George Staphos : Maybe backing up and segueing off of your earlier questions how much of the conversion here was driven by the opportunities you see in fluff pulp and how much was a recognition of a potential supply demand imbalance in the future in the box board markets? I know it's hard to be precision like in your comment here but were interested in your thoughts. Mark Sutton : This is one of these situations that come up maybe not too often where you've got a win-win. This was primarily a move driven by our fluff position. And trying to improve our position in that business. For the long-term. George Staphos : Okay. I guess to last ones in alternate over. Bigger picture you've done a great job of improving as you've pointed out this part of your cost of capital market or the last couple of years. And you intend to continue that. How do you see the strategy shifting at IP if at all to manage and grow that spread. Do you see that being driven by things you do within your capital structure? To improve the spread? Or do you see it being driven more by investment and within investment you see it being more by acquisition opportunities or more the sorts of things like Valliant and Riegelwood? Thanks and I will turn it over. Mark Sutton : I think for a company that has a scale that we haven't to be able to move the needle you have to keep all of your strategic options available to you. So it's probably will be a little bit of all of the above that you just talked about. For I think you will see is more opportunities with projects like Valliant the build upon a strong position business or region and to improve that position. And that something that we have not really done a lot of lately because we were doing some large M&A work and sort of build the company we have today. So I think some of this goes in cycles but back to my comments on ROIC the measure to look at where you know work to create value against that backdrop looking to maintain a solid spread above our cost of capital, and what we do will need to pass that test. Operator : Your next question is from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman : Carol or Mark expand the project abandonment can you quantify how much the charge was and will that be the option for the paper machine down at [indiscernible]? Carol Roberts : Gail, I would prefer not to call out exactly what it is because it would give some insight into some of the stuff but it was pretty much in accounting thing. We go ahead and approve code I funds for capital and once we make a decision let's they were not going to permit pursue something let's keep her book straight. It was enough that I felt that we needed to call it out but that's about the detail I'll be guilty give you. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what's been going on the uncoated free she market are you seeing any response in the market to the threat of duties and any view on what might happen in June? Mike Amick : As you're seeing as you're seeing reported in the industry numbers, there has been some pullback in reduction in imports coming into the U.S.. As far as going from a kind of a timeline standpoint the IPC rules is now on the hands of the Department of Commerce. And we'll see expect to see an answer or ruling from them on duties or potential duties sometime in June. Gail Glazerman : And that have you heard from customers that you might've lost last year reports coming in? Are you seeing that or is it just with the demand supply and that's kind of offsetting it? Mark Sutton : We haven't seen that Gail. Gail Glazerman : Can you give a little bit of color what you're seeing in currently in terms of the box market if you look into the second quarter and maybe a little bit of color on as well? Mark Sutton : We\u2019re seeing a seasonal pickup in April. The first court economic activity was lighter than we would have hoped coming into the quarter. We had a little bit of a soft margin things kind of settled out but I think that we are seeing kind of a normal seasonal pickup and second quarter is a big order for us. It's a lot of fresh fruit and vegetable and so I'd say April so far is seasonally up. Gail Glazerman : And export demand? Mark Sutton : Export demand has been pretty good. You read all the headlines from the newspapers and you'd think that it would take a hit, but we've seen the FX in Europe from a demand standpoint it's been really consistent. Operator : Next question is from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : Looking at the first quarter box shipment number for IP versus the industry can you just talk about the drivers of the underperformance. Why IP's number came in later and looking forward is the expectation for the balance of the year that the volume number could potential he lag the industry? Mark Sutton : What we constantly do is make choices around customers. And some of what hit us in the first quarter was choices around customer mix that we had made in the fourth quarter and those finally came fully through. In the first quarter. Yes over the next quarter or two we could be caught depending on what the market does, down a little bit or close. But what we\u2019re trying to do is manage the portfolio across all the segments that we serve to make sure we're picking the right pieces of the business to make right sense for us for long-term. So it's kind of a constant evaluation that we go through and we were a little bit light in the quarter. But I don't think that is be concerned. Alex Ovshey : And then thinking about your European container board business box business you supply a lot of your craft lighter board from the U.S. but you mentioned that the test liner is purchased locally. Is there a strategic benefit from potentially integrating that converting business in Europe with mill assets? Can you talk us through that scenario? Mark Sutton : We evaluate the test liner integration benefits and level on a continuous basis. There was a time where we were 35% integrated we had a mill in France that we closed. We have good integration level in our business in Morocco, we have a couple of mills in Turkey, we really look at it on in available paper type of segments we choose to participate in. Our business as I've mentioned before is largely built around the Mediterranean region and fresh food areas that a heavy craft liner and semi can media market. That's the primary focus of that market. And we view the craft liner as an extension in between our North American box system. So as we think about strategic development of the business the need to make some of our own test liner or more than we do today will continuously be evaluated. But there is ample supply in Europe for companies that are configured like us so the availability of the paper is there. It has to be the right economic and has to be the right quality. With the way to different products were making. There could be a scenario where make sense to make more but right now we feel like our position is in a good spot will be evaluated on a continuous basis and will be in and out overtimes of test liner. Alex Ovshey : If I can just ask one quick one on Ilim I think you talked with a normal EBITDA out of the business of about $600 million. With all the puts and takes do we think run track to be able to achieve that number in 2015? And what would be the cash dividend that would be associated with having an EBITDA number that's close to the $600 million number? Carol Roberts : I think there is a good shot to hit that number a lot will depend on how things turn out. We are performing well we've got graced cost positions a lot of depend on demand out of China for pulp and kind of where the currency goes another stakes. Relative to the dividend it's going to be very cash positive so a lot of that will depend on Ilim board will make that decision will be around that debt covenants and will be for lack of cash. So we feel very good about that business and think we\u2019re going to have a very strong year. Operator : Your next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : This is Alex [indiscernible] on for Phil, thanks for taking my question. So the strong dollars have been at headwind for expert between her board prices but there's also been some container board price increased in Europe and Brazil, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of export prices and your outlook prices begin to firm up? Tim Nicholls : Most of the movement that we've seen as really been currency related out of Europe. We haven't really seen any movement and other regions world. And the price we've announced price increases on Europe shipments is there going out we started earlier this year but that's only made up about half of the impact on currency so I'd say it's Europe on currency and yes there's some pressure, there's been some spot prices here and there but nothing structural that we have seen so far in other parts of the world. Unidentified Analyst : And just one follow. I appreciate the color on April box trend seasonally is any way you can give a comp on apples to apples year-over-year basis? Tim Nicholls : We'll see how the quarter plays on talk to you the end of the second quarter. Like I said it's usually our strongest quarter in terms of volume. And we\u2019re seeing seasonal lift so far. So we feel okay about it. Operator : Your next question is from Al Kabili with Macquarie. Al Kabili : I guess the question for Tim is just on the opportunity for further optimization in the container board business. Can you just update us where we are at their in North America and if there is any specific targeted improvement that you have for this year on that? Tim Nicholls : Well we are constantly looking every year we have a certain amount of initiative baked in and it's across the board. We had extremely good performance in our converting operations in the first quarter both on waste on per foot. In the middle system we are targeting cash costs every year. We did not run as well as we wanted to in the first quarter but we ran a lot better than that in the fourth quarter and we feel good about the rest of the year. So it's going to be running the mills more reliably and running better from a input consumption standpoint. Supply chain continues to be a big opportunity for us. And running the mills reliably helps that because we there's freight logical statements from mills to converting facilities and when were up and down in mill facilities it makes it a little bit harder to keep supply chain in line. I think we've got a pretty good plan for this year in terms of improvement. Across converting mills and. Al Kabili : And just on I know the export had sort of in the majority of the pricing sequentially in the business. But from the medium published medium price cuts do you see any meaningful impact from that? Or maybe can call it what that impact is. I would think there might be a sequential drag as you see the full impact in that into queue although maybe light. Thanks Tim Nicholls : Yes I don't to get going to be a huge shift for us. I just don't see the medium having a big impact on performance systems. Al Kabili : Okay and the final question is just on the West Coast is going through another pretty severe drought this year. I know that impacted you last year. Any early read on what the impact might be this year? Mark Sutton : It's hard to tell what happens to the course of the year a little bit the first quarter. Second quarter is when we naturally pick up around produce fresh fruit and vegetables so we'll have to see. Yet still dry. What has helped is the port situation. Just there were agricultural products that were sitting in ports spoiling. Among other things. And having that resolved in the supply chain starting to correct themselves is going to be a help. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark Connelly : Just one question [indiscernible] used to talk about capital spending versus depreciation levels geographically that he was spending more capital and growth markets overseas and less in the U.S.. As we think about the new spending and the new initiatives that you're making in the U.S. as that changed dramatically. And when you think that balance of To depreciation domestically and overseas is going to be over the next couple of years? Mark Sutton : I think some of the spending that you referenced really was about hoping some position and some new markets. All most by design you're going to spend early on greater depreciation. I think our view is spending is up percentage of Bruce appreciation more portly IBR capital spend it as a percentage of our revenue and where we think we can generate these returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital. Again back to that is a more focused filter work that's where you'll begin to see more capital in the strategic reinvestment category invested where we really believe we can create that sustained value. And it will be looking at capital as a percentage of our revenue and also as a percentage of depreciation and looking at that together. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Mark when I look at the two projects the Valliant restart and then I looked down at the regal conversion the Valliant project just when he 5% IRR is 20% plus the question is really going forward on these capital investments. Is there a belief within the company that we should be looking at lower IRR's on future investments, is at the quick correct way to read that? Mark Sutton : Not sure I understand why you would include that are you thinking maybe we did the highest once first? Correct Scott Gaffner : Correct exactly. Mark Sutton : No that\u2019s not a good conclusion. What drives the timing on projects like this is the return is honestly important but there is an acceptable group of projects Mike described the market demands of our customers. The timing of bringing product into the market. You think about Valliant part of that timing was based on May versus by and the role of our agreements. On the fluff project we have the customer base we want and that customer base so that drove the timing more than it was the highest to returns we had. So I think the kinds of projects you'll be seeing in the future will be in this range and better. Not worse. Scott Gaffner : I appreciate you clearing that up. Just following up on exports. Obviously pricing's been a little bit pressure just because the FX component. But when you look at shipping costs have you noticed a significant offset there from lower shipping cost into the export regions that might benefit? Mark Sutton : I think that for the whole company because we export a lot of things from the U.S.. I don't Nick we've seen a significant offset in the export arena . They are puts and takes but nothing that's shown up materially as an offset to the pressures you described. Operator : Next question is from Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wondered if you could first will update us I think you've been doing some kind of recent around the whole international portfolio with the company it sounded like China had been under the biggest question for you and I wondered if you be willing to talk about that? Mark Sutton : I can't talk about anything in detail. The what you're referring to is we talked about a couple calls and as a couple of conferences and that is we constantly need to reevaluate our positions in our strategy and looking at places that we really believe on the long-term International Paper can win. So the international regions that we are in today are under evaluation and as you can see from decisions we've made even domestically with the coated paperboard repositioning our positions in the U.S. are under evaluation all against the backdrop of can we win long-term and produce returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. Maybe not all at the same time in any moment at time but that's the goal, get the company's return on invested capital to be balanced in any part of the company in the long-term contribute to the target. With that as backdrop we have work to do I'm not prepared to talk about any conclusions, but rest assured that work is being done. Mark Wilde : I wonder just looking at volumes quarter to quarter and year-over-year couple of them really jumped out at me. One was the drop off in the Asian quoted board volumes and the other was the weakness in the Brazilian uncoated paper volumes. I guess particularly with Brazil and other Brazil is weak but I also know that a weaker the business should be much Mark competitive from an expert standpoint. Mark Sutton : I think in the Brazil piece one of the issues with the IP numbers was we had a tremendous first quarter in 2014. Without the lion share some incremental demand the came out of some government programs and we didn't have that this particular quarter. So our comp was particularly difficult. But we are not losing our position in our business in our margins in the paper business in Brazil, we're still very strong. It was really more of a timing and comp issue more than anything else in the Brazil paper demand paper drop off. Now the coated board in China I think part of what we\u2019re doing in our coated board business in China we made those investments to make the high-end of the market. And were continuing to upgrade our mix and in some cases base on the supply demand economics and margin pressures it was the right economic decision for us to make less of those lower and general folding carton grades and more of the higher-end grades that go into more sophisticated packaging. And just make less product to make a better result. So that demand relative to the market is self-inflicted and the right decision for us because our strategy was to make the high-end grades. Mark Wilde : The last thing I wanted to do is just circle back on that three times leverage target that you have had Mark. And I just like some updated thoughts on how important getting down to that level is for you. And what you'd be willing to go up to in the short-term for a transaction? Mark Sutton : I think it is no change in our view on that. I think the three times leverage is the right place for International Paper over time. You've obviously seen us go above that that we did it and we got it back they quickly. So I think the strategy we would have on any kind of investment that would require us to increase our leverage would be along those lines where if we did it, we already have a plan to get it back . And as we announced the transaction the transaction to be announced in the plan of how we get our leverage `we think it's important the long-term health the company and to be a long-term value creator that being in that zone is important. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris Manuel : Just a couple of follow-up from earlier questions. First I looking at fleet slide 32 refer to year-over-year price in your North American container board being down a chunk and I guess I'm presuming a lot of that I'm sorry currency driven. Can you maybe talk about the appetite or how you think about particular given your strategy as a using the European operations is an expert be three North American Mills is how you feel about needing to recover or maintain certain price cost relationships. Additionally you've got some inflation stuff you've mentioned logistics and freight that event up a bit. How do you think about maintaining a recovering some elements for your system? Mark Sutton : First of all we shift through multiple channels and we expect all those channels to earn their keep. So when we see margin pressure were looking for ways to recover that or shift from one channel to another. So we did get hit on the container port side with currency and we've had a number of increases that we've pushed through as we went through the first part of the year we haven't recovered all the currency impact. I'm not sure which slide you're looking at it if you're looking at the container business on page 31 most of what you see there is pretty small movements. And most of that is mix. We just experience. Should. We sell to a lot of customers or a lot of different types of boxes there is a fairly broad distribution of price given box construction. And so most of what you see there is mix on price as of the boxes were selling. Margins are margin structure from quarter to quarter was dead flat. Chris Manuel : Okay. Second question was if I can follow up from an earlier one as well. Have your customers approached you would all particular West Coast customers fruit and vegetable process etc. regarding, the drug has been an issue, if they come at you and suggest that any sense that we may have 510% lower needs given a shortages of water things of that nature. That's directionally some of the color we've heard regarding outlooks or thoughts regarding some of the crops, but your color would be helpful. Mark Sutton : We have not. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : So a lot of these things have been asked. Starting with one, obviously currency wasn't the problem on the bottom line. But the revenues missed the consensus pre-substantially. Some wondering if that is the FX and you can qualify the impact. Carol Roberts : Steve, the FX was a big factor translating those Brazilian sales in the euro sales in two dollars was a big impact. And that's the majority of it. Steve Chercover : And secondly down year-over-year sequentially and xpedx is discontinued op is a good run rate to use in the low 400s now? Mark Sutton : Can you say that again you broke up on the first part of the question? Steve Chercover : Selling and admin expenses are down year-over-year and sequentially. And I believe xpedx has already been discontinued so I wondering if a good run rate is now in the low 400 range? Carol Roberts : It probably is but think about the first quarter is probably a lower cost quarter because we have an annual increase that hits April 1. But there could be a little bit of movement it should be reasonable. The only other area there would be incentive comp can move around quarter to quarter and that is not insignificant. Steve Chercover : Final question, it's sounds like there is still some runway for Ilim after the work is done. Can we see that thing approach maybe $50 million as a line item quarter in quarter out? Carol Roberts : I would hesitate to quote a number. I would have to go back and do the math. One thing I would say because it is a pulp business it is going to be a bit of a cyclical is this your going to have some peaks that are going to be really awesome and you don't know when those might be, so it could be a very strong number that I would have to go back and look before I would speculate on where the earnings would be, but Jay would be a good one follow-up on that. Operator : And your final question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Mark, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the consumer packaging business following Riegelwood you have two world-class SBS Mills here, but you don't have the full converting capabilities few of your large publicly traded competitors. So as you look at this business long-term would you look to get bigger in converting or would you maybe looked continue to streamline the business. Is it strategically important to be an SBS long-term or you content to do with the asset base of now? Mark Sutton : The consumer packaging business not only in the U.S. but globally where we do it, we do some of that business in Europe. We do some in China. Is an important business for us. We are surgically targeted to certain segments with certain substrates. We don't have a full line of substrates we don't have a full line of converting and that seems to be working for us. In our recent history we've tried some other methods to grow that business with other types of converting. With varying degrees of success or lack thereof. So we\u2019re going to be very careful with how we look to grow that business, but it is an important business for us. We really like the North American SBS base business and the converting that we do. But again back to my earlier comments anything we do in consumer packaging or any of the other businesses we will have to be convinced that it drives the return on invested capital of the overall company. And even though we have two mill system or emerging into a two mill system SBS for packaging grades those are two enormous mills that have a significant capacity and product capability that are best in class in the world. So I don't go by the number of mills I look at the number of customers we serve and the growth rates of those customers and where we think we can add value and be competitive. And that will be the test we use on whether or not we grow and more converting. It's not, we just need to do it to be like every else, it's about value creation. Anthony Pettinari : And then just trying to Brazil top demand environment potentially higher taxes and tariffs on energy usages, given all those challenges is there a way to quantify the potential for EBITDA margin improvement at Orsa or to quantify that runway? And then putting aside some of the bad external things, what are the kind of the actions you can take internally at Orsa to improve performance of the business? Mark Sutton : The Brazil packaging business is in the same market, experiencing the same dynamics as our paper business. So demand has been a challenge. What we have done is we have improved internally how we're operating the mills that we have there. They are relatively small mills by our U.S. scale but they have the same kinds of challenges and problems so we are deploying our capabilities of manufacturing excellence and other tools we use to improve those mills. And we\u2019re seeing some results there. So internal self-help improvement on how we operate. And on the box plants it's a number of things. It's improving our capability to serve customers through the supply chain improvements and also adding a little bit of automation to lower our fixed cost and we are making progress on all those fronts. We\u2019re not losing position in our packaging business. We've got some really important customers that are having a tough go of it and so as their business contracts a bit we contract. So we've got to figure out the commercial side and replace some of that business but I think when the economy in Brazil improves, when the government reforms take hold the packaging business is going to be much better positioned to perform in a better environment than it was when we made the acquisition. Operator : At this time I'll turn it back for Mr. Royalty for closing remarks Jay Royalty : Okay thanks. That will conclude today's call. Thanks Mark and Carol and all. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always Michelle and I are available after the call and our phone numbers are on slide 19 of the presentation. Have a great day.

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the International Paper Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session. Now, it is my pleasure to hand the call over to, Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks a lot, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We'll also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone and thank you very much for joining our call to review our second quarter results and outlook for the third quarter. I'm going to start on slide 5. International Paper delivered another strong result in the second quarter. Our earnings per share was $0.97 compared with $0.93 last year. In addition to the EPS, free cash flow was substantial at $511 million in the quarter, up from $377 million last year. Earnings were driven by outstanding results in our North American Industrial Packaging business with EBITDA margin just over 24%. Operations performed well around the globe and we successfully executed 11 major maintenance outages across the entire enterprise. Solid performance continues at the Ilim JV, delivering equity earnings to IP of $67 million in the quarter. I'm also very pleased to report that the number-three containerboard machine at our Valliant facility is fully online and ahead of schedule. The product's qualified, the machine is running great. Finally, I'd note that our return on invested capital for the first half of 2015 exceeded 10%. All-in, I think a very strong quarter for International Paper. Moving to slide 6 and continuing with our financial results. As I mentioned, EPS was $0.97 for the second quarter. And when you set aside the benefit of the foreign exchange gain on Ilim's debt from both this year and last year, we had a year-over-year earnings per share growth of over 5%. Now, while revenue was down year-over-year in the quarter and most of that was due to FX impact from our Brazil and Europe operations, we continue to have strong margin performance in the face of several global macro headwinds. With that, I'd like to ask Carol to take us through more detail in the quarter and our outlook for the third quarter. I'll return at the end to wrap it up. Carol? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the first to second quarter, you can see that our performance was solid across the board. Pricing and mix were essentially flat with a few puts and takes, and we'll talk about that as we go through the segment. Volume was seasonally stronger predominantly in Industrial Packaging as we expected. Operations improved and were solid across the board. Maintenance outages, as Mark mentioned, were up significantly but in line with our expectation. Input costs were lower, which reduced energy and diesel costs being offset slightly by higher fiber costs. And finally, the Ilim JV created a positive swing as the FX benefit was partly offset by higher cost associated with the outages and some general inflation. Turning to the segments, I'm going to slide 8. As Mark mentioned, the Industrial Packaging segment delivered an exceptional quarter resulting in $528 million of EBIT. Prices were down slightly mostly on export containerboard volume as North American box prices, inclusive of mix, were essentially flat. Box margins in Europe were under continued pressure and did contribute $3 million to the decline. Volume for North American box was up 3% over the first quarter. Operations performed well and maintenance outages came in as expected. Input costs were sequentially favorable. Asia box continues to experience some very intense competitive pressures which further negatively impacted results by about $1 million. So overall, strong results from the Industrial Packaging team. Moving to slide 9, as Mark mentioned, the recently restarted and upgraded containerboard machine at Valliant is running very well and is fully ramped up and qualified within two months of start-up. This coincides well with the wind down of the purchase agreement that we've been operating under for the past few years. And this enables us to supply our own needs and our customers' needs at a lower total delivered cost. The project's on track and we continue to expect an IRR above 25%. On behalf of the business, I'm pleased to also announce that the board has approved a series of projects that like Valliant will enable us to further improve our world-class containerboard asset base. These projects totaling about $300 million of total investment across our system have a collective IRR of 20% and will further improve flexibility across the network, enhance our product quality, and reduce manufacturing and supply chain cost. We're excited about the benefits these investments will provide for our customers, the business and our shareowners. So, let me move on to Consumer Packaging, slide 10. In Consumer Packaging, as you can see on the slide, total segment earnings were down $12 million sequentially, of which about $10 million is attributable to our business in Asia where earnings were substantially lower as depressed demand and intense competitive pressures resulted in lower prices and volume. Earnings were also lower in Europe due to a number of unfavorable items including a lower volume, some higher operating expenses and the impact of unfavorable FX impact due to the weaker euro. Conversely, earnings in North America were higher due to seasonally stronger volume and lower maintenance outage expenses partially offset by lower prices and a slightly less favorable mix. Turning to slide 11, we wanted to provide an update on a couple of significant projects that are under way and that are focused on strengthening and creating more value in our North American Consumer Packaging business. First, the sale of the Carolina Coated Bristols brand is complete, and the transition of the Coated Paperboard business at Riegelwood into our world-class assets at Texarkana and Augusta is on track for later this year. Following that transition, we will begin the mill conversion project at Riegelwood, which will become 100% pulp, and activities to facilitate that conversion are under way now and on schedule. These changes will streamline and strengthen the Coated Paperboard business while improving and growing our world-class fluff pulp business. Secondly, the expansion of Kenton, Ohio, facility to support growth in our food service business is on schedule as well, with the facility expansion complete and equipment being moved in as we speak, and to be online within the next 90 days. This expansion will enable us to support the new business that we're being awarded by both existing and new customers that benefits both our Food Service Converting and Coated Paperboard businesses. Both of these moves reinforce our commitment to our customers in this important segment and will create long-term value for our shareowners. Moving to Printing Papers on slide 12. Earnings increased in our North American paper and pulp business due to a more favorable product mix, better operations, and lower input costs. And this was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expenses. Prices were higher in Europe, earnings were lower due to higher planned maintenance outage expenses. Brazil continues to be significantly impacted by the recession and reduced domestic demand that comes with that. Normally, we would have seen a pickup from the seasonally slower first quarter, but that did not materialize this year. Second quarter earnings were down $18 million year-over-year in our Brazilian business. And we do expect the current conditions to persist through at least this year and into next. Turning to Ilim on slide 13, the JV delivered another \u2013 a very solid quarter of results on increased volume and improved pricing. Costs were higher due to higher planned maintenance outage expenses and inflation. Operations continue to perform very well post the ramp-up of the major capital projects which were completed a year ago. As noted earlier, the FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt was favorable in the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV is expecting inflation headwinds to continue and to face some price pressure on softwood pulp in China. However, the outlook remains very favorable due to less maintenance outages, which will enable higher volumes and continued strong operation. So before I move to the outlook, just a couple of other highlights that I'd like to talk about. First, on slide 14, we raised $2 billion of new debt at an average coupon of 4.6%, and this was for two purposes. One was to fund a tender offer for $1 billion of existing debt with an average coupon of 7.5%. And secondly, to enable a $750 million contribution to the pension plan, which was voluntary. With both of these moves, we've clearly strengthened our already strong balance sheet. We've also been very active with the share buyback program in 2015, having bought back $420 million in shares year-to-date, which brings our total purchases against the $3 billion authorization to about $1.9 billion. So moving to the outlook for the third quarter on slide 15, volume will be seasonally higher in North America and Brazil Papers, while North American Industrial Packaging will be generally flat. We expect prices to be mostly stable across the board, with improving prices in European Papers offset by continued pressure in EMEA Packaging. We expect the challenging conditions in Asia to persist into the third quarter. We expect good operational improvement in North American Papers & Pulp, and some improvement in Brazil as well. We expect continued improvement in Industrial Packaging, due in part to Valliant start-up ramp-up cost not reoccurring in the third quarter and better performance in our Consumer Packaging business. All-in across our North American businesses, we expect this improvement to be around $25 million. Input cost will be a headwind in the third quarter as energy, OCC and rail rate increases hit the North America Packaging businesses by roughly $35 million. Brazil faces some additional headwinds as well, mainly on wood and electricity cost. Maintenance outage costs will be substantially lower, about $90 million, as we move from the heaviest to the lightest quarter of the year. As far as the Ilim JV, we expect operational earnings to improve due to fewer outrages in the third quarter, which will enable higher production and sales. IP's share of this expected operational earnings improvement in the third quarter is roughly $10 million. And for the purposes of forecast, we don't attempt to forecast FX, so we have here FX stable as of the end of the second quarter, so a non-repeat of the positive $0.06 FX impact. So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carol. I will pick it up from Carol on slide 16. Before I do the wrap-up and open it up for questions, I want just to spend a minute looking at margins across our major businesses around the world. I think this slide captures the strength of IP and the major positions we have in the key markets that we want to serve. The message here is that IP \u2013 the IP that we built today is less cyclical, and we continue to find ways to improve our position and our results. In the businesses where we have some significant headwinds, cyclical headwinds, I would add, like Brazil, for example, we are generally holding our own with very strong margins, and we'll come out of this recessionary environment a much stronger company. So in closing, moving to slide 17, International Paper continues to perform well and deliver results. When you look at what we're doing, given the severe headwinds in Brazil and in Asia, and with the strong dollar, it truly speaks of the strength and reliability of our company, and of our performance. Some of these challenges are more significant than we originally thought coming into the year. On the flipside, we're enjoying strong performance out of our Ilim JV, which Carol covered earlier. And that positively impacts our earnings. Outside of some of these select areas, the rest of the company is performing pretty well. Our margins, earnings, free cash flow, and our return on invested capital at a healthy spread above our cost of capital, are all evidence of this. We continue to achieve and grow our attractive margins through consistent execution and internal initiatives that are unique and value-creating to IP. We have a pipeline of accretive investment options, the Kwidzyn Coated Paperboard investments, the Valliant number 3 machine, those are two of the more recent ones, and there are more to come, as we highlighted today, all making good businesses a lot better. We are generating significant and reliable free cash flow year-after-year, and that enables us to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders through our dividend, our share buyback programs, as well as fund some of these attractive value-creating investments. Our capital allocation mission remains all about high-return generation for long-term value creation. That's our focus, and that's our commitment. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Thanks. Operator : Our first question comes from Steve Chercover with D. A. Davidson. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you, good morning. I had a question about the Sun joint venture in China. I noticed the JV partner is transferring its ownership and it's an acknowledgement that performance has been inadequate. So, does that have any implications for you? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. This is Mark. Yeah. The \u2013 what you saw there is our partner has a couple of different legal entities, and he's transferring some of the shares from the JV into another legal entity, perfectly allowable under our shareholder agreement. We're not satisfied with the performance. We've said that a number of calls now. China is really tough right now, overcapacity and some of the other challenges. But this transfer doesn't really affect our partnership. What we are doing is really working together with our partner in China to kind of manage the JV to the best possible outcome. And we're not finished with that work, but this particular transfer doesn't change the way we're going to operate or doesn't change our partnership. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: What I was wondering, if you were the sole owner of those assets, would you operate them differently? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We're \u2013 no. We're operating as a majority partner, we're operating the International Paper way. So, we're trying to make the profit maximizing decisions. So, that's why we're working on the high-end mix and really running our capacity to the orders that we want for the economics that are available. And I think we would do that and we do that in collaboration with our partner today. And we do it that way if we owned it all which is not our intent. But we wouldn't change a whole lot. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Well, that's good to know. So, ultimately, to use a phrase that you use, it comes down to industry structure in China. And then one other question, please, on Printing Papers. I just want to get a sense of what's going on domestically since it was amazing to me that the price and mix is up given what you said in Brazil. So, are things going better domestically, or it's just that you're getting out of some of the commodity businesses? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Steve, I'm going to ask Mike Amick who leads that business for us in North America to give you a perspective on that. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, Mike. W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hi. Good morning. This is Mike Amick. We're having a \u2013 domestically, both the quarterly performance as well as kind of year-over-year is improved. Once we're seeing strong relative growth domestically with our business almost a factor of three kind of year-over-year versus the market. So, it's a real good commercial story around the brands. Pricing is a little bit down domestically. But as you stated well, from a mix standpoint, we're overcoming a lot of that. So, it is a strong story. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Can you give a little bit more color on this $300 million capital program for Containerboard? Any sense of the timing? How many years that's going to lay out? And maybe a little bit more color on some of the work you're doing. And specifically, is it expected to have any sort of material positive (19:00) component? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. Hey, Gail. It's Tim. Yeah. The work \u2013 so, it's important because the work that we're doing will be done primarily as we go through our annual outages in the facilities that are affected. A lot of that work will start either very late this year or early next year and kind of go through the year. So, impact to the business and having the capability is more of a 2017 type of timeframe. You ask about capacity. What we're doing is we're actually making investments that give us the flexibility that we need. In some cases, it's around products and around geography, also around seasonality. So, these projects will add 250,000-plus tons to our system and that gives us the ability to optimize the system and make sure that we're supporting our customers in the best possible way. So, I think 2017 timing, most of these are fairly straightforward from a technical standpoint, so they'll be completed in the annual outages and then they will come up fairly quickly and give us the flexibility that we need mostly on a seasonal basis, but also from a product standpoint as well. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit about Consumer Packaging and the price weakness there? Specifically, was any of that and to what extent in the domestic market? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hi, Gail. This is Mike Amick. Can you repeat the question? It was breaking up a little. I didn't... Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I guess, some perspective on the Consumer Packaging market domestically. Were your issues really in the quarter predominantly international or was there any sort of weakness or softness in the U.S.? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Yeah, from a, domestically, we are seeing it is a little sloppy out there. From a shipment standpoint domestically, we're down about 2.5% versus where we think the industry is about 1.5% overall, but most of that is due to exports. So, we're, domestically feel pretty good about the Coated \u2013 the Coated Paperboard business. And most of the issues that were noted are international. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Gail, just let me add to Mike's. On the international piece, some of that was what we talked about earlier, the Asia piece is reported into Consumer Packaging, the Sun piece, and that was a significant piece of that. But also in Europe, we just had some onetime issues that are not chronic, just maintenance outages and some other onetime cost. So, the real international issue, if you will, from \u2013 impacting the results is what we talked about with Sun. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and the details. I guess maybe first start \u2013 first point, with the pension funding, Carol, what does this do to your required funding for the next several years if you haven't provided that in the past? Appreciate it. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. With this contribution, of course, a little bit will be dependent upon how the whole year ends, where the liability accounting goes and how the asset performance is. But generally speaking, I would say, this would, with our current projections, would push out any required contributions for the next three years. We wouldn't have anything required. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And, I mean, aside of the obvious where we saw that you were buying back stock even into the third quarter, could you update us perhaps a bit more in terms of your thoughts on that being an appropriate use of capital relative obviously to the balance use of capital for dividends? And I want to tie it back to some of your capital projects going on and then I'll turn it over after that. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, George, what we said, of course, is our capital allocation strategy is we're generating a lot of cash and we believe that that cash generation allows us to both return some of that cash to our shareowners through the form of the dividend and then we've talked about 30% to 40% of free cash flow through the dividend. We also have said that there's an opportunity to return cash through the buyback and that we would use the buyback, targeted opportunistically. And that also still, we believe we have enough cash flow then to also fund the good ideas. And we talked about some of those today. And so I think you'll continue to see us progress along that pathway. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But I guess, the fact that we saw you buy back more in the third quarter, does that suggest you see more opportunity with the shares here or this is just part of your normal program and balanced approach? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : (24:05) once again, as we said, it's part of our normal program. And we're going to make our decisions as we go. We're going to be opportunistic. And we're going to balance all those needs as we think about today and as we look forward. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Last question. And, I'll turn it over. Can you \u2013 you've mentioned the returns on the $300 million worth of projects and you mentioned some of the reasons you're bringing it in within Industrial Packaging. Now, as we look at it, you said you're also adding within this about 250,000 tons of capacity in a market that I recognize you, take a longer term view than a quarter or two, that has been perhaps, at least from the vantage point of some people, a little bit softer than would've been expected. You, in fact, had to take some economic downtime in the quarter from the data that you had in the slide deck, I think around 55,000 tons. So, help us understand why, while adding flexibility, you're also adding capacity, why that is the right move in Industrial Packaging market where there's been a little bit of choppiness here in the last couple of quarters. Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. Hey, George, it's Tim. Well, I think... George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello, Tim. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hey. We do take a longer-term view. We believe that the market will grow over time. If you wait until the growth occurs, to make these types of investments, you've waited too late. So, we're running a very large, very complicated system. And the way we think about it is, how do we optimize, maximize margins sustainably over time. So, this just gives us more capability across the system to run it the way we need to. And these are the types of projects that we look for on a continual basis. So, we'll be looking for more of them. This is one of the ways that we think we can create shareowner value. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Tim, do you anticipate the returns would cover inflation at least? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Oh, yeah. I mean, these are 20% returns. These are three times cost of capital. So... George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. We'll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Sticking kind of on that, the capital allocation line of question, can you give us a bit of sense of an update of where you think cap spend might be next year? I realize you don't have any finalized plans probably, but a preliminary sense and what the run rate for the next couple of years might be in your opinion at this juncture? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Mark, Carol. We told you that for 2015, I think we said our CapEx targeted about $1.5 billion, and we said that was the plan. We've not finalized our plans for 2016. And as we've talked about it, if we have these ideas that are \u2013 the bigger ideas that are value-creating, we'll balance that against the overall needs of the system. So, without giving you a 2016 number, it's logical to think that there could be an uptick in 2016 due to the significance of this level of project in our best business. But we'll firm that up when we get to \u2013 probably talk about the third quarter and then into the beginning of next year. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. As we think about the spend, how much of it is going to the 20%-plus type of return projects versus how much of it is more environmental, maintenance with lower returns? How might we think about that? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, as we've talked about it \u2013 and again, these are round numbers, we provide a lot of this information, and it changes a little bit. If you think about the company, about $1 billion for maintenance regulatory on an ongoing basis to take care of the fleet we have today. And then if you think about the balance, the $400 million to $500 million, about half of that would go to what we would call, let's say strategic projects. A great example of that would be the expansion of Chem (28:22). Strategically, growing that business. You could talk about that as the Riegelwood conversion, strategic project to, say, grow and then strengthen the fluff business. And then the balance, which would be \u2013 and that would have \u2013 that would be returned capital \u2013 and then the balance, the $200 million or so would \u2013 $200 million to $250 million, would go towards high return cost reduction projects. And the returns on those projects are 30% plus. That's been the capital allocation for the company. But once again, if we get good ideas where there's a bigger opportunity, like we've talked about in the Industrial Packaging business, it'll have to be balanced against those other things. And one of the things that we'll think about is, if we can deploy capital at good returns that's value creating, we're going to stay constrained on CapEx, but we're not going to slow ourselves down intentionally when that's not a good idea. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That was really helpful. Thank you. And just one other one, if I could. Couple years ago, you had the annual Investor Day. And when you first mapped out the capital allocation strategy, you talked about ramping the dividend up pretty quickly for a few years and then probably getting to a more moderated rate. And I think that, at the time, you kind of talked about like a three-year ramp in the dividend. And I think this would have been the third year. Is that still the way we should be anticipating things, that we have one more sizeable ramp in the dividend before most likely moving into a more metered increase? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You know, Mark, I would never predict what the dividend will be, of course that's Mark and the board to decision that, but our strategy is pretty clear. We said, as we can grow the earnings and the cash flow of the company, that the dividend's an important part of that, and we'll evaluate that. We said the dividend is going to be meaningful, incremental, predictable and then there'll be an opportunity to reevaluate that at the right time. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO Market. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Carol. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): To just to kind of follow on Mark's question. You guys have had a 5% EBITDA growth target sitting out there. Any updated thoughts on that? It looks like it will be a challenge for this year, just judging from the first half. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Mark. This is Mark. That's a great word. I think it's \u2013 another way to ask that is how realistic it is. It's definitely a challenge for this year. That 5% EBITDA growth target that I talked about before we started the year, as we headed into the year, had a certain set of economics assumptions attached to it, some of which are not materializing. So, yeah. It makes it pretty difficult. It was a bit aspirational, as I mentioned in follow-up discussions. But that's the kind of growth level we need to be shooting for as a company, to really produce the kind of returns our investors expect. It won't be an even process, obviously. But as we talked about in the results, we're pulling every lever we can with the company we have, and we're going to continue to shoot for levels like that. But it's definitely a challenge with some of the economic activity we see in Brazil, for example, being in a \u2013 I would say, a much deeper recession than we probably considered going in. And China being a challenge. Those two areas alone, and stepping back a bit instead of moving forward, take a big chunk out of the ability to do that. Earnings per share, on the other side, it's not one metric. Earnings per share, it's also important and that is up in that neighborhood year-to-date. And what is probably our overall guiding principle for long-term value creation, which is ROIC, we've got that in a zone that we want to be in, a couple hundred basis points above our cost of capital, and we'd like to be able to show that, through good times and bad times, we've got a company that's flexible enough to really sustain that, and generate that near $2 billion in cash, and have that be something that investors can depend on. So, yeah, challenging is a good word for the 5% EBITDA goal. But we don't give up easily. So, we'll keep working on it. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. I'm glad to hear that. And Mark, I wondered if I could also get you to just maybe take two steps backward. We're at a period where we've got a lot of big foreign exchange moves out there. And I wondered, if you look across the IP portfolio right now, where would you say the foreign exchange movements are creating the greatest stress, or the greatest changes, in your business? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We got \u2013 we've got several impacts and, obviously, Carol is tracking that for us. There are puts and takes, and some of them are not completely intuitive, but I'll ask Carol to kind of give our summary of the overall. And then if there's a specific area, we've talked about Containerboard and some of those long-term demand issues, be happy to comment on that. But Carol, the overall summary? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. So, the easiest one to do the math on, and it is a headwind for us, is strictly the earnings that we get out of Europe, and the earnings that we get out of Brazil, are coming in a currency that's weaker. So when we convert that to dollars, there's less. And so, as we talked, the first quarter call, we said a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar is a $50 million-type headwind. That's probably still pretty good math, and we know the dollar has strengthened more than that. So that's the easy math. Where it diverges, and it depends, is the currency in a country, how it impacts the market access and the competitiveness. In the case of Russia, the weak currency has been great. We're doing well there. We make in rubles. We sell in dollars. We've got margin expansion. And then conversely, in Brazil, it's actually been \u2013 hurt us. So, you got a good guy. You got a bad guy. And then in the U.S., we are exporting 20% of what we produce, and so while we're able to export our products, our margins are down. So, long answer is, there's pluses and takes on the market side. But overall, a stronger dollar is a headwind for International Paper, and it's probably a bit more of a headwind than when we first anticipated. But we're managing through it, I think, quite well. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And I just -just a couple of follow-ons on the FX impact? One is, you've talked over time about wanting to export kraft linerboard from the U.S. to supply your offshore operations. I wondered, is the dollar strengthens, whether that strategy is shifting at all? And then I wondered if you could comment on some reports we've gotten of containerboard imports coming in from Europe and from Australia? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hey, Mark. It's Tim. No. It doesn't change the strategy. Currency moves up, it moves down over time. As Carol mentioned, it has hit our margins in certain places, but we believe in the channel for the long term. So \u2013 and we make good money in the channel. So, we would make more if the dollar was weaker, but we still like the business that we have today. And so, if it changes dramatically from where it is, we can always reevaluate, but nothing that's happened that changes it today. Australian paper, I think we've had some market reports of West Coast activity, but not in a major or significant way that I'm aware of. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. And, anything on the East Coast? I'd been hearing a little bit about maybe some European paper, Tim? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hadn't heard it, no. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. That's helpful. Good luck in the second half. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Just two things. I wonder if you could tell us how significant the system optimization impact of Valliant might be. I'm thinking in a system as big as yours that the impact is going to be pretty regional, but it is in a pretty important region, so I'm just wondering if you could scale that for us. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. What it does for us is it gives us a product we need overall and certainly in a geography. So, it helps us as we shift down \u2013 product down into Texas. It helps us with the West Coast, and it also helps us with the Midwest. So, this 360,000 tons we're running primarily medium, which we're short on medium to begin with. So, it's a product we need and it's freight-advantaged to the places we need to get to. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just one other question, how is Orsa doing and is that a place where you're likely to find attractive reinvestment? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi Mark. It's Mark Sutton. Orsa is living in a containerboard and box market that tracks GDP exactly. So, GDP is heading toward minus 2 plus a little bit and that's what we're seeing in demand. So, we've got some big customers that are in special segments that are probably doing a little worse than GDP. One of them is the electronic segment, big year last year with the World Cup and televisions, a soft year this year. And we've got big poultry and protein customers that are having issues with the regional drought. So, demand is down. The good news is on the internal improvements, efficiency in our box plants and in the containerboard mills made a lot of improvement. So, further investment, I mean we'll keep our eyes and ears open. We really do need to get the improvements that we think we can get even with a difficult economy at Orsa before we go to a next step, but we are improving internally. The market's challenging, though. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. But it sounds like the assets are running pretty well. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We are \u2013 I mean, we've made some improvements on the mills and the box plants. We've done a lot of best practice transfer from our U.S. system which has really taken hold. And so, we're making some improvements that we can keep \u2013 hold and keep and we need to get the commercial piece \u2013 commercial piece up. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Very good. Thank you. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Carol, just one quick clarification. You mentioned the prepayment on the pension plan would prevent the need for having to make a contribution for three years. Not to be picky, is that \u2013 does that include 2018 or are we talking 2015, 2016, and 2017? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, I was talking 2016, 2017, 2018 generally speaking. Still, things can change so, but under the assumptions we would have today. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I understand. Got you, interest rates, et cetera. And then on the CapEx, you mentioned this year you're spending, I believe you said around \u2013 depreciate (39:47) $1.5 billion or so. Would the projects and the good ideas you talked about including the Industrial Packaging $300 million initiative, does that alone, given the pace you expect that to take, likely take that number up for next year or would you have to find some other things? And I'm thinking there might perhaps be some offset from the Boiler MACT situation, I'm not sure when that actually phases out. But maybe you could let us know how that looks right now. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And that's why I said we haven't finalized our numbers for 2016, but with the slug of capital of that size coming in, a very important project. It's likely that it would be \u2013 might be difficult to maintain the spending at the one-size level, because we might not want to. I mean, what we want to be careful about is not delaying some really good ideas that are the cost improvement ideas. So, we'll look at it, we're going to stay in a capital constrained environment. We're going to be very judicious. But we're going to want to make sure that we can run the system the way we want to. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. And this is one for Tim. You know I know with the, you mentioned the volume. I think, Carol, in her comments, was up in boxes about 3%, if I'm not mistaken, year-to-year. And as you look at your system and I think about the whole country and the continent really not adding, to note, any virgin-quality linerboard. Are you all having to pull tons in from offshore because the industry data don't seem to suggest that, or has so far you've been able to get those extra tons by flexing your system? And I suppose as you look at 2016, if we see another similar type growth year and kind of before this incremental tons come on, could you see yourself in a situation where you might have to pull some tons from offshore back into the states? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : No. I mean, situational, Chip, a moment in time but I don't think so. I mean, I think we have a pretty flexible system. We're adding to that flexibility, so that we can do what we need to do. And you mentioned the 3%. That was sequential not year-over-year. But, yeah, generally, we have a more favorable view on longer term growth, and we want to make sure that we are doing now what is needed for future periods. So, that's the reason for some of this investment. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then the last one I suppose for Mark. I noticed the U.S. portion of the Consumer Packaging business and it's great that you gave us that detail because the overall segment was down, but certainly the U.S. part was up nicely year-to-year. And I suppose some of the initiatives there including food service are helping. Is that business sort of seen as a rising star within IP, the domestic Consumer Packaging business, or even though it appears its returns are still below the other major segment, Industrial Packaging, it still has a ways to go? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Chip, this is Mark. I think Consumer Packaging in North America, as we've said, is an important business for us. We've got some really, really good customers both on the coated board side with the high-end SBS grades that we make in the U.S. and on the converting side with our cup business. And it is growing and it is a business we think we can improve, I mean, really, Riegelwood was kind of a double, not a single. We're improving our fluff pulp business, but that also improves our Consumer Packaging business by putting all of our board production in two of the best mills in the world instead of spreading it across three. And we're growing our Food Service business and continuing to look at strategic options to kind of improve that business. And so, it is important to us. International Paper increasingly is moving in more packaging. And Consumer Packaging, we made the investment in Kwidzyn in Europe for high-end board and that's working out really well. And you mentioned Food Service here in the U.S. and it is \u2013 I don't know about a rising star, we don't use those terms, but it is a business we're excited about. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Scott. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just going back to these capital investments. Mark, you talked about your view of market growth going forward, I guess, the market's been relatively flat at least in North America over the last few years. Can you talk about what's driving that view for potential market growth as maybe as we move in, later into 2016 and 2017? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Scott. I think one of the things we kind of probably need to just step back on, we've talked about our Industrial Packaging business as a multichannel business. So, we've got a Containerboard business that underpins the Industrial Packaging business. And we view containerboards \u2013 the kraft liner component of Containerboard as a global \u2013 globally competitive product that the U.S. south is blessed with the right fiber to be globally competitive and we're the largest producer of that. So, we've had long-term strategic outlets throughout the world, not because our price is good or our price is bad, because they need the product. So, when we talk about investing in our Containerboard system, think outside of just the U.S. market, we're thinking about all channels. Our own box business, the open market customers we have which are fantastic customers in North America and the open market in IP-owned box plants overseas and non-IP box plants. That's the premise we start with, not the 1% or 2% or lack thereof in the U.S. market. And, the other thing you got to remember is we're always going to have fluctuations in a converting value-add business. We're going to make the product for the orders we have in all three of those channels. We've got seasonality with maintenance outages. So, we end up having to manage inventory differently. A lot of things that Tim described make that business better. And if there's growth, we capture it, absolute growth. If there's not growth, we lower our cost by making some other decisions down the road, what with capital or other types of decisions. So, it's a win-win strategy of making a really good business better. And I don't think about it as a domestic issue of the box market in the U.S. driving every one of these decisions. And we've shown that quarter after quarter after quarter, in good FX times, bad FX times. When a product is good and it's needed, it works. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I appreciate that. And then on the returns from these projects, the 20% IRR, how much of that is driven by internalization of tons that you're currently buying in the market versus this overall system optimization strategy? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. It's a mix of all those things. It's making more of the volumes that we've had to buy in the past as the agreement comes to the end, but it's also cost reductions, not only fixed because of the volume but variable as well. So, these projects, they help improve quality. They give us the flexibility we need. Just to add on one point that Mark made, we're running a system where the way we think about servicing that system across all the channels is pretty critical. And the carrying costs on a few incremental tons of inventory to support our system is pretty low versus the operational cost of not having what you need, where you need it, when you need it. We're trying to make decisions two months and three months out on somewhere between 12,000 SKUs and 15,000 SKUs of board that get used on any given day. And so, if we're wrong by 1% in terms of accuracy, it's costing us $10-plus-million to fix all of that, and sometimes a lot more. So, all of these projects not only give us incremental capacity in a given region for a given product, but they help us manage and optimize that system. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the answers. Good luck in the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Just a follow-up on the containerboard system optimization. When you look at the capacity that you'll add, not only the 250,000 tons but maybe even thinking about opportunities for growth three years to five years beyond that. Does the opportunity to add low cost capacity come from debottlenecking existing sites, or do you see a potential to repurpose assets that are producing other substrates, like white paper? And then just beyond containerboard, looking at fluff, following Riegelwood, can you talk about conversions generally? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Anthony, this is Mark. I think we've got opportunities in, when you look at our asset base, and I've commented on this before, we've got very, very good assets in really all of our businesses. They happen to make the product they make today, but can be reconfigured to make other products, and we've got the right work force, the right technical age of the assets, and what's probably more important than anything on the cost side, is the right fiber basket. So, we've got opportunities, a lot of opportunities in the company, to make our good businesses better by organic debottlenecking, as you mentioned, but also by facility conversions. There's further opportunity in fluff if we need it, and our customers need it. There's opportunities in converting assets that are currently making one type of product to make another type of product. And that's one of the benefits we have is, we have a lot of choices about how to do strategic projects that help our existing businesses. We built what we have by big M&A activity. And what we didn't say is, we want to just kind of be satisfied with what we have. We want it to be the absolute best it can be. And now we're investing in what we built, in one way through M&A, we're investing in ourselves now by making what's really, I think, competitive and good, great. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Just to clarify, is the 250,000 tons coming from existing containerboard mills, or could those \u2013 that 250,000 tons potentially come from another source? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : These investments are coming \u2013 that Tim described and that Carol described in the opening comments \u2013 are coming from our existing containerboard system. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I just had a question on the North American uncoated freesheet market. I mean, it's like we're hearing some conflicting things with anti-dumping duties potentially next month. It sounds like some importers have backed off from shipping into the U.S. but, at the same time, RISI had some price cuts last week. Is the uncoated freesheet market, in terms of pricing in North America, is it getting better, is it getting worse? Is it stable? I was wondering if you could just provide any color there. W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hi. This is Mike Amick. And you see the \u2013 in terms of the pricing, we have seen a little bit of slippage. But in the context of the anti-dumping, overall the \u2013 you're seeing or maybe hearing some of the same things we are, this will play out over the coming months. In August, we expect to hear a ruling on the anti-dumping. And we've \u2013 but right now, things are pretty stable. Our business right now, domestically, is pretty strong. Little of that is actually coming from what we would consider to be a tailwind from the case itself. This is just continuing to be the strengthening of our business and our brands, which is very encouraging. So, I think we'll see this play out over the next 60 days or 90 days. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Chris. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I kind of want to come back to \u2013 you've touched on this a couple different ways, but I just want to kind of maybe probe a little more about it. When we look at your box shipments, first quarter, second quarter, they were down 1% each. I know industry's been up. Maybe, is that some related to just mix or timing or \u2013 you've been now a couple quarters below industry. And then two, kind of in relation with adding capacity and doing some work there, right? Clearly, you're, at least the data I'm looking at, shows your corrugated shipment's up. So, there's more going to export and other places. But when you think about balancing that, it sounds like \u2013 just maybe help me understand the process of, you want to have the right grades, the right places, so maybe it's \u2013 even though you're going to have it, you don't necessarily operate it. You take more downtime in it? Am I thinking about that the right way as well? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Well, we run what we need to run to service the customers that we have. So, yeah. In a moment in time, I see the perspective of there being a contradiction there. But on the box side, it's all the things you mentioned. We made some choices about customers late last year that kind of went through the pipeline, and exited our portfolio of customers earlier this year, and some of the newer business that's coming in is, as we mentioned last quarter, is ramping up over a period of time. So ,yeah. In a given quarter or a given moment in time, you can have some of these disconnects, but we do believe that our business grows over time, and we want to make sure that we're supporting that growth the most economical way. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is it your anticipation then that, probably as we get towards the end of the year or maybe into 4Q, that you'll begin to track sort of more in line with industry levels? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Well, it depends on what the market does. We know we have a pipeline of business coming in. We know that we have a customer portfolio that is performing at various levels. In some cases, some of the customers that we have are suffering their own market-related issues around share and the type of products that they make. So \u2013 but yes. Generally speaking, we would expect that over time, we would track closer to market. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Carol, in the past you've talked about your capital spending plans that being in the \u2013 you hit about a $1 billion or so of maintenance, but being a $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion kind of those extra spending elements helped offset inflation in different components that way. With the identification of some of the new projects and then this year I think you were already a bit elevated, should we think about as a whole across your system if you're spending $1.5 billion or so this year, and I think you kind of hinted that potentially it could be even taking a little tick up next year, that as a whole, you're spending more than offsets inflation or is there something you're seeing potentially on the inflation side that you think might be a bigger hole to offset? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Chris, I think you really hit it on the head at the end. And once again, you step back from our capital allocation strategy. We have said we're going to return a lot of our free cash to our investors, which we're doing. But there's cash left. You can reinvest that cash in acquisitions which we've done, some with great success and some with challenges. Or we could take some of that cash and reinvest that cash into businesses that are above cost of capital returns to create even more value. And we've been talking about this. So, the anticipation is, is that incremental investment is for earnings growth. It's to do more than offset inflation. We think about that base spending as the kind of things we need to do, that $1.4 billion level, $1.4 billion , $1.5 billion and it just depends point in time of some the maintenance expense we have about as a sustain level to kind of just keep pace. But what we're seeing, what you're seeing us do now is reinvest in businesses that we have a right to win and to create more value. Not just to stay still. And we think that given where we sit as a company right now, that deploying some capital in that direction might possibly make more sense than say what we've done in the past which is spend it on a bolt-on acquisition. But at the end of the day, it's cash being deployed to create to value. I hope that kind of answers your question and kind of puts a face on this incremental capital that we're talking about. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : It does. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. You took some economic downtime 2Q in your Containerboard business. Can you kind of help us frame what your expectation is in 3Q and then back half in general? Are you comfortable with your inventory levels? I appreciate you know. You guys obviously have transportation (58:02). But just kind of help frame how should we be thinking about it sequentially in Q3? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hey Philip. It's Tim. As a general rule, we don't forecast how we're going to run our system going forward, but the philosophy is that we try to maximize our earnings performance given all of the \u2013 if you heard earlier, all the considerations that we take into account, about how to have the product we need in the right place at the right time. And so, the downtime that we took, export channel was a little bit softer than we had anticipated in the second quarter. And so, we balanced our system out to account for that. That's just how we run it. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Got you. And can you help frame how you thinking about box demand in the back half? I appreciate you got some new business coming in. And, Mark, you mentioned earlier, coming in the year, there's a more upbeat outlook on the macro. Obviously, Brazil and China slowed down a bit. But just curious to get your thoughts on the U.S. economy and box shipments, broadly? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah, for \u2013 this is Tim again. For the indicators that we look at, we still think the second half of the year is going to be pretty good. We think that 2015, from a box demand standpoint, should be a fairly solid year. Now, we're not talking about 2.5% or 3% growth but in that 1% to 2% range based on the indicators we look at. Those indicators, obviously, get a lot fuzzier the further you look out in time. But here, in the immediate future, we still are somewhat encouraged by market growth. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then when you think about the investments you guys are making, you're obviously stepping a lot of that for internal investment. Is that a, kind of a reflection on how your pipeline was looking for M&A? And do some of your recent investments abroad on the M&A front, has that kind of set the hurdle rate a little higher going forward if you, do you approach M&A abroad? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Phil, that's a great question. And, what we've been saying is \u2013 what guides our investment strategy is creating value. And we've done a little bit of everything. Large M&A, as Carol said, some of it's worked out very well. Some smaller things in developing markets that are still a question mark or have not worked out very well. And because of that, we haven't done as much, other than cost reduction, as much of reinvesting into some own organic businesses. The Containerboard business is a great example. We didn't have that business to invest in several years ago. But we have it now and it's the best opportunity to create value of all the choices we have. So, it's not so much that the hurdle rate's changed. It's back to what guides us, and we believe we can create more value for the long term, which our shareholders should appreciated by making these investments instead of some other choices. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Very helpful, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. You guys have highlighted a lot of expected investment in North America. Mark, in the past you've talked about potential for investment in containerboard in Russia through your Ilim JV. Can you just talk about or frame this opportunity and whether or not it's something you'd be considering for 2016, or is this something we'd be looking at as more of a three-year or five-year time horizon? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, obviously, the investments in Ilim are a process with the Ilim board, which we, of course, are members of. But we do make some containerboard in Ilim and it's going very well. And Russia is a great soft wood basket. But right now the focus on Ilim is really getting the maximum potential of the investments we've already made, in specifically the Bratsk pulp mill, and that's going very well. And so, Ilim has a Board and a CEO and we're involved in that and strategy is being developed. But Russia is a great place for containerboard from a fiber standpoint. More logistics issues have to be solved over time. But we have a small position in containerboard through our Ilim joint venture and it's going well. But there is no imminent next move. It's really optimizing what we're doing right now and that's going well. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And, just one last one on printing paper. Your maintenance target for the year seem to come back I think primarily related to Brazil and North America. Is there anything that we should read into that there, anything being pushed out? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : No, not \u2013 This is Mike Amick, Debbie. This, our maintenance, for the large part, at least (1:02:41) the biggest piece of our maintenance is behind us in the first half. We still have some \u2013 a couple of outages here in the second half, but nothing is being pushed out in North America. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : No, the maintenance outages outside of North America, they move around based on what we're trying to accomplish in the particular outage and then managing, obviously, seasonality issues with customers. Some of the mills like Kwidzyn are comingled with coated board products. And so, that is another market that drives the timing decision. But, no, I wouldn't read anything into that. We're continuing to do our maintenance outages to make sure that what we run is, first and foremost, safe and reliable and can make it between outages in the best possible, lowest cost way. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Debbie. Operator : Our final question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Market. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Holy cow, snuck in there. Just two easy questions. One on the Pulp side, realizations in North America were up $8 quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering, is that a mix issue? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : That, it is a, primarily driven by mix. We had a little bit better performance in our fluff system which was able to generate some, obviously, improvement from that standpoint. So, primarily, yes, Paul. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just over on India with Printing Papers, lost money again in the quarter. Is there a longer-term plan here to reverse the slide? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Paul, yeah. The India business \u2013 the volume is growing. We've got \u2013 we've had some cost issues. And so, there is a plan to improve the business. And as we said originally, what we're trying to figure out with the Paper business in India is we're trying to figure out the market and what our participation level could be in the future. Some of the India numbers that we report are really other activity that we have beyond just the Paper business that just \u2013 is kind of the carrying cost when you start in a new region. But the underlying demand and how we're running has improved. But we definitely have that in this overall review that I've talked about doing with our portfolio. And India, like everything, else is a part of that. And we're making progress on that. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the help. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A portion for today's presentation. I will now hand the program back over to Jay for any closing remarks. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Well, that concludes the call. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call, and our numbers are on slide 18 of the appendix. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining the International Paper Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a great day.",

(Broker) Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co. Operator : Good morning. My name is Patrick, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now return the call over to Jay Royalty, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jay, the floor is yours. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of the presentation. We'll also present non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'm going to start on slide five. International Paper delivered another quarter of strong results with earnings per share of $0.97 in the third quarter. Earnings were driven by outstanding results in our North American Industrial Packaging business with EBITDA margins of 25.2%. Solid performance continues at the Ilim joint venture resulting in record operational EBITDA in the quarter. Additionally, IP received a $35 million dividend from Ilim in the third quarter. And finally, our return on invested capital continues to be strong with year-to-date results above 10%. On capital allocation we increased our dividend by 10% to $1.76 per share effective with the fourth quarter payout. Along with that we revisited and improved our dividend payout guidelines. Also we completed the restructuring and are extending the 2006 timber monetization. Carol will share more on these important items later in the call. And finally, we recently made a significant strategic decision that impacts how we will serve the important Asian market moving forward. Relative to closing the deal to sell our stake in the Sun joint venture, we have received the required government approvals and we expect to fully close the deal in the fourth quarter. Moving to slide six and continuing with our financial results, revenue was down year-over-year in the quarter as it has been all year; primarily this is due to the impact of FX translation. We also took a large noncash accounting charge of $0.15 in the quarter due to the decline in the value of the Russian ruble versus the dollar and that's primarily on Ilim's U.S. denominated net debt. More importantly or most importantly, I should say, we had a strong EBITDA quarter at almost $1.1 billion and with margins above 19%, strong free cash flow of $512 million and a return on invested capital of over 10%. So a good quarter and with that, I'll turn it over to Carol and ask her to cover the details on the quarter, also our outlook for the rest of the year and some comments on capital allocation. I'll return at the end to wrap up the call before we go into Q&A. Carol? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second quarter to third quarter you can see that our performance overall was fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter. The largest changes involve the noncash charge associated with the Ilim JV's U.S. dollar denominated net debt and that was due to the significant decline in the value of the ruble during the quarter. This more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. Pricing was impacted by lower containerboard export pricing and unfavorable price mix on Coated Paperboard and papers. Overall across the businesses, volume was generally flat. We had solid operations in the quarter, and as expected, input costs were higher in the areas of energy, OCC and rail expense. The other category includes a favorable FX gain from Brazil, and as mentioned earlier, the Ilim JV performed very well with strong operations that positively contributed $0.04 per share. Turning to the segments on slide eight, Industrial Packaging continued its string of strong quarterly results, delivering $553 million of EBIT. Lower planned maintenance outage expense was the biggest driver of increased earnings in the quarter. Export containerboard prices continue to be under some pressure and we believe this is primarily due to the strong dollar. Volume was impacted by lower containerboard export tons and seasonal softness in Europe. Absolute box volume in our North American Box business is flat. Operational performance was solid and input costs were higher as I mentioned as we expected. Turning to slide nine, IP continues to enjoy industry-leading margin performance, as Mark mentioned, driven by the excellent execution of our North American Industrial Packaging team and this includes their commercial efforts. As you can see on the top right portion of this slide, we've made significant progress in closing the gap to industry box shipments over the last two quarters. This is due to new business wins we're securing, growth with our existing customers through winning in their respective segments and our significant presence in segments which are growing faster than the industry average. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, we're seeing positive growth trends in Online Retail and Distribution, Agricultural products and Beverage. Protein is a segment that's important to us and that has recently struggled but it is showing signs of resumed growth. Processed Foods is a large segment that continues to be challenged as consumer preferences are shifting. But overall we're encouraged by our results and the trends we're seeing as we move into the fourth quarter. Turning to Consumer Packaging, earnings were higher due to lower planned maintenance outage expense and improved operations. While volume was up slightly in both North America and Europe, it was weaker than we expected for this time of year. We did experience softer backlogs in North America which we view as a result of customer destocking across the industry. And we also experienced some price pressure on plate stock along with a less favorable mix in North America. Turning to slide 11. It was a very good quarter for our Printing Papers business with earnings up $78 million. We had seasonally stronger volume, lower planned outage expense and stronger operations, and these were the key drivers. This was partially offset by lower price mix in North American Paper, a bit less favorable pulp mix and an increase in Russian exports. Looking at Slide 12, I'd like to take a minute to highlight a business that I think really shows the strength of IP's competitive position and that's our Brazilian Paper business. As we all know Brazil faces a host of challenges right now as it's in the midst of a very deep recession. What I think gets lost relative to IP is the fact that despite the current situation, our Papers business continues to perform very well and continues to generate strong EBITDA margin above 30%. Despite the weak domestic economy we've implemented one round and are working on a second round of domestic price increases which are helping to offset weak domestic demand as well as increased inflation. Additionally our export position is stronger than ever due to our strengthened competitive position and the benefit of the currency devaluation to our cost position. We expect to build on the momentum we saw in the third quarter as we move through the fourth quarter as volumes seasonally strengthen and we implement the second round of domestic price increases. Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered record operational EBITDA, as Mark mentioned, in the third quarter and this was all around strong operations and increased volume. Production at the Bratsk mill was at a record levels in the third quarter, exceeded the capital project targets that we had set. As noted earlier, the JV did take a large, non-cash charge in the quarter for the decline in the value of the ruble primarily related to the JV's U.S. denominated debt. As Mark mentioned, we did receive a dividend payment from the JV in the quarter of $35 million. Looking ahead, the JV is expecting seasonally higher volumes to be offset by lower average pulp prices and higher input costs in the fourth quarter. So moving to the fourth quarter outlook, volume in North America will be lower due to primarily three less shipping days in the North American Box business and seasonally lower specialty sales. This will impact North American Industrial Packaging results by about $35 million. Volume will also be impacted by fewer shipping days in North American Consumer Packaging. We expect seasonally stronger volume as I mentioned in the Brazil Paper business. We expect pricing to be relatively stable for the businesses; however, we do see a less favorable seasonal mix across our North American Paper, Pulp and Packaging businesses. Operational costs will be a headwind in the quarter relative to the third quarter. Part of this stems from the flooding that we saw in South Carolina earlier this month which impacted both our Eastover and Georgetown mills. Additionally, with the lower demand expected in North America due to fewer shipping days combined with starting to move into the winter months across the U.S., operational costs will be higher as will energy expenses. We expect the impact to the North American Paper and Pulp business to be roughly $25 million and that does include the impacts from the flood and the operational impact that had. We expect similar seasonality issues to impact the North American Packaging business by roughly $20 million. And relative to input costs, we expect energy expenses for the North American businesses to be about $10 million higher in the fourth quarter. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $45 million as shown on the slide. And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. So the fourth quarter outlook assumes a non-repeat of the $0.15 charge we incurred in 3Q. So shifting gears before I turn it back over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on capital allocation and how we think about this important area. This has been a consistent message and we've continued to refine our thinking and our approach relative to driving the greatest value for our IP and for our shareholders. To start, of course cash from operations enabled IP to fund all of these important elements so our focus continues to be on maximizing cash generation. Looking at the top left portion of the slide, one of the most important aspects of our capital allocation philosophy is to systematically return a significant portion of our cash to shareholders. As Mark mentioned, we've revisited the trough-test for our dividend. And based on a higher level of confidence around the sustainability of our cash flow, we have increased the target payout from the previously noted 30% to 40% now to 40% to 50% of our free cash flow. Opportunistic share buybacks as we've been doing since we instituted the first authorization roughly two years ago remains a very important part of this element of our strategy. Thoughtful and effective capital spending is another critical element. We're generating strong results and are committed to running a socially responsible company. And to maintain that level of excellence requires a base load of maintenance and regulatory spending. Beyond that, we look at high return cost reduction projects that help to offset inflationary costs and that enable IP to maintain and increase our competitiveness. Next, we intend to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet and that includes an investment-grade credit rating. We believe this is important to maintain the financial strength and flexibility needed to go through the good times and the not so good times. And finally, we continue to look for ways to increase the value of IP through reinvestment. This is all about opportunities that have healthy spreads above our cost of capital and importantly improve IP's strategic position. So given that cash from operations funds the important elements of our capital allocation strategy that I just spoke about, slide 16 shows our cash from operations annually since 2008. We have been generating significant cash and combined with our thoughtful approach to CapEx, this has allowed us to maximize free cash flow. So turning to an update on our capital allocation activity in the quarter, let's talk about a number of these items. As mentioned, we recently increased our dividend by 10% effective with the fourth quarter payout to $1.76 per share annually. This marks our fourth consecutive annual double digit increase since the fall of 2012. And as I mentioned, we strengthened our policy to move the target payout range up to 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Share buyback remains an important part of our capital allocation strategy. We bought 151 million of shares in the third quarter which has brought our year-to-date total to 423 million shares and our total since September of 2013 to almost 1.9 billion shares. Moving onto the next item, as we have previously disclosed, we needed to take action this year regarding the loan agreements associated with IP's sale of the of timberlands back in 2006. Our objective was to reduce IP's risk and preserve financial flexibility while maintaining the deferral of $1.4 billion in taxes. We took a series of successful actions during the third quarter to achieve those objectives. I think it's important to first remind everyone on the context around this and then walk you through in a bit more detail than I might normally do, the details of what we accomplished in the third quarter and what we plan to do in the fourth quarter. As you know, we sold some of our timberlands in 2006 for $4.85 billion in an installment sale which resulted in a deferral of $1.4 billion in taxes on the proceeds from that sale. The 2006 structure was up for extension renewal later this year and into 2016. So we thoroughly evaluated not only an extension of the structure but also restructuring options that would reduce IP's exposure to bank risk while continuing to maintain the $1.4 billion tax deferral. Ultimately we moved forward in the third quarter with a restructuring which provides IP with benefits and flexibility going forward. Third quarter restructuring will be followed in the fourth quarter with a five-year extension of the new structure. The original structure was full recourse meaning that we pledged not one the timber notes but also $4.85 billion in IP debt obligation as collateral for the bank loan. A lot has changed since we put the original structure in place making this type of structure no longer the most prudent for International Paper. So we made the decision to move to a limited recourse structure. The first step in this process was to buy out our third party equity investor for $198 million. That investor was necessary in the original structure but was no longer needed in the new structure. Additionally, moving to the new structure allowed us to eliminate $150 million of debt from our balance sheet. The most significant requirement in the move from full recourse to limited recourse was to adequately collateralize the $4.85 billion of bank loan. To accomplish that, we made a $630 million payment against those loans which comes back to IP when we receive the cash from the timber notes. As a result of moving to limited recourse, the assets and liabilities associated with the structure have come onto our balance sheet in the third quarter which is similar to the treatment we have with the Temple-Inland timber monetization. In the fourth quarter, we will work to put permanent financing in place for the five year extension and following the five year extension, the monetization structure can be extended up to an additional 15 years. So to summarize, a tremendous amount of work was accomplished in the quarter. We set the stage for completion of the five year extension of the timber monetization which really allows us to keep the option up to an additional 15 years. The new structure eliminates IP's exposure to significant risk and it maintains the $1.4 billion tax deferral. So going back to the slide and moving on to capital spending, we have set the 2016 plan at $1.4 billion which will include spending related to the projects we announced last quarter for the North American Industrial Packaging system as well as the Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion project. And finally, as you know on October 8, we announced our decision to sell our stake in the Sun JV to our partner for $23 million. And importantly, the deal also includes the removal of roughly $400 million of JV debt off of IP's consolidated balance sheet. As Mark mentioned earlier, we've made a lot of progress towards the close and expect to finalize everything shortly. And so with that, let me turn it back over to you, Mark. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carol, for taking us through all those details on the very important elements of capital allocation. I feel good about our capital allocation strategy and the work we accomplished in the third quarter. It was a busier than normal quarter on that front. These are the right moves for IP, and I'm really confident about our path ahead. What I would like to do, though, on slide 18, is put a little more context around our strategic decision relative to Asia and what we see as a continued important market for IP. And you've heard me say this before. We've been looking at China for a while. We serve it many different ways, and we reached a conclusion that serving Asia in all of those ways that we have in the past is really no longer the best strategy to maximize value for IP. So we decided to exit the on-the-ground manufacturing we do in China for Coated Paperboard as well as our Industrial Packaging Box business. That's both in China and Southeast Asia, the Box businesses. We'll continue to serve customers though, in this really important region, in a variety of ways \u2013 in ways that are working very well today, including exports from our Ilim joint venture for softwood pulp and select exports from the U.S. of globally competitive products like our Kraft linerboard and our fluff pulp. So China and Asia remain important to us. We're willing to re-evaluate how we serve the markets as we go through time, and that's what we did in this case. This is a significant decision for the company and one that makes IP even stronger and more valuable. So on the last slide before we go to Q&A, on slide 19, in closing I'd like to turn to the investment pieces for International Paper. We've built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key select markets where International Paper has a right to win. If we execute well, we have a right to win. I like our portfolio and we'll continue to look for opportunities to refine it and improve the company as we move forward. Our strategy is enabling us to achieve an increased return on invested capital above our cost of capital, and we've been doing this for the last five years, so we're really convinced that we can sustainably continue to generate these type of returns and continue to improve the company. We're also generating \u2013 and Carol mentioned this \u2013 it's really critical that we focus on the cash flow element of our company so that we can fund our capital allocation strategy. And again, we're proving that we can generate strong, sustainable free cash flow year in and year out across the company. And finally, we're focused on thoughtful capital allocation, which we just had a detailed view of on Carol's last slide that's based on the principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper a better company that you can count on for the long term. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and we'll open up the floor for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. Again, please limit your questions to one and a follow-up. Your first question is from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and thanks for the color and all the components here. Just one \u2013 kind of taking a step back, Mark. I mean over the last say 12 months or so you've done a number of actions mostly deletes or cleaning up elements of the portfolio. As you sit today, do you feel that you're largely done with what you want to do with the portfolio? Are there components in the business that look particularly attractive to you that you feel that you'd want to be adding or looking at? So with respect to how are you thinking about acquisitions or the portfolio as a whole as it sits today. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Chris, that's a great question and some of what you do naturally over time is what we've been talking about in the last year, which is refining the portfolio, recognizing that sometimes everything we're trying to do isn't working the way we thought it would be and that'd be a continued element of how we look at the company. But I would remind you, though, that we have not just taken some things out, we've also reinvested in a pretty big way and it's paying dividends into our Industrial Packaging business. It doesn't get the same press as an acquisition but making that business even stronger through improving our operations on the box side as well as the mill side has had a pretty good effect and we've got more to do there. And I mentioned in my comments, I like the portfolio but by no means does that mean there won't be any more changes. The changes will come against our filter of can we make the company stronger and create more value and generate more cash that we can then fund our capital allocation strategy through. So on M&A, I've said this before, M&A is obviously a part of your strategy in any company but again, against our filter of creating value and doing things that increase the return on invested capital with a good spread above our cost of capital would be the first place we'd start. And obviously the industrial logic of what we do and do well has to fit as well. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And as a follow-up, if I could. As I look at \u2013 you've got a slide here where you highlight downtime that you've taken across most of your mills and such, when we think about downtime in North America with significant amount of \u2013 there's been some chunks of new capacity come on-stream, there have been even more chunks of capacity that have come out. How do you think about the market as it sits today? Is it relatively balanced to you? Do you feel that \u2013 as I look over the past three years, you've taken downtime I think in all but one of the quarters, do you feel that you're kind of about done needing to take downtime or perhaps de-evaluate, maybe taking a little capacity out yourselves? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, Chris, that's a great question and this is a statement across all of our businesses. We run the operations based on our order book and our capacity given outages and all of those things doesn't perfectly match our demand. Demand seasonality and capacity seasonality are somewhat out of phase in our business, we've limited that over time. The Containerboard business has gotten really good at it because we have so many mills but we're going to make the product and all of those businesses that we have orders for and that we need, that's what yields the amount of downtime we take. What we've learned to do, though, is take that downtime on a marginal cost basis and do it pretty efficiently. We are no longer practicing paper making from yesterday where the only way you make money is if you run everything wide open to its engineering limit. We've now improved our system enough where we can run our business at our manufacturing facilities to the market demand we have and be profitable doing it. And we continue to work to get better at that because that's a real important element of having the kind of company that we tried to create; flexibility and the ability to match the orders we have any quarter, any month or any year. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. And maybe following up a little bit on that, in terms of the outlook you gave guidance indications on the impacts from volume, I think impacting you talked about like $35 million for volume and you talked about the operations in paper and packaging, input costs, mill maintenance, et cetera. I think it summed up something like $135 million, $140 million which would suggest in the low $0.20. First of all, would that be about right in terms of the impacts from those elements? And other than the Ilim coming the other way, would there be anything else significant? And related to that, does that capture the expectations of the seasonal type of downtime that you might take which you were just referring to? And if you could help us out there. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Mark, this is Carol. I think for sure what we were attempting to do was to kind of highlight that seasonality because that's a lot of what you're seeing there. It's about the days, it's about the time of year, it's about the order patterns that we see. And since the third quarter is a strong quarter traditionally and the fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally weaker quarter and that's \u2013 I think you've captured it. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then just another \u2013 one quick follow-up on the Uncoated Freesheet business, now we've seen the countervailing duties in place for a little while. What if any implications has that been having for the North American market and then I guess in your case too what you do in Brazil? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Mark. This is Mike Amick. Just real quickly on that, I mean it's still rather fluid in terms of the market as we see changes in the dynamics that are happening with regard to imports and as they take effect. They're still preliminary, final duties will come in in February. As you saw from the stats, some of these are still estimates. We saw a decrease year-over-year in the third quarter by roughly 80,000 tons. The overall market right now we think is kind of year-to-date is roughly down about 1% to 1.5%. And so I think this is going to still be somewhat of a moving \u2013 and fluid over the course over the next several quarters. With respect to Brazil and the volume there, we weren't moving a lot of product into this market from Brazil. What was coming into warehouses, say in Miami, was going out into other parts of Latin America. So from a Brazil standpoint in the U.S. that was really not a big impact. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. And so it is fair to say because that 1%, 1.5% that's certainly better than what we have been seeing. So does the net effect at this point seem to be favorable at least near-term on the market? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Yeah. Mark, I mean I think that's a fair statement. Certainly where we've been seeing kind of the 3% to 4% decline, this has been an improvement that we've seen. And as far as International Paper goes, we've done a little bit better than that. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, maybe going back to just Containerboard supply and demand in the U.S., can you talk about how you're seeing demand thus far in the quarter? How you're thinking about your inventory position relative to where you need it to be and just what you're seeing in export markets? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. Good morning. This is Tim Nicholls. Actually demand starting in the fourth quarter is reasonably good and I think you have to remember we're up against a pretty tough comp given how well the market performed last year. The market was building in August/September but then continuing to the fourth quarter. So I think any positive growth, I mean any positive growth this year in the fourth quarter has to be viewed as a big plus. And in October we're trending positive. So right now we're up about 1% but I think we're encouraged so far. In terms of inventory, we grew our inventories from second quarter to third quarter and they're roughly where we wanted them. We did that for two reasons, one, we've talked about before, supply chain efficiencies and the return on carrying a little bit more inventory more than pays for itself. But also as we came out of the second quarter, we were just coming out of heavy outage and so we had depleted inventories, built them back in the third quarter to get ready for fourth quarter outage season. So I think we're in a good place in terms of our inventories. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, Tim. And just a last one from me, thinking about the capital allocation. So a couple of things that you said. One was the investment-grade balance sheet, and two, was the deal, most importantly has to drive return on invested capital above the cost of capital. So on the investment-grade, what's sort of the upper limit around leverage as you see it? And the return above invested capital, does that mean in the first year or do you feel like as long as you can get to that number by year two, three, or four, you'd still be willing to look at an acquisition that's transformative? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Alex, I'll take the second part and I'll ask Carol to comment on our debt metrics. I think on the investments, significant investments we need to see line-of-sight to an ROIC that bats the cost of capital pretty quickly in those first \u2013 like you said first two or three years. And then we need to believe we have actionable plans to get it to a spread of maybe 200 basis points above our cost and it doesn't need to be a forever task. And you've seen us do that on our big acquisitions, Weyerhaeuser and Temple, for example, and we're not going to be perfect. But that's really what we're looking at and that's a filter that we are all aligned on and so we see it pretty quickly. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Alex, regarding the investment-grade. In our space, three times debt to EBITDA for us feels comfortable. One of the strengths of International Paper that you have to remember is because our businesses are so well positioned in the markets and their cost position, our cash flow generation pretty much throughout most conditions remains very strong. And so we feel comfortable keeping that type of leverage and as do the rating agencies. And the reputation we have with the rating agencies which we do what we say we're going to do, and that's been working well for us. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Excellent. Thank you, Mark and Carol. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Thanks, and good morning. Just a quick question about the change in the timber transaction from 10 years ago. It's on the balance sheet as a current item, I guess that's because you're going through this transition and I don't think it was there before. Will that be removed from the balance sheet? Since it's non-recourse or will we continue to see the offsetting entries on the asset and liability side as long-term going forward? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. It's in the current because we're in the process of putting the permanent financing in place in the fourth quarter. So we'll put the permanent financing in place in the fourth quarter and it'll move out of current. And then it'll be treated just like the Temple-Inland timber monetization is but you will see it on the balance sheet, Chip. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Got you. And then second question is on the capital spending. It seemed like after the last call in late July, early August that CapEx for next year was looking to be above the depreciation rate, maybe $1.6 billion because of the $300 million program in Industrial Packaging and how that was an overt, above and beyond investment that you were using with free cash flow given the returns. So now it looks like you're guiding down the CapEx for next year from what we would have thought. I know you didn't have an official number at the last call. And I was wondering what items or how you were able to make those changes and what the thought was behind that decline. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I'm going to just take a shot at this and then obviously let Mark comment. But I think what happened in July is we just were not in our process yet to declare what our 2016 plan was but we felt important to communicate to our investors our plans around the business. And so what we talked about in July was the project and agreed that we left it open that there could be a change to the 2016 capital. But obviously we do our planning work as we enter this time of year getting ready for 2016 and we just feel comfortable that we can get the work done that we need to get done on the projects and in the company with the $1.4 billion. So I don't think it's any more complicated than that, Chip. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And does that include anymore Boiler MACT or did that drop off? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It includes what's in there so that includes our regulatory required spending. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. And last quick question is on \u2013 you talked about China and how obviously it's an important market but certainly serving them in the fluff market from the States and in the softwood pulp market and I guess virgin linerboard from Russia, certainly for a lot of reasons makes sense given the fiber situation. Could you make the same argument or would you about India? Or are there differences about India than what you see in China? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Chip, I think you could make arguments that obviously there are different economic barriers at any moment in time, whether it's tariffs, the supply chain maturity and all of those things that would allow you to make money serving a market with imported products. I mean the fundamental element is what you just said and that is if you have globally competitive products from a quality standpoint, which we have and a globally competitive cost position and in our business it starts with fiber, that if you can access a market that appreciates your product you should be able to make that work. And you can see examples of that in the forest product industry all over the world. So that's something we always look at and it goes back to our multichannel strategy in our Containerboard business. We are containerboard providers for the world markets, not just the U.S. market and we've been doing that for a long time because the product's good and our cost position is good and our service platform is trusted by the customer. So it's definitely a possibility. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman, UBS. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Going back to the capital program in Industrial Packaging, is there any further guidance in terms of how that's going to roll out over the next year or two in terms of both the spending and the kind of incremental capacity that may come with it? Is that in the same timeline that you would have thought last quarter or has that been refined? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hi, Gail. It's Tim. Yes. It's in line, no changes to how we were thinking. As you'll remember we talked about this being spending that we would begin in 2016 and it would roll into 2017 and no change to anything, the spending or the timeline. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Just a reminder, Gail, on when Tim covered those projects last quarter he talked about the drivers of those projects including the Industrial Packaging containerboard manufacturing system. There's a lot of elements, quality improvement, cost reduction, and if we need it, a volume component. And of course we'll make the volume and consume the volume in our own box plants and in our open market channels if the demand is there. If it's not there, those are still really good projects from the first two elements of cost and quality. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And back last fall when you announced the plans to restart Valliant you talked about also bringing Newport out of medium and more into facing paper. And I'm just wondering, can you give an update on where you stand on that? Have you accomplished it or is that yet to come? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : We haven't accomplished it fully, we continue to grow our gypsum product there and so we're encouraged by the growth that we see and the contractual obligations that we have going forward. So it's in process and we'll continue to work on it. We're trying to do all of this in a very methodical way and eliminate or minimize disruption. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. One for Tim. Tim you talked about the October pickup in U.S. box demand that you're seeing up about 1%. Given that industry box demand growth has slowed throughout the course of the year and given the obvious pockets of weakness evident in the U.S. economy, are you surprised that your shipments are up 1% in October? And do you expect that type of growth to continue? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Well, it's hard to predict the future in terms of what will happen. As I said, fourth quarter is a tough comp. We had some exposures earlier in the year just based on our segment mix in terms of processed foods and how they have underperformed for a period of time now. Another one that underperformed in the first part of the year, well really right through the third quarter, has been protein, Avian flu in poultry and there was a ban on certain countries allowing imported poultry products. Those bans have been lifted. We're actually now seeing a bit of recovery. We hope that will continue through the fourth quarter. So yes, there's the economy and you read about manufacturing. I think what's maybe hurting us a little bit earlier in the year potentially is now helping us. But one bright spot, we saw our beverage sales pick up in the third quarter, which was a little bit of a reversal of a trend. And so I think that is a helpful and a hopeful sign. The other thing, we have a fairly large exposure to e-commerce, and indication so far is that it looks like it has potential for a really big season in the fourth quarter. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And one for Mark. Mark, your EBITDA is down about 4% to 5% year to date, and I fully appreciate that emerging markets have been worse than many folks expected. Do you have reason to think next year will be notably different than this year in terms of the year-over-year changes in EBITDA? And if so, can you give any sense as to why? Thanks very much. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Adam. I think we obviously intended to improve our EBITDA this year for the reasons you mentioned. We've had some improvements, but we've given it back because of some of the headwinds. We're evaluating our outlook for next year, but we feel good about the level of performance that we have as a company, and we believe we can sustain that level of performance. The global economy is going to really provide an opportunity to improve or stay the same, and we're still evaluating that right now. But we feel good about the level that we're at. And our goal is obviously to continue to grow the earnings of the company. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Mark. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Our next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. Can you provide some color on the weakness you called out in North America consumer? Is the pricing slippage pretty much isolated to the plate stock business? And has the downtime you've taken during the quarter pretty much tightened up the market at this point? W. Michael Amick - SVP-Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Phil. This is Mike, Mike Amick. What we've seen in the third quarter, as Carol mentioned in her comments, we do think that there is some sluggish demand out there. Most of that is really wrapped around some destocking through the supply chain. We've seen some \u2013 at our converters a fair amount of 3% to 4% kind of pulldown in stock, that coupled with some already elevated inventories across the industry, we think is explaining a lot of that. Our volume, we've had a couple of specific accounts around our backlogs as well as some measured decisions that we took as far back as a year-and-a-half ago to start focusing and pulling back on some of our export business. And as Mark said, we're going to continue in this business and all businesses to manage to our order book. So fourth quarter in this business tends to be a little seasonally challenged as we know. And I will say on our food service side in the cup stock business, in the managing through that portion of our business is very strong. We've seen some \u2013 having a great year with our shipments up about 6% year-to-date and we've got strong order books in that business. We just completed the kit and footprint expansion. Those new machines and cup converting machines are being deployed now and we're actually operating that new equipment. So we're excited about that portion of our business. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess switching gears back to Containerboard, I mean there's been a lot of questions on the call about supply/demand, more short-term nature but medium to longer-term I think, Mark, you've always kind of characterized the market as being balanced. But based on some of the capacity that's coming on and one of your big competitors adding a fair amount of capacity in the fourth quarter at least, what's your view on supply/demand going forward? And just wanted to get some thoughts on the export market, you've seen some weakness there on pricing, it does seem like a lot of your competitors are pulling back in that market. Do you have a sense if prices are going to start stabilizing here or is there still some downside risk? Thanks. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. Just on the capacity question, I'm not going to comment on what competitors do with their capacity. So we have up to this point with capacity additions been able to manage our way through the whole process with our customers and I think we're offering a different value proposition than a lot of the capacity that started up over the past two years. We have good geographic coverage, we have wide product mix and we have tremendous capability across our whole system that allows us to sell to customers providing quality service and product range. On exports, it's been a little bit softer here in late summer as we entered the third quarter, not much. And I think the surprising thing is with the strength of the dollar, virgin Kraft linerboard exports, the markets we sell to, it's held up reasonably well for the year, which says to us, it's a little bit of a question mark, but it says to us there's a need for the product that they're buying as opposed to just general economic conditions for all packaging in the region. So there's a little bit of softness around price, not much, and hopefully it will stabilize through the fourth quarter. But I think the markets have held up reasonably well this year. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Tim, are mill nets pretty much at a point where a decision has to be made whether or not your high cost capacity makes sense to run and kind of support that export market? I'm just trying to get a better sense if there's \u2013 we're at a point where export prices stabilize this year? Thanks. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : We still like our margins on exports. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Phil, another part of your question was around pricing and was that isolated to the plate stock. It primarily is. We're seeing some softness in the folding side, but most of that is isolated to the plate stock business. Operator : And your next question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and taking my questions. Carol, I wanted to come back to the Timber transaction. I just want to make sure that I had a good sort of holistic on it. So you're going to be making a payment of roughly $600 million. Has that already occurred or will that be occurring in the fourth quarter? Where will we see it? I'm assuming we'll see it in the balance sheet in debt. And for making that payment you defer the tax, which is I think \u2013 you defer payment on the tax for $1.4 billion for as much as five years and perhaps as much as 15 years, would that be fair? And what else have I left out or mischaracterized? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So to take the first question, yes. The cash went into the structure last quarter. So that's done. And what you'll see on the balance sheet, George, is going to be simply \u2013 you'll actually see the cash go away from the cash line, and then you'll see on the assets side, you'll see the assets from the special purpose entity, and then down in the liability side, you'll see the other side of the equation, the non-recourse financial liability of it. So that's what you'll see on the balance sheet. So you'll see $4.85 billion up in assets, and then you'll see the $4.2 billion down in the liability line. And the delta is the cash that we put into the deal, essentially. That's the simple way to think about it. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And in turn, you'll defer the taxes for at least another five years, perhaps as much as 15 years. Is that correct? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. If you go back to the structure, the structure was for 30 years total. So we did the first 10 years. And the way the original deal was structured it was 10 years with four five-year extensions, which got you to the total of 30 years. So this first one is for the first five years, and then that gives us the option at the end of this five years for three more five years or another 15 years. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. That's clear. As I mentioned earlier, we appreciate the details, particularly like slide nine and slide 15 on the capital allocation. My other question, a lot of them have already been asked, as you look at supply/demand again in paperboard broadly, and realizing that you're going to run your system as always to demand, some of your competitors, one of your larger ones in South America, has talked about ramping up their own boxboard production. And then in Europe one of your larger global peers, if you will, has talked about bringing on one of their large conversion projects a little bit earlier than expected. None of this is really new news, but has that changed at all your outlook in terms of being able to supply the market? Or are you seeing a bit more competition in these markets as a result? Thanks, guys. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : George, that's a great question. The paperboard market does have a global element to it depending on the type of product, and we've been managing these shifts and changes in the different geographies and the type of product used. You know we make SPS in the U.S., but we make folding boxboard in Europe, and we obviously take all of that into our thought process around how we're going to make \u2013 what we're going to make and where we're going to make it. As Mike mentioned, a portion of our value proposition is that we provide products really on the high end of the paperboard product spectrum to really, really good converting customers. And then on the cup side, we are one of those really, really good converters that provide the final product. And so I wouldn't say that any of those announcements or changes or intentions that you mentioned create an immediate reaction into IP's plans, but we consider them. But our position in this market we feel pretty good about in terms of the customers we have, the converting we do ourselves, and the competitiveness that we have both on a cost and product side. So we'll keep watching the market that we play in, but that's kind of how we look at it. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Mark, the Varkhaus project also then hasn't changed your outlook at this juncture? That was part of my oblique reference there before. Again, thanks. Good luck in the quarter. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, George. Operator : Our next question is from Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about Brazil. Your guidance on slide 14, it's always interesting when you see Brazil listed as stable in Packaging kind of across the board. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on one, do you think there's opportunity for pricing to be a benefit just given that you've seen some announcements out there for the fourth quarter? And then two, just operationally should we be looking for more improvement either in the fourth quarter into 2016? Because I think you've mentioned in the past that you'd like to take out some cost in that operation. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Debbie, that's a good question. The Brazil Packaging business, Carol highlighted the Paper business and the business model in Paper is different. We export about half of what we make so we have a different profit model. The Box business is all about the Brazil economy and the negative 2.5% GDP is a negative 2.5% box demand and that is the challenge. The demand is soft, inflation is up and we've struggled to recover that with pricing. We're starting to see some price movement but I think the first time you try to really get something in is the hardest in an inflation environment that has a demand decline. So our view on that business right now is we're realigning our manufacturing assets and taking out the cost we talked about and we're repositioning ourselves for the best place we can participate commercially. So there's been some customer turnover, we were doing some things we probably weren't the best suited to do. We're replacing some of that business with business we're more competitive on. It's going to be a work-in-process. Be great when we get Brazil back to a plus 2% or 3% versus a minus 2.5% because it'll definitely help with the business performance. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on pension expenses. Are you able to comment at all just kind of looking at 2016 based on how your assets have performed and rates, if we should see an incremental pension expense in 2016? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Debbie, we don't anticipate a required pension contribution in 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Management. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Carol. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have a question and a follow-on. And the question really is on the EBITDA targets that you've set out in the past at Investor Days, both in terms of the level and in growth rate, and do we need to rethink those? And if so, how are you thinking about them? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well those targets we've talked a lot about. The company's quite a bit different than it was when we set the target back in 2012. So I think the intent is to maximize the EBITDA potential of the company that we have and obviously growing EBITDA is a part of creating value over the long term. So that will stay in our targets and goals. We aren't prepared to throw another target out there at this moment in time, but rest assured, part of what we talked about doing was creating value over time. It had an EBITDA number, it had a margin number and it had a return number. We're hitting on some of those, but we've obviously been short on the EBITDA line. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And, Mark, if I could as just a follow-up, your comments around China and what you were kind of hinting at in terms of potentially India about being a fiber exporter rather than being a manufacturer in the country, over time exporting kind of pulp and container board has been one of the most volatile segments of the business. So can you just kind of help us weigh that element of your strategy with the volatility that historically has come with it? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : I think the serving of markets that have a growth profile but may not have a raw material or natural resource advantage is never going to be the primary business of International Paper, and it's probably not the primary business of most forest products companies. But it is a very good way to use fully your assets, turn those assets at the highest level, and generate tremendous cash. And the volatility is something I think you can manage when the base of your business, as is the case of most forest products, you make it and use it in the same region. So this isn't a shift to being a global exporter of everything. This is just saying we have the best chance to serve these markets with the lowest cost, highest quality products, and they need the products. So there's a win for our company, and there's a win for the local producers who may just want the resource to do the conversion themselves. So that's kind of how we look at it. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Mark. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Just circling back to North American Containerboard, you have a slide that shows you closing the volume gap with the industry, but it seems like the erosion in box prices or price mix that you saw in 3Q stepped up a bit from 2Q. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the competitive market conditions you're seeing in North American box markets And maybe reconcile the expectation for flat pricing in 4Q with what seems like maybe a tougher box price, tougher box market, if that's accurate? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior VP-Printing & Communications Papers : Hey, Anthony. It's Tim. The box market is always competitive. But having said that, the price mix, there was more mix in the numbers than there was price given \u2013 we have huge swings from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter sometimes based on seasonality. And so I think the market feels pretty stable to us. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just circling back to China and potentially serving China from Russia. I'm guessing adding Kraft line or capacity at Ilim will be pretty attractive given where the ruble is. But on the other hand, obviously the risks of doing business in Russia seem pretty elevated right now. Mark, I was wondering if you could just contrast those two things in terms of future investments in Ilim, especially on the Kraft liner side versus the geopolitical risks in Russia. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Anthony, that's a great question. On the first part, we're not potentially supplying China from Ilim and it is a big part of what's happening today and has been happening very successfully. And of course it's back to what I said earlier, there's a raw material renewable natural resource advantage and a high quality, low cost manufacturing operation that's located adjacent to a needing and growing market. We do make some containerboard in Ilim today and it's obviously one of the best places in the world given the softwood profile to make Kraft liner and Ilim is a publicly traded company. We have a 50% position in it, they have a strategic plan, they're working that. Right now our focus at Ilim is to operate the first phase of what we've done with the market pulp operations at Bratsk and the improvements we've made in the Western Russian operations to serve the Russian market and we're doing quite well on that. On the geopolitical things, I was there last week, our view on some of these things is a very long-term view and political issues come and go. And we have very good partners, we have a very good access to the people we need to in the government and we feel like our business is sustainable over the long term. We are obviously mindful of the issues that are going on and we hope to work through those and hopefully the business environment transcends the political environment which it has in many cases in many parts of the world over time. Operator : Our final question today comes from Steve Chercover from D. A. Davidson. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning. The pressure's on. So the first question, I've noticed over the last five years your distribution expenses as a percent of sales have gone from 5.2% in 2010 to 6.4% last year. Is there anything you can do to stop this steady progression? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm actually glad, Steve, you've pointed that out. It's something we've been talking about. It was a big reason for our supply chain investments we made, both on the people side and on the technology side over the last several years. I think we've mitigated what would have been a worse situation. We also changed the way we think about the full supply chain, including our inventory position in certain businesses. But we've got to use what we call in our company, ME \u2013 it's a set of tools that really are focused on lean manufacturing techniques that take waste and variability out and challenge what we're doing and how we deliver our product. Because I remember when I started working in this industry, it was a rounding error and today costs to get our products to market safely and reliably is at a level that it becomes a strategic issue to manage. So we've got a lot of really good people on it. We've invested in capability, and so we are making a difference. That 6% in many cases would have been completely out of control had we not intervened, but it's something we work on every day. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah. Thanks. $1.5 billion is not chump change. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Not at all. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: A couple for Carol, I suppose. The share purchase activity in the quarter, as I see it, seemed to be pretty much limited to the program and not much more. So I'm wondering whether the exit from the Sun joint venture precluded you from being more aggressive. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You know, Steve, as we said, our share buyback program will continue to be opportunistic, and it'll be a combination of how we're seeing the value as well as the cash available at a point in time. So there's no less focus or importance on that. As we go forward, just continue to watch our actions on that. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And final one. Just what prompted the increase in the dividend payout ratio? Clearly, we're happy. Does it reflect maybe a little bit less of an ambitious acquisition strategy? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Steve, our dividend payout policy really is based on our confidence of sustainable cash flow generation, and we do that with a trough test, where we look at conditions that reasonably could go wrong and are we comfortable at 40% to 50% of our cash flow, and does it stand the test of our internal trough testing. We adjusted our trough conditions based on new information about our businesses and how they're running, and what the competitive positions are. So that led us to feel like we can grow from 30% to 40% to 40% to 50%. It's really about that more than it is about what it says about other uses of cash or the other elements that Carol covered in our capital allocation. We feel real good about the cash generation potential of our company and that we should return a significant portion of that through a dividend to our shareholders, and we think we can do that at the 40% to 50% rate. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Terrific. Okay. Well happy holidays to everyone. We'll speak to you in 2016. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Well thanks all for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call for any additional questions you have, our phone numbers are on slide 20 of the presentation. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

Danny Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Melinda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President, Investor Relations, Jay Royalty. Please go ahead. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Melinda, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and 2015 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year call. I want to quickly go over the format we're going to use this morning. I will review the full year 2015 results first. And then I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss our fourth quarter results and the performances of our individual businesses, then come back and cover the outlook before we open it for Q&A. So I'm going to begin on slide five. International Paper finished a very solid year in 2015. We achieved a return on invested capital of 11%, well above our cost of capital. And this makes it the sixth consecutive year that our actual returns are above our cost of capital. Our free cash flow came in strong as well at $1.8 billion and our earnings per share of $3.65 was the highest EPS in 20 years. That was largely driven by strong results in our North American Industrial Packaging business and record level of results from our Ilim joint venture in Russia. Additionally, we completed the sale of our 55% stake in the Sun JV in China at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We received $25 million in cash in addition to eliminating approximately $400 million of consolidated debt from our balance sheet. We also made another meaningful increase to our dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter, and we enhanced our dividend policy, moving the target payout range to 40% to 50% of free cash flow, up from 30% to 40%. We feel confident in this change because it's based on a pressure test we did and updated, which provides a level of confidence to us that our businesses in different economic times have the ability to produce a very sustainable cash, and hence, a sustainable dividend. And finally, we continued our strong track record on share buyback as an additional means of returning cash to shareholders, buying more than 500 million shares in 2015. As of this call, total purchases since the inception of the buyback program in September of 2013 amount to about $2.1 billion. Moving to slide six and turning to the full year financial results, I'd like to highlight a couple of items on this slide. Year-over-year EPS, when adjusted for the non-cash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated debt, was up 5.5%. Revenue was down roughly 5% with the most significant factor being FX translation. And overall EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 17.6%. On slide seven, you can see that 2015 continued the trend of strong sustainable free cash flow, which has averaged $1.8 billion over the last several years. As we look into 2016 and beyond, we remain confident that IP has a portfolio that can continue to generate strong free cash flow results. We believe free cash flow generation and ROIC above the cost of capital are two key drivers of shareholder value. So we think we're on the right track. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to discuss the specifics of the fourth quarter. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm on slide eight. As Mark said earlier, EPS of $3.65 per share is the highest level in 20 years and compares favorably to $3 per share in 2014. Looking at the details, price and mix declines across the North American businesses were essentially offset by favorable input cost. Volume was generally flat across most businesses with the exception of reduced export volume from the North American containerboard business. Operations largely performed in line with expectations with cost reduction initiatives offsetting the majority of inflation for the year. Slightly higher taxes were more than offset by lower interest expense and a lower share count. And the Ilim JV posted significantly higher results due to improved operations, increased margins and a less negative FX impact on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Turning to the fourth quarter. Free cash flow was strong at $501 million. Industrial Packaging delivered another solid quarter based on steady daily box demand. Additional downtime was taken to balance our supply with our demand as the overall demand was impacted by three fewer shipping days as compared to the third quarter. Domestic prices were generally stable across our North American businesses, and volumes were seasonally higher along with increased prices in Brazil, Russia and Europe, primarily in our paper businesses. And finally, the Ilim JV turned in another strong quarter of results but was unfavorably impacted by a $0.05 non-cash FX charge on the JV's U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter bridge. As I mentioned, prices were generally stable across the businesses. Volume was unfavorably impacted by three less shipping days in the fourth quarter for the North American box business and we did have reduced export volume. This was partially offset by stronger volume in Europe and Brazil. Operations were negatively impacted by weather and flooding on the East Coast and were further impacted by higher operating costs in the quarter, including costs associated with the increased levels of maintenance and downtime taken to balance our supply with our demand. Quarterly earnings benefited from the favorable input costs and a lower non-cash FX charge at the Ilim JV. Turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging on slide 11. Volume, as I said, was impacted by three fewer shipping days in our U.S. box business and we did have lower export shipments. The daily shipment rate for boxes was up almost 4% over the third quarter and was flat year-over-year against a strong comp for IP. Operational costs were higher, significantly impacted by 322,000 tons of downtime, 230,000 tons of which was taken to balance our supply with our demand, and operating costs were also slightly higher in our Brazil and European Packaging businesses. Turning to slide 12, I want to provide some color on the North American box business and what we're experiencing in our shipments and the key segments we serve. As you can see, we experienced a 2% increase in year-over-year shipments on a per day basis from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014. And then in the fourth quarter of this year or last year, we essentially held that increased level of demand. I would say the market has even been a bit stronger than what we have experienced. From a key segment standpoint, we continue to be encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing. We continue to see substantial growth in the e-commerce and distribution segment in which we are a strong player. Another important trend is in the agricultural segment, which is benefiting from shifting consumer trends to more healthy foods. And new product offerings in the beverage segment are also driving some pockets of new growth. Overall, we see a healthy box market that will continue to benefit from evolving consumer trends. Moving to Consumer Packaging, the business experienced a less favorable mix and lower volume due to three less shipping days. The fourth quarter was a higher operating cost quarter, and the North American business experienced some transition cost associated with the shutdown of the Coated Paperboard machine at Riegelwood related to preparations for the conversion project. Outage expenses were higher as expected and input costs were favorable. Finally, earnings improved due to the sale of our share of the Sun JV. Turning to slide 14 in the paper business, IP experienced price increases in Brazil, Europe and Russia as well as the seasonally favorable mix improvement in Brazil that was partially offset by pulp price pressure in the quarter. Volume was higher primarily due to seasonal strength in Brazil and Europe. Operations were negatively impacted in North America due to extreme weather and flooding on the East Coast, some effects which will linger into the first quarter. Operating costs were seasonally higher as well. The negative FX swing here is simply the non-repeat of the favorable Brazilian FX impact that we experienced in the third quarter. Turning to slide 15, I want to provide an update on the Riegelwood Mill conversion project. As we announced last year, we are converting the mill to 100% pulp with the capability to run an additional 400,000 tons of softwood and/or fluff pulp. This will bring our total North American system to a capacity of 1.7 million tons, of which, 1.5 million tons can produce fluff pulp. The project is well underway, having shut down the first Coated Paperboard machine PM18, which is the one that's actually being converted, and we did that in December. And we've shut down the second machine PM15 in January. We will bring the converted machine back online in May, which means half the mill will be down for roughly half the year. Once online, we expect to fully ramp up on softwood pulp and qualify PM18 on fluff pulp by the end of the year. This will ensure we have adequate capacity for our key fluff customers as their demand grows. For the balance of the year, we expect to run and sell mostly market softwood pulp. We will incur costs associated with the conversion and the ramp up. In total, we expect the conversion impact in 2016 to impact earnings by roughly $75 million to $80 million with about $50 million impacting our first quarter earnings, and that's when the bulk of the conversion work will be done and much of the mill will be down, actually also for the annual outage. And then there'll be some ramp up costs beyond that, that will spread into the second and third quarters. Now turning to Ilim. The JV concluded a strong year of operational and financial results as the focus shifted to optimizing and leveraging the completed investments, and their very advantaged export positions. The JV achieved record operational EBITDA results of $724 million in 2015 and IP's corresponding equity earnings were $131 million. During the quarter, the JV refinanced a portion of their U.S. dollar debt to rubles. Relative to the first quarter outlook, the JV expects to continue its strong operational and cost performance against higher inflation, lower pulp prices and the expected weaker seasonality. Before I turn to the outlook for the first quarter, I want to just give a quick update on IP's balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, our balance sheet debt declined slightly to $9.3 billion. The pension gap declined by $300 million. In 2015, we made a $750 million voluntary contribution to the pension in the second quarter. Additionally, we had a bond issue and tender offer, which further reduced our debt towers in 2018 and 2021 at lower interest rates. And I'd also remind you that we increased our divided, as Mark said, 10% to $1.76 and bought back a little more than $500 million of stock in 2015. And currently, we're maintaining a cash balance of about $1 billion. So moving to the first quarter outlook on slide 18. Earnings associated with volume will be lower for the following reasons. Number one, channel mix in our North American Industrial Packaging business will impact earnings by $25 million as box volume will be seasonally weaker and export volume will be stronger. Secondly, our North American Consumer Packaging business will be impacted by roughly $5 million due to the exit of the Bristols, of the Carolina volume. And third, seasonally lower volume in Brazil will impact earnings by roughly $25 million. Pricing is expected to be lower for the North American pulp and paper businesses. These are expected to impact earnings by roughly $20 million. Price for our North American Industrial Packaging will be impacted by continued lower export pricing, along with the recent PPW index change. All in, this is expected to impact earnings by $20 million. Prices are expected to improve in both European, Russia and Brazil papers as recent price increase announcements are implemented. These will be somewhat offset by inflationary cost pressures in those regions. Operations are expected to be generally at the same level as the fourth quarter. Operational costs are expected to improve modestly in North American Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense will increase collectively by $56 million as shown on the slide, inclusive of the higher outage costs associated with the Riegelwood conversion as I mentioned earlier. And as always, we provide an outlook for Ilim, assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter. So the first quarter outlook assumes a non-repeat of the $0.05 charge we incurred in the fourth quarter. So, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Carol. Before I would turn to 2016, I just like to reiterate that I feel really good about our results in 2015. I'm on slide 19 right now. The year didn't play out the way we envisioned coming into it, but given how things unfolded across the globe, I think we played our hand pretty well and had a number of significant accomplishments in 2015. I'm really proud of the way our team stepped up and dealt with the environment that we were really dealing with, not the one we thought we were going to be dealing with. Turning now to 2016. Sitting here today, it's real difficult to predict where things might go from a global macro standpoint. We feel good about how we're positioned to deal with whatever the market brings and the agility that we have in IP to adjust as needed. As you can see from the chart, CapEx for 2016 is $1.3 billion. This will ensure we get the most important things done and it reinforces our commitment to remain highly focused on maximizing free cash flow. As we highlighted earlier on this call, IP has delivered consistently strong results and return on invested capital and free cash flow for the last several years. And I have every confidence we'll do so again in 2015. Turning to slide 20. Beyond keeping our employee safe and being a good steward to the environment and being good citizens in the communities in which we operate, we have a robust list of focus items for 2016. At the top of that list and for very good reason is continuing to improve our North American Industrial Packaging system. We have a great foundation to build upon, but we certainly have many opportunities to optimize further across all aspects of the business. The Riegelwood conversion has begun with the objective of having the mill up and running in May and fully ramped up by the fourth quarter. Our teams are keenly focused on making this happen safely and on time and getting the new machine qualified in quick order to supply fluff pulp. Additionally, we are executing our plan to grow our cup business at our recently expanded Canton, Ohio cup facility. This will enable us to take care of our key customers' growing needs in this important segment as consumers drive the shift \u2013 continue to drive the shift from foam to fiber-based packaging. Another focus item for us in 2016 is to optimize our North American paper portfolio by aligning with the most attractive customers and the opportunities to deliver a strong value proposition to those customers. We're also working toward the sale of our Asia box business as we announced last October. And the Ilim JV had a strong year in 2015 and we expect another strong performance in 2016. And finally, we remain focused on maximizing free cash flow generation and deploying that capital in a way that creates additional value for our shareholders. All of this positions International Paper to have another successful year in 2016. And as I wrap up, in closing, before we go to Q&A, I go back to the investment thesis for International Paper. We built a portfolio with strong competitive positions in key markets where IP has a right to win. I like our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the company as we move forward. Our strategy is enabling us to achieve and increase the spread of our return on invested capital above our cost of capital. And we've been doing this for the last six years. In addition to that, we've proven that we can generate strong sustainable free cash flow year in and year out and we've been doing that for several years now. We remain highly focused on a capital allocation strategy that's based on some very simple principles of creating value, rewarding our shareholders and making International Paper better. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and open the floor for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. I first wanted to understand on the downtime or \u2013 sorry, the maintenance outage expense, it was a good bit higher in 2016 now than what it had been in 2015. Is that primarily the Riegelwood or are there other things going on? Kind of connected to that, I just wanted to clarify, because it didn't seem like the Consumer Packaging had a lot higher maintenance expense. It seemed like it was Printing Papers and Industrial Packaging. And maybe if you could just clarify all that, that'd be helpful. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Mark, this is Carol. I'm going to start and then I'm going to turn it over to Tim. So you've got two things happening. One is Riegelwood is now going to be classified in the paper business because it's North American paper and pulp. So that's why you don't see the impact in consumer. And so the increase you see on the paper side in the appendix is around Riegelwood. And then I'm going to let Tim comment on the Industrial Packaging piece. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Thanks, Carol. Good morning, Mark. Most of it is just additional \u2013 it's the nature of the projects that we have in the mills. From year-to-year, we get variation, and depending on what comes up in the cycle for maintenance in one year can be different from the next. And so, in five of our larger mills, we have more expensive items to deal with in 2016 than we did in 2015. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. And then \u2013 and if I could real quickly, could you update us on how business in Industrial Packaging has been looking through January? And also maybe a little bit more color on the e-commerce side of things. What percentage of your Industrial Packaging is e-commerce now and what type of growth have you been seeing? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Yeah. While the growth is good, it's a relatively small segment in terms of the total business. But it's a rapidly growing segment. So we had a strong fourth quarter, especially in December around e-commerce that continued into the first part of January. As you know, if you've ordered something online, you get a box when you receive it. And then if you have to return it, you use another box to send it back and swap it out. So it carried over a little bit into January. Our January was, I'd say more or less the way we expected it. We did have a little bit of impact from weather with the snowstorms that moved through. And if you remember, January last year was a bit of an anomalous month with January 2, the way it fell right before a weekend and was it a workday, wasn't it a workday. So it's a pretty strong comp with some confused workdays for January. But as we look through all of that, January was expected and first quarter looks to be more or less as we expect. We're expecting that we'll be flat on an absolute basis in the first quarter. But we do model our \u2013 the market demand growth, what we're anticipating. And things could change, but the model right now says that it could be as much as 1% in the first quarter. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. First question is on the pension situation. I know you all made a big payment last year and you made some headway at least as of year end with the net pension balance. But how should we think about whether the contributions may or may not be, let's say in the next three years? If you could give us some view on that. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure, Chip. This is Carol. So, yeah, the pension gap was reduced by $300 million. We did make the contribution. Of course, we had other moving parts, which is the rate change was helpful. There was some actuarial changes on some demographic data that was unhelpful. And as we all know, asset performance the way we're invested wasn't a particularly stellar year last year. So, all in, we saw the benefit of $300 million. As it relates to required contribution, we have no required contribution for 2016 or 2017. And then when you get out to 2018, it's going to be all around our asset performance over the next two years and then where interest rate goes and if there's any more policy changing. So that would be how to think about it. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And so at this point, there's no plans to make any kind of voluntary payments this year or next year? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : At this point, I wouldn't speculate on that. Things could always change depending upon what may happen. But at this point, I would say that we don't anticipate any contribution. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then as we look at CapEx, I might be mistaken but I think you just kind of come down twice. I know that you announced the containerboard system initiative back in July and we kind of added that and then I think in October, I believe you sort of gave us a view of about $1.4 billion, now it's down to $1.3 billion. And my question is what should we expect it to be in sort of on an ongoing basis 2017, 2018? Is \u2013 in other words, with the containerboard initiative, I would think unless there's something similar to back that up a bit beyond that, you could even see it maybe slip further in the future? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Chip, good morning. This is Mark. I think you said it correctly. When we announced these containerboard projects, we didn't say we were raising capital. I think the assumption in the marketplace that we were. So I don't view it coming down twice. We said $1.4 billion was probably the preliminary scope we had in the fourth quarter. We refined that in looking at the actual year and the projects and our capital allocation policy. And so we come in at $1.3 billion. And I think we've said before with the asset base that we have and the culture we have in our company to operate safe environmentally sound and reliable operations, we tend to have a base load in that $1 billion range. And then above that, it's to hopefully improve the company, be it cost reduction, strategic investments, for example, like our cup project at Kenton. And that's got some flexibility in it over time, again, against the backdrop of our capital allocation principles. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then last question, you certainly gave a nice boost to the dividend late last year, how do you view I guess buybacks versus other possible uses beyond the dividend, of course, in light of where the stock price might be, especially given the decline we've seen in the last six months? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's a good question, Chip. I think, we use the word, balanced use of cash and then finding the right ways to return cash to investors. We like what we've done with the dividend and that 40% to 50% target area. We plan on maintaining. And the share buybacks will continue to be opportunistic. And hopefully, we do a really good job of buying as much as we can at the right value, below the intrinsic value of the company. And we'll continue to do that. We've still got $900 million left on the authorization. So we've got more that we can do and we plan on doing it. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Last year, in the fourth quarter, you provided some outlook for the full year, can you kind of provide some guidance whether it's free cash flow or EBITDA for 2016, or just wider trends? That'd be helpful. Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So this is Carol. Again, what I would say is, as we all know, we're living in a very uncertain outlook for the world. And so it's very difficult to pin it down on any one metric. But I think what you can see is the things that we feel very confident about is our underlying businesses, their strength, the ability to sustain the cash flow and that's why we raised the dividend. So I feel very good about cash flow. We'll make adjustments as we go, and we have not in the past provided guidance and we're not intending to do that in the future. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. I guess can you \u2013 switching gears a little bit, can you talk about market conditions in bleached board? A competitor of yours mentioned there has been more imports coming in primarily on the commodity side of the business. Can you talk about what you're seeing on that side and what's your overlap on the commodity side of the business? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Phil. This is Mike Amick. As we look at the board business, clearly, Q4 is a seasonally slower time and we certainly saw that. But what we're seeing as we move into this year is backlogs and orders are responding as we expect to see. We're starting to see some of that pick up a little bit, which is typical for this time of the year. We have a good solid business and good customers and really targeted segments around food service. On the import side we are seeing some imports coming in. Our experience has been, primarily if you look across North America, that's in Latin America where we see that in some of the commodity segments. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And just one last one from me, I know seasonally, the containerboard business is weakest in November and February. Can you just kind of talk about broader market conditions, especially accounting for some of the capacity closures and downtime that industry has taken. I know there's certain limitations you can comment on pricing, but any color would be helpful because obviously investors are a little nervous that with the PPW cut, it's not one-and-done. Any color would be great. Thanks. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. Well, I can't comment on the industry; I'll comment on what we're doing and what we see. We're a big player in the export markets. Export markets have been volatile as we went through the second half of last year. But it's really been a volatility around price and margin, not a volatility around demand. There are some pockets where demand is a little bit weaker, mainly Turkey, which we're a very large supplier to that market and some of the Mid East conflict has spilled over. But on balance, demand has held up fairly well. And we continue to see that in the first quarter. January was right as we expected and February looks to be pretty solid from an advanced (31:41) standpoint. In the box business, as I said a minute ago, we're expecting roughly a flat absolute tonnage first quarter versus last year. And our model, our demand model that we use, says that the market could grow upwards of a percent in the first quarter. We've got some segment mix issues that we've been working through. We've been trailing market. We did up for all of 2015. So we'll probably underperform in the first quarter to what we think the market's going to grow. But overall, it's about like what we expected. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful just because comps are pretty tough in the first quarter, if I remember correctly last year. Thanks. Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Yeah, they are. It's the toughest quarter of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. One, Tim, perhaps for you, just on the sequential decline of box prices in North America in the fourth quarter, what drove that exactly and is it fair to assume that, that had nothing to do with anything that Pulp & Paper Week did in recent months? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Yeah, that's correct. It did not. And a big portion of that was mix. So what you see flowing through the EBIT impact is about $1, or maybe slightly more than $1 in price that came through as we went through contract negotiations with customers during the course of the year. The rest of it was mix, which means it hits price, but it doesn't necessarily hit margin. So boxes sell for different prices. As your customer mix and your segment mix changes, it can move price, but it doesn't change margin. So that's what it was, just a little bit of contract renegotiations that were flowing through. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And is that a seasonal issue, Tim, or not necessarily? And should we see that every fourth quarter? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Not necessarily. I mean we can, in any given year or given the size of the business, we can renegotiate anywhere from 1 million tons to 2 million tons of business with large customers, just because of how the contract periods fall. So it just depends on what's happening in the quarter and what gets agreed to and finalized in the quarter. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And, Carol, one for you, just on taxes. Can you talk about what your cash taxes were in 2015 versus your book taxes? I mean, obviously, there has been a substantial gap between the two over the past several years, and I'm just wondering what it was in 2015 or what your expectations are in 2016 and beyond for that matter? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. There was a gap between book and actual again in 2015 and you'll see that when the K will come out very shortly. And that was driven of course by the voluntary contribution to the pension, which creates a nice tax deduction. Over time, as we've told everybody, we do anticipate that our cash taxes will go up and start to approach the statutory rate. But there's still some time before that actually comes totally to fruition. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Tim, I wondered if you could just talk about that 230,000 tons of containerboard downtime in the fourth quarter. How much of that is seasonal or transitional or does it maybe suggest that you need to think about your \u2013 rethink your footprint? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : No, I don't think it's a question of footprint. There's a number of factors, Mark, that played into it. First of all, we did have more of a shortfall in our export channel in the fourth quarter than we anticipated now. As I said a moment ago, it has bounced back in the first quarter, so that was one element, fewer days. But the other thing that's going on, we've got a much better in-stock position of our old stock in our box plants than we've traditionally had over the past two years or three years. So that helped as well. And then probably the last one, we did see an improved efficiency in our supply chain network. There were more railcars available. There were more trucks available. It could be that that's just a point in time and it doesn't continue as a trend. But we were reacting to just the velocity at which inventory was flowing through the system as well. So it's just you look at a macro number for what we do around downtime, but that's not how we manage it. We're managing thousands of SKUs, 200 locations and trying to get the right product in the right place at the right time. And so that all factors into the amount of downtime we take or don't take. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then if I could kind of follow on with you, Tim, on packaging. The Brazilian businesses is significantly underperforming, can you kind of help us understand the issues there, and then what do you think the timeline looks like to getting that business at least close to the peers? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, good morning, Mark. This is Mark Sutton. I'll take the Brazil question and relieve Tim of that because... Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...we've got that as part of our Brazil team. The challenges with the business is obviously Brazil's in a pretty significant recession. The business we have it is pretty much all a domestic business. It doesn't have a large export, it doesn't have an export position, which is the model that's more typical, which is exporting kraftliner. We use everything we make. And so you got demand down pretty much tracking with negative GDP and what's been a challenge and we're making progress is the ability to get pricing to, at a minimum, offset inflation. So we raised containerboard prices in the fourth quarter. Those are implemented and we're in the process of raising box prices. But being 100% dependent on the Brazilian economy, which I think for the long-term is not a bad thing, for the last couple of years and for this year and maybe the next year, it's a bit of a challenge. So we're just trying to stabilize our business, make sure we have the right customers. We've taken out a lot of cost, but we obviously have to get some inflation recovery and that's what we're working on. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then finally, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the impact of the duties in the North American white paper market and whether you \u2013 how you read the impact as we roll into 2016? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Mark. This is Mike Amick. Good question. As you know, there was a ruling here a couple weeks ago with respect to kind of finalizing the duties and there was some movement there. There's \u2013 ITC will basically have their hearing on the second week in February and then we'll kind of know the outcome relative to injury. The best way to answer that right now is to kind of look at \u2013 what we kind of expect to see as a run rate and how this has impacted imports say versus 2014. And we're somewhere in the range of say 300,000 tons to 400,000 tons of the imports that have kind of come out of the market with respect to the duties. But we'll wait and see how the ITC rules in February. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And, Mike, is there any sense of sort of where inventory stands because there's been a lot of talk that there was a lot of inventory that got built in the country by some of the offshore producers? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Mark, I mean, the inventories that we see right now and what we track is a lot of the industry numbers that you see as well. We see those as being kind of in the normal range. We saw some slight pickup in the fourth quarter, but nothing that we would characterize is being unusually abnormal. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Two questions. IP and others have said that you need more inventory to deal with the logistics issues that we're having. But as we look at overall inventories, do you think that there's a chance that the industry maybe overshooting in aggregate? I'm just trying to recalibrate. I look at 2.5 million tons, which is a lot more than we've seen in the past and especially with all the supply chain work, maybe that's a little high? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Mark, it's Tim. I can only comment on what we do and how we run our system. We did feel as we went through last year that we needed more because of some of the difficulties we were facing in terms of just car, railcar and truck availability. As I mentioned a minute ago, that changed in December. I don't know that that's a trend. I don't think it is necessarily because nothing stands still, people react. But we had better velocity through the system in the fourth quarter. It continued into the first part of January, and we'll see how it plays out over balance of the year. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And just one other question. You've now taken several substantial asset write downs in the last couple of quarters. I'm wondering if that's part of a concerted effort on your part to get these assets on the books at the right numbers or if you think that there are more of these coming? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Mark, this is Carol. It's just part of the normal process of running the company properly. We do goodwill impairment testing with our strategic plans every year in the fourth quarter as we did that testing. Clearly, we had the issue with Orsa, so we wrote that goodwill off. So that's just part of normal running of the company. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, and congratulations on a strong cash year in 2015. I wanted to kind of come back to and you gave some \u2013 Tim, you gave some color around what you thought industry and yourselves might look like in 1Q and I kind of wanted to spend a minute and talk a little bit about all of 2016. In particular, we have an extra day this year, a few other elements, hopefully, a little bit of the normal stuff population growth, increasing e-commerce, et cetera. How do you feel about full year 2016? Could we see another point, a-point-and-a-half, two points of corrugated consumption box growth in full year 2016, part one. And then part two, IP has lagged a little bit the industry and could you maybe give us a little color on what you were talking about with some of the mix and issues and things there and could that begin to kind of revert back to averages? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Well, just on the last part, we're making choices and we're in segments that we've been in for a long time. We \u2013 those customers in those segment shift, some year's segments perform better than other years and so it'll ebb and flow. But we're trying to make commercial decisions, choices that we think sustain margins and build value over time. On your question on growth for the year, yeah, I do think that it could be in that point to point-and-a-half range. That's what our model says. Having said that, box consumption's not totally disconnected from the economy. So it'll depend on economic performance as we go through the year. But right now, what we see in terms of how the economy is performing, there's no reason to believe that it would be less than that 1% to 1.5% that we saw last year. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mark, a quick question on kind of the portfolio as you sit today. Look, I mean prices, obviously, equity markets have been hit pretty hard, yourselves included. But as you look at a cash-on-cash return and opportunity, how you think about M&A, done a lot of work on the portfolio kind of getting out of some parts, pieces globally that you've wanted to, from where you sit today, what's the temperature or the appetite to look at opportunity to add to the portfolio? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Chris, that's a great question. I mean I think it's a constant process of looking at ways to create more value for our shareholders and to make the company better and a longer-term value creator. So we got a lot of parts of our portfolio or as I described really excellent positions, great fiber baskets, super customer list, wonderful operations, assets and people, but there's other areas where we're still working and we'll continue to do that to improve the company. But our focus area is really creating value and growing the value of the company. And if M&A can play a role as we've said before, then it'll be on the table. But it'll be targeted in our areas of creating value, advantage positions and serving, growing solid end markets, not just about growth rates of unit volume or anything, but really going after where we can find profit pools that we can be a competitive right to win kind of company. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital : Hi. This is actually John Dunigan sitting in for Scott. Good morning. Just one question or a couple questions on couple of segments. Within corrugated packaging, the global cost curve appears to be flattening out due to FX with lower cost produced in Brazil and in Russia. How is this affecting the global trade flow and the ability for North American producers to export? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : Well, again, I can only speak to how we're looking at it. Yeah, they've gotten more cost competitive on currency. And we do see them in all of the markets that we operate in and so they're there. We're competing against them. It may cost us some margin to do that, but it's also not an unlimited amount of capacities that they have in the moment to penetrate the markets that we operate in. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital : Okay. And then in the printing papers segment, have there been any impact from the anti-dumping duties yet and any firming up in the demand or pricing post duties? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, John. This is Mike Amick. As discussed a little bit earlier, there has been some pullback in imports that we've experienced, say over the last 18 months or so. We think that that's \u2013 we may see a little bit more of that, but it's primarily probably pretty well leveled out and we'll see how that plays out in 2016. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you. And then finally, with OCC forecast that were down about 15%, 20% in 2015 and some forecast showing increase into 2016, where do you think they could be for the year or do you have any further color on that? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : On OCC, no, I mean commodity market, global markets, a lot of puts and takes, very hard to forecast. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : John, this is Mark. In addition to Tim's comment, one of the things that we've seen in OCC is they're just a practical issue with the cost curve, is that when you get in the area where prices are now, you get to a point where collecting the final marginal tons becomes uneconomic. So what ends up happening is there's some kind of self regulating supply disruption that occurs. And so \u2013 and there's not a lot of inventory in this system normally, so that's why it kind of springs around. But we think people are collecting more, which long-term is a good thing. But we do think that there's still a practical issue of what it costs to collect that highest cost marginal ton, which is probably curbside and the kind of things that municipalities are doing and then people just stopped doing it. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the year. I guess first question I had, Mark, I want to piggyback a little bit on one of the earlier questions. So you've been in the seat now for a while and you've had the opportunity to review the portfolio and the strategy of the company. Recognizing that things are going to be fluid going forward, right, it's not a static market, have you in your view determined which businesses you'd like to be in, which markets you want to continue to grow into or would you say you still have some further study to do in terms of the markets and your positioning there? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've pretty much determined where we want to take the company going forward. And it's in the areas that we've been working on. We want to grow our packaging business and we want to have businesses that \u2013 it's not so much the product focus but the competitive advantage. Where we have advantaged assets and advantaged fiber basins, making products for growing markets, fiber-based products, we win. When we don't have that, we struggle and so that's really the strategic focus of the company is improving the company. We've got a really great company right now, and it can be improved. But that's \u2013 we know where we want to go and we know where we don't want to go. And we'll continue to evolve. And as we have something to talk about, when we can, we will. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I appreciate that, Mark. Is it possible, and maybe the answer is no, but could you put a geographic tilt on what you just said? I mean do you see more opportunity in the Americas versus rest of the world or however you would frame it? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say, if you look at some of our actions over the last year, both things we've done and then things we haven't done... George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...I would say that our view of the Americas is strong. We like our business, again, where we have advantaged positions in the value add to the renewable natural resource of wood fiber. So the markets we serve \u2013 even China, when we talked about exiting our businesses, the market is still important. That is what the Ilim joint venture is mostly about, and we export 25% of what we make in the U.S. is exported because it's globally competitive. It's containerboard, it's fluff pulp and it goes to those markets. But we don't necessarily need to have manufacturing assets in every geography in the world. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Two questions on rest of the world; Ilim had a real nice performance. Is there a way you could comment to or maybe remind us on what you think the longer-term dividend opportunity is in Ilim, so that you get maybe more cash flow and more attention paid for what's a very good asset relative to its carrying value on the books. And then within Brazil, recognizing there were differences in terms of your business versus maybe your peers, is it possible to quantify maybe what your level of underperformance is relative to what your opportunity would be, your opportunity set, given your mix of business? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : George, this is Carol. On the Ilim dividend, a real simple way to think about that is, as the business performs better, clearly, there's cash generation. And of course, we're respectful of our joint venture partners and we have a board \u2013 very good governance of that company of which we're half the board. So what that company does is, generally, the decision around that dividend is in the timeframe of the summer time, where they look kind of backwards at the prior year and see the performance and the cash is there. So, as you could read into that, you could expect as we evaluate the dividend for 2016, we'll be looking back at the performance of 2015 and it was very strong. And on a real simple way, is you could think about it as simply as our equity earnings could in theory match the dividend of the company. And then that would be excluding the FX non-cash because that is non-cash. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that Carol. And on Orsa? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, George, on Orsa, with the earlier answer to the question, I think that Mark asked on Brazil, with the current economic environment, it's \u2013 and being totally focused on the Brazilian market, it's hard to guess on the time. But we should be able to get that business under normal market conditions to reasonably good margins. We will probably always have some gap if an export position of Kraftliner improves the business at any given moment in time because that's not what we do there. We got that business to begin to develop a packaging presence in Brazil, which we think long-term is a good idea. We did it in a way that's 100% committed to the local market. And it is different than others do it. It's \u2013 so it's always going to have a different business model for the foreseeable future. We need a better economy and we need to be able to get some inflation recovery, which we're working very, very hard on. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. I will turn it over. Have a good quarter. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. I know you guys have touched on the paper business a number of times on volumes, but in 2016 obviously some dynamics impacting the year \u2013 sorry, 2015. But what is your thought process on volumes going forward? Are we kind of \u2013 is the decline in paper not 3% to 5% on a go-forward basis or do you think you've hit a tipping point here where maybe it's a little bit less? Could you just comment on that? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Debbie. This is Mike Amick. Just commenting on the demand environment that we have. The data that you see out there for 2015, the overall uncoated free sheet market and paper market was down in the 1% range. And \u2013 but if you look at it over the course of the last couple of years, it's basically been down around 3% to 3.5%, which is kind of what it's been tracking at and what we see happening kind of going forward. In our business in particular, we had a very strong year last year going with some very good clients and very good customers in the right segments. We expect to do well in 2016 as well. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more about box shipments. Tim, is the implication that, yeah, you might be a little below the industry in Q1, but as you work on your mix of business, that we could see a shift in that as the quarters progress or is that something that it may be more of a 2017 event? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : We'll see how it plays, Debbi. I mean our view on our own business is that we'll be flat in the first quarter. We have a view that the market will grow, but we'll see how the economy plays out. We have exposure to certain segments, protein being one of them that, underperformed last year, given the some of the difficulties that they were \u2013 the protein customers were facing. And that's still yet to start really recovering. So we'll see how that plays out over 2016. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just one last one on exports. Just given your commentary on pricing volatility and you made a reference to weakness in Turkey, should we expect your export shipments to continue to decline from the current levels that you're currently sending out? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : We don't see that in the first quarter. We actually expect exports to rebound. January looks like it's coming in about where we expected it, February looks solid, pricing could drift down. We think it's not a huge drift, but I don't know if markets are beginning to stabilize just yet. But from a volume standpoint, first quarter looks better than fourth. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danny Moran with Macquarie. Danny Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On \u2013 in our heat map you showed some improvement from North American packaging operations sequentially, but it doesn't sound like this is going to be up too much. Just wanted to get your thoughts, you took a significant amount of economic downtime in 4Q, so I would think as you lap this into 1Q, there'll be a pretty nice sequential improvement. Any \u2013 can you give any color here? Timothy S. Nicholls - Senior Vice President, Industrial Packaging : I think, it's \u2013 Danny, it's Tim. I think it's somewhat a different quarter. We've got more outages. Seasonally, it's different. So I think it's going to depend. It's always a difficult quarter for us to gauge on operations. Last two years, we were impacted by weather. So far, we've kind of gotten the pass on weather. So I think the best thing is just to let us tell you about how it went when we get to the end of the first quarter. Danny Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And then can you just provide any thoughts on inflation this year? I know you hit on OCC, but we've seen cost deflation help out quite a bit, should we expect this to continue through the year or do you think fixed cost inflation could be more than an offset this year? Carol Louise Roberts - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : This is Carol. I would say on the input side, our overall view of input is fairly muted this year, wouldn't call it stable, I just call it muted because we got some things that are very low levels like energy. And then we've got wood costs that have more to do with some other nature and that seem a little stubbornly high and I think Tim already mentioned OCC. On the other side, general inflation, our goal is, as I mentioned on our bridge on 2015, our goal is to offset all the other inflations that we see each year with our initiatives in manufacturing. And that inflation number is probably in the range of a $200 million to $225 million and that's on people and services and what not. And our goal on that as it is every year for International Paper is to offset that with just running better and improvement, which we've been doing. Danny Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Great. That's helpful and all for me. Good luck in the year. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Hey. Thanks very much for taking my questions, solid Q4. Just you signaled pulp pressure, and I just wanted to get some comments with respect to Ilim in your North American business. And then just on North America, just Riegelwood conversion, I understand that qualification for fluff by the end of the year, but how do you expect the absorption of that extra 400,000 tons into the market, i.e., when will it be done? W. Michael Amick Jr. - Senior Vice President, North American Papers, Pulp & Consumer Packaging : Hey, Paul, this is Mike Amick. In terms of the pulp, as Carol mentioned in her opening slide, we expect to be up and running in the May timeframe and kind of fully ramped up in terms of the production of that machine in the last, latter part of this year. In terms of the pressure that, that we're seeing out there, overall, last year, as we look at strategically where we're focused and where we're growing, we had a good year in our fluff growth, delivering at about 4%, 4.5% on our growth, so felt really good about that which is, hence, the need for the incremental capacity and the growth that we got planned for this year and going forward. On Ilim? Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'll take the Ilim question, Mike. Thank you. Paul, on Ilim, we've seen some trail off in pricing as we finished the year. We still see that spilling a little bit into the first quarter. But it seems like the softwood pulp things are beginning to stabilize, and so that's kind of how our view is right now. Ilim is interesting because even with pricing pressures, we also have an (1:00:42) ever improving cost position. So our margins and the financial aspects of the business are still very strong. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We have reached our allotted time for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back to Jay Royalty for final thoughts and closing remarks. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, I'll let Mark make a couple of comments before I wrap it up. Mark S. Sutton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jay. And I just wanted to kind of wrap up. We had a very robust discussion about 2015 and also about our first quarter. I think we're well positioned to execute well. We've been outlining (1:01:17) some issues we got to manage through the first quarter. And I think what we talked about in the full year, we feel very good about. International Paper is well positioned to generate very strong cash flow and generate very strong returns for full year 2016, and we look forward to tracking that along the way as we report out the quarter. So we really are excited about the opportunities in front of us for this year. Jay Royalty - Vice President- Investor Relations : Well, thanks, Mark, and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call and our numbers are on slide 22 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great day.",

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you and I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Jay Royalty : Thanks Brandy and good morning everyone and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter of 2016 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered solid first quarter driven by continued strong performance in our North America Industrial Packaging business along with improved results in our global papers business. Demand across our businesses was at or slightly better than expectations. Our operations performed well and input costs were favorable. The Riegelwood conversion to fluff pulp was completed several days ago and we had have commenced start-up and qualifications. The Ilim JV had another strong quarter of results and we announced a couple of important strategic moves both of which will benefit IP\u2019s returns and are really all about making our best business, our Industrial Packaging business even better. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Asia Industrial Packaging, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We also reached an agreement to acquire state-of-the-art newsprint mill in Spain from Holmen Paper, which we plan to convert to high performance recycled linerboard to strengthen our value proposition to our customers and enhance the results for our European Industrial Packaging business. We plan to use all of that containerboard inside of our converting system. Turning to Slide 6, just like to give you a little more color on our financial performance. IPs revenue declined year-over-year, its primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China, which took place in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also incurred cost of about $45 million exclusive of outage expenses associated with the Riegelwood conversion and this was a significant drag to earnings in the quarter. Margins would have been about 100 basis points better absent this impact. Our free cash flow of $311 million was on par with last year\u2019s first quarter. At this point, what I would like to do is turn it over to Carol and she will walk us through the performance of our individual businesses and the second quarter outlook. Then I\u2019ll return to wrap it up and we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. Carol. Carol L. Roberts: Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a sold first quarter at $0.80 EPS with favorable operations and input cost offset by lower prices, seasonally lower volume and heavy maintenance outages including the Riegelwood conversion. The positive swing at Ilim is FX related primarily due to the strengthening of the Ruble as it relates to the JV\u2019s U.S. dollar denominated net debt. Turning to the businesses on Slide 8. Industrial Packaging as Mark said, had a strong quarter, we had favorable operations and lower input cost, but they were mostly offset by lower export and box pricing, seasonally lower box volume as expected and high planned maintenance outage expense. Export volume did rebound from a weak fourth quarter. The North American business took 212 tonnes of economic downtime to balance our supply with our demand and adjust our needs to match a more efficient supply chain. Input costs were positively impact by lower cost of OCC diesel fuel. Turning to Slide 9, IP\u2019s North America box demand came in generally as expected with year-over-year volume up 1.3% for the first quarter, which was in line with the industry. The quarter finished and strong in March and that momentum has continued through April. As you can see in the table, which highlights several of IP\u2019s key customer segments, we see several encouraging trends. We continue to see strong growth in online retail, which has become more meaningful for overall demand, the large process through segment is beginning to show some positive signs as a major companies are making moves to adjust to changing consumer preferences. The agricultural segment which IP is a major supplier, is enjoying the most favorable weather conditions the regions have seen in a few years and this points solid growth of the 2016. And the outlook for the important protein segment is improving, so net-net a fairly favorable outlook for the business. Turning to Europe as Mark mentioned, we recently announced a strategic move to require a unique asset that can be converted to very effectively complement our corrugated packing network in the region. This transaction will create significant value from both the customer offering and financial standpoint, as it will enable IP to produce to high performance lightweight recycled containerboard in region. We will acquire the mill along with associated recycling operations and Holmen\u2019s ownership position in an onsite per generation facilities Upon closing of the deal, we will initiate plans for the conversion of the state-of-the-art news print machine to a first cortile test liner machine, which we expect to complete in late 2017. Once we configured, the machine will produce 420,000 short time of recycled containerboard, which will enable IP to integrate a majority of our test liner needs. The total investment for the acquisition and conversions is expected to be approximately $160 million with an expected IRR of more than 15%. If you turn to Slide 11, in addition to the attractive age and technology of the machine, as well as mill configuration, the location of the mill in relation to the majority of our box network is very attractive. The grades of high performance test liner that we intend to produce on this machine have the greatest application for our broad base of industrial customers and most of these are served out of box plants in Spain, France and Northern Italy as shown on the highlighted area of the map. So once again, we're excited about the prospect of this move and what it can do for our customers and International Paper. Turning now to Slide 12, let me talk about consumer packaging where we saw a seasonally slower quarter combined with some pricing pressures, a less favorable mix and heavier outage expense resulted in lower earnings for the business in the first quarter. Most of the pricing pressure was felt in the commodity place segment. The timing of volume and higher value mix in the food service business was slower to materialize than we had expected as well. Additionally, the sale and exit of the Coated Bristols business negatively impacted results in the quarter. Now moving to Slide 13 and talking about our printing paper segment, the slide shows a sequential bridge for the entire segment, which does include our pulp business. As was mentioned earlier, the cost and tax of the Riegelwood conversion, along with the sub-optimized operation at Riegelwood as conversion of PM18 was underway, significantly impacted segment results to the first quarter by approximately $45 million in total. we'll continue to see cost impact from the conversion in the second quarter along with startup and qualification cost that will continue to impact results in the second quarter and the second half of 2016. This is consistent with the outlook, we provided last quarter and is fully captured in the outlook that I'll share with you shortly. Slide 14 shows the result of the global paper segment excluding pulp and the impact of the conversion. Volume was seasonally weaker as we expected larger in Brazil, while demand in North America was solid. Good operations and lower input cost contributed favorably to the result, as is lower planned maintenance average expense. Prices were lower in North America but higher in Europe, Russia and Brazil, as we began to see the benefit of the implementation as previously announced price increases, some price increases are announced in North America and are being implemented in the second quarter. Let me give a little more color on Riegelwood, as Mark said, we are pleased that the conversion has been completed on-time and on-budget in the month of April and startup and qualification of the machine has commenced. Production of softwood market pulp is underway and then we'll move to qualification of fluff pulp, we expect to begin fluff trials in the third quarter. The current pricing environment for softwood market pulp, which is use for paper towel and tissue product is under pressure in the near-term. As we ramp up and produce SBSK on the new machine through the rest of 2016, these current conditions will adversely affect earning. This will improve as we qualify fluff pulp on the new machine and optimize production across our system. Turning now to our Ilim JV, JV had another very strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $176 million and strong manufacturing performance partially offset lower pulp prices and seasonally lower volume. Over the course of the first quarter the Ruble strengthened slightly against the dollar, which resulted in a favorable non-cash FX gains on the JV, $600 million of U.S. denominated net debt and that impacted or first quarter earnings favorably by $0.03 per share. Lower pulp prices and seasonally higher wood cost along with planned maintenance outages at the Bratsk and Koryazhma mills are expected to negatively impact second quarter results. So before I turn it back over to Mark, let me give you the second quarter outlook. Earnings will increase due to seasonally higher volume in North American box and Brazil papers. The additional box volume is expected to favorable impact North America Industrial Packaging earnings by roughly $40 million. The impact of seasonally stronger demand in Brazil is expected to positively impact earnings by $10 million. Moving on to pricing in North America, the expected impact of lower pulp prices in a less favorable mix associated with the ramp up of Riegelwood on softwood pulp in the second quarter ids about a negative $20 million. This is net of the benefits of the previously announced price increases in uncoated free sheet in North America. Pricing for North America Industrial Packaging will be impacted by lower export pricing along with the flow through of the January PPW index change that will move through the boxes. Combined, this is expected to negatively impact earnings in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Prices are expected to improve in Brazil papers as a previously announced price increases are implemented. This will favorably impact earnings by about $10 million. Operational costs in North America Industrial Packaging are expected to improve as a result of seasonally stronger demand and utilization along with other cost reduction and improvement initiative. This will be a benefit of roughly $30 million. Operational cost across the other businesses are expected to remain favorable and input costs are expected to remain generally favorable as well, although we do expect some slight pressure in Europe. Maintenance outage expense will continue to be heavy in the second quarter, but are expected to decrease by a total of $22 million as shown on the slide, mainly due to the lower outage cost at Riegelwood. And relative to the Ilim JV, the items you see on the chart are expected to negatively impact IP equity earnings by approximately $10 million to $15 million and additionally we are assuming stable FX coming out of the quarter as you know we don\u2019t attempt to forecast currency. So the outlook assumes a non-repeat of a $0.03 from the first quarter. So with that overview, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton: Thank you Carol. So let me wrap things up before we take your questions. I feel really good about our execution in results from the first quarter and I\u2019m encouraged that demand feels more favorable across the primary markets that we serve. Our focus remains on the execution and we saw benefit from our efforts in the first quarter in terms of good operational performance and lower cost. The conversion at Riegelwood went well, it was on-time and on-budget and our team is now ramping up and qualifying the new capability. All of this will enable International Paper to continue to generate strong free cash flow which we will allocate to create additional value. We\u2019ve also made some key decisions that will improve IP\u2019s portfolio and make it stronger and further improve returns on invested capital, namely our decisions in Asia and Madrid and you will see more of this as we move forward where it makes sense for International Papers and our stakeholders. We have winning strategies in the right markets and our focus is clear as you are seeing in the moves we are making. We are focused on producing products where we have a distinct advantage with good access to fiber and low cost manufacturing. We are concentrating our efforts on the markets and product lines that give IP the greatest potential to generate meaningful earnings and attractive returns. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions] in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark and Carol, two part question for my first question. Do you still expect D&A expenses of $1.3 billion this year, just given that they fell a bit below what I was expecting this quarter? And relatedly, your EBITDA was down 14% in the first quarter. Do you still think you can be close to flat this year, or if not, what do you think reasonable expectations are along those lines for EBITDA? Thank you. Carol L. Roberts: Adam this is Carol and I\u2019ll take the first one on the D&A. Yes, we do still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion, what happens is there is some variability to it when you have milled down from outages, you stop your depreciation for that period of time. So it\u2019s just really just some lumpiness in it but overall $1.3 billion is still a good number for the year. Mark S. Sutton: Adam on EBITDA, your question about how we feel about the flat year-over-year, it\u2019s obviously got some scratch in it with some of the pricing headwinds that has occurred, but at the same time as I mentioned in my comments, we feel really good about our execution and our ability to make improvements in our businesses, both commercially and operationally. So I think we\u2019re very much still in the range we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that. We got a lot of the year left and we've got some real positive trends on our commercial front and we\u2019re operating very, very well. so we are all about focused on hitting that EBITDA that we talked about. Adam Josephson : Thanks Mark. And just one on containerboard exports. Can you just comment - forgive me if I missed this, on what your export volumes were sequentially and year-over-year. Obviously, the trade press has talked about export prices falling to cash costs for some of the higher cost mills in the U.S. I'm just hoping you can address this issue and thanks very much. Timothy S. Nicholls: Hey Adam this is Tim. Demand actually is holding up reasonably well in the fourth quarter, I think we called out - our volume was down, we called out some reasons around that that were situational and we thought temporary and in the first quarter we saw a rebound, then export volumes up. We were still a little bit lower in total than we were in the first quarter of last year. Part of that - in fact a big part of it is really Turkey and the dumping tariff that has been imposed then just simply how we're thinking about our participation in the market. It\u2019s still a very key market for us, but not every account there is equal and so we made some decisions in terms of how we were going to position ourselves in the first quarter and going forward. I would say demand is good, our price gets written about a lot, it doesn't feel like our experience is quite as negative as all the things that has written about it, but there is no doubt, there are some competitive situations out there and there is a little bit of price pressure. That will probably continue as we go through the second quarter. Adam Josephson : Thanks very much Tim, I appreciate it. Timothy S. Nicholls: Sure. Operator : Your next question is comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning. Mark, I wondered if you guys, maybe you and Tim, could just help us a little bit as we think about these PPW adjustments back in February and how they roll through first quarter, second quarter and into the second half. Mark S. Sutton: Mark, I'll ask Tim to take that Timothy S. Nicholls: Good morning Mark. Yes I mean Carol kind of spotted a number, it was fairly minimal in the first quarter, we're dealing customer-by-customer and contract-by-contract and they don't all work exactly the same way. And certainly given the timing of the PPW adjustments in the first quarter, not very much of that flow through in the quarter. it will ramp up in the second quarter and Carol pointed out a combination of PPW and export being between $25 million and $30 million. The bulk of that we think is because of the price adjustment with the index and we'll talk to you about third and fourth quarter as we go through the year, as we continue to work through all of the customer contract. So but you will see a fairly significant step-up first to second. Mark Wilde : Okay. And Tim, as we think about trying to model out the third and fourth quarter, would it be fair to assume some additional bleed-through carrying into third and fourth quarter? Timothy S. Nicholls: Possibly it's hard to say Mark. I mean, I would rather do the work and get through it and then talk to you that what we think it will be in the third quarter as we finish the second quarter with the same we did going into this quarter. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. That's fair. And just staying on the containerboard and Industrial Packaging business, you have taken about 440,000 tonnes of economic downtime over the last six months. I wondered if you could talk about how you're taking that. Are you slowing back? Are you actually idling machines for a week or two here or there? And is there a point where you need to consider a longer term move on the supply side? Timothy S. Nicholls: Well, we'll see, I think the power of what we're doing is just as the power of the system and the flexibility that we've built and some of the investments that we're making is all around building capability and flexibility in the system. We know that when you're stretching the system in terms of utilization rates, things don\u2019t always work out the way you want them to and we've built a tremendous amount of flexibility and a very strong system. so I can't say what it will be going forward. What I can say is, we look over a multiple periods, out months at a time, not just within a quarter and we target where we think we need to be, in terms of how we run the system and then we adjust that almost day-to-day and week-to-week based on a variety of factors. One thing that happened in the fourth quarter really late third and continues to be a factor is just how efficiently the supply chain network is running right now and so what it meant for at moment in time as we need less inventory and so we've adjusted our production accordingly to match that. We'll have to monitor that overtime, things don\u2019t stay the same, they have a tendency to move around, so we'll have to see how supply chain performs through the rest of the year. Mark S. Sutton: Mark, if I could just add to Tim\u2019s comment. One of the things we've learned as our system has been optimized and its gotten as large as its gotten. We clearly create more value in our containerboard and box system, when there is a bit flexibility in the system and we create less value when we try to run everything to its limits and I mean commercial value and our ability to respond to customers, run an efficient box network and also actual cost value in properly maintaining the equipment before the expensive failures occur. And so that few percent on maintenance and that few percent on economic flexibility, economic downtime really ends up creating the best opportunity for us to generate the highest margins. So it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t look to solve to zero, because I think if it was zero we would have a very difficult commercial proposition for our customers. Mark Wilde : Alright. That\u2019s really helpful Mark. Good luck in the second quarter and trough balance of the year. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Timothy S. Nicholls: Good morning Steve. Steve Chercover : First question. Hi Tim. I wanted to ask about the announcement of a new fluff pulp mill in Arkansas at a cost of $1.3 billion. Will that seriously upset the supply demand dynamic, and what does it say about the value of fluff pulp assets, perhaps? Mark S. Sutton: Steve, we saw that we had a little bit of knowledge about the background there. It\u2019s hard to predict what that facility is going to do and when. I think fluff pulp is a highly technical product, you have to have a customer list and a track record. So it will be an open question about whether or not a mill that\u2019s in theory can make the product actually ends up with a large book of business in that. And there are different degrees of absorbent products that are loosely lumped into fluff. What we concentrate on is the higher end, high performance products that are medical device type of products. So can\u2019t speculate on what that particular company is going to try to do, but obviously there is a lot to being successful in fluff pulp over the long-term, primarily because of the branded nature of the consumer product that it goes into. And we\u2019ve been added for a while and have a premium customer list that wants us to continually provide them new material? Steve Chercover : Did you want to take the bait on the value of fluff pulp assets in general? Mark S. Sutton: I must not have, because I didn\u2019t. No I think my comments all fluff is not create equal and there are types of products I think should characterize the value of fluff pulp is a highly valuable product given the technical nature of it and the consumer branded equity that\u2019s behind those products that it goes into. Steve Chercover : Great. Thank you, Mark. And then a quick one for Carol. We know that the average shares outstanding was 414 million. Was the ending share count significantly different? Did you maybe ramp up the repo as your confidence grew through the quarter? Carol L. Roberts: I think we\u2019ll show that - the repo in the quarter was a $100 million and I\u2019m looking at my colleagues here on the final share count, but I think we can factor in the 100 million purchase and that\u2019s what we did in the quarter Steve. So its continuing to move down and are intent is to continue to be opportunistic with our buybacks. Steve Chercover : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey guys. Post Riegelwood, I would imagine a very large chunk of your business is more on the food service side, which is holding up okay, I would imagine, especially on the cup side. But with the PBW cut on SBS, is it about 40% of your business that gets impacted? And then how should we think about the lag in terms of it flowing through your P&L? W. Michael Amick : Hey Philip this is Mike Amick, yes the numbers are going to be roughly 30% to 35% of our business could potentially be impacted by that in 2016. We primarily see this being a second half phenomenon. Philip Ng : Okay. And how would you guys characterize supply/demand in the bleach board market? Certainly, Riegelwood should help. But I guess one of your competitors did bring back an idled mill, and then you've got some of that potential capacity making its way into the US market from the European. How do you guys think about supply/demand medium to longer term? Thanks. W. Michael Amick : So this is Mike again. I would characterize the demand is okay, I don\u2019t know that I have used the term really strong, but through the quarter we\u2019ve seen improving backlogs, order backlogs by almost 50% as we look through the quarter. So I think right now kind of sitting where we are in the first part of April, we\u2019re about where we were this time last year. Philip Ng : Okay. And just one last one from me. Mark, you talked about how demand in the quarter for containerboard firmed up with Ag picking up and e-commerce certainly seeing a lift, as well. Can you remind us how you're thinking about box shipments for the full year now, in light of some of the strength you've seen in 1Q? Mark S. Sutton: I\u2019ll let Tim take that. Timothy S. Nicholls: Yes, I mean last quarter we said we thought it would be for the full-year total market 1% to 1.5% I don\u2019t think our view has changed that much. I would say that we did see the quarters strengthen as we went through the first quarter and market is very strong for us. April continues to be very strong for us. Right now, Mark today we\u2019re in the up 2% range. So some of these segments that have been weighing against us over the past few quarters are starting to turn hopefully and we\u2019ll see if it holds up and we feel pretty good right now. Mark S. Sutton: Yes, I think Tim\u2019s point tells us that every organization has a mix, customer mix and we like what we\u2019ve seen in some of the trends and the mix that\u2019s particularly heavy for International Papers. So that should lead us to tracking a lot more consistent with what the overall market is doing versus maybe have past experience. So we feel good about that. Philip Ng : And the mix dynamic with protein potentially picking up in the back half, with the beef cycle turning, that should be a positive for you guys, as well. Are we thinking about that right? Timothy S. Nicholls: Yes, I think so, first thing, hopefully is stabilize and we'll see how it plays out the rest of year. Processed food actually for us this mix of customers that we have trended pretty favorably during the first quarter and looks like its holding up in the second quarter. I mean, I'm not going to specifics, but we saw individual names being two, three, four plus percent in the quarter and it got stronger as we went through the quarter. So its Ag, California is getting rain that's a good thing, so we're well positioned and in that part of the market and then everybody talks of e-commerce but it's really contribution, we've got a mix of customers across the e-commerce space as well as distribution and have show pretty good strength across the board. Philip Ng : Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question is comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. One quick follow-up on the DD&A question from before. I saw that the Consumer Packaging business was down quite a bit. Was that all Riegelwood? And I noticed that the pulp hadn't gone up. Does that go up once the conversion has taken place? Carol L. Roberts: Yes, Mark. What we did is, we moved that mill of Riegelwood which was a shared mill between the two segments, both coated paperboard segment and paper segment that's now moved all the way over into NAPP, so it's less coated paperboard hence the change there. And just was the mill down most of the quarter for the conversion and no actual annual outage that\u2019s what you saw, so that will not show up in the NAPP segment. Mark Weintraub : Okay. So the Consumer Packaging runs at this $25 million a quarter now in North America, instead of the $45 million it had been for DD&A?? Carol L. Roberts: Yes. Mark Weintraub : Analyst : Okay. And then on uncoated free sheet, is it fair to say that you are not reflecting a lot of impact from the price increase which is just currently underway in the second quarter, and so success on that, if it comes through, would largely show up in the third quarter and maybe if you could modify a little bit? W. Michael Amick : Well Mark, yes you are accurate in your statement, it will be. We started to see a little bit in second quarter, but it will primarily be a second half event and primarily split between the third and later part of third quarter and maybe a little in. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi everyone. Good morning. Congratulations on the performance, especially in Industrial. Had a couple questions. First of all, in Industrial, can you update us on your thoughts as to how you might be able to increase your vertical integration? Are you seeing opportunities for investment, either organically or through M&A, to be able to accelerate that, if that's still a goal? And the related point on containerboard, do you have a need for any similar moves like you did with Holmen, and what are the implications of that investment relative to your supply chain in North America? And I had a quick follow-on, if possible. Timothy S. Nicholls: On your first question, George, its Tim here, on integration, good morning. I would say we like all of the channels that we're in, we're operating in multiple channels, obviously the integrated channel is the largest and it's very important to us, it's going to come down to how we win accounts in the marketplace and align ourselves with customers within segments. So there is no stated specific goals that we have to reach at certain integration levels. Acquisitions, we don't comment on speculation, but we look at lot of things and so, we'll continue to do that and if one make sense then we'll be talking to everyone about what it is and why we think that makes sense. In terms of Holmen, we don't expect the big impact from one region to another at all, but the related question around are there things like that? I think that's what you see us doing in some of these investments that we're making. We've talked about increasing capacity and adding flexibility, it's not that all capacity is the same. What we're doing is we're adding capability around certain products that we think are growing through our segments and we think we need and we're building that capabilities. So, it's similar to Holmen, it's just different, we've got 16 mills where we can look at the product mix that we need to make investments accordingly. George Staphos : Okay, Tim. I'll turn it over, since I had my two, and I'll try to come back. Thank you. Timothy S. Nicholls: Thanks George. Operator : Your next question is comes from Lars Kjellberg of Credit Suisse. Lars Kjellberg : Hi. Just a question actually on the Holmen transaction. When I'm looking at your Industrial Packaging business in Europe, the problems seem to be that you have very low margins in your box business. This doesn't necessarily fix that problem. So how do we - are you thinking about addressing that business in itself, because just adding upstream integration doesn't necessarily fix what seems to be a low margin business. Mark S. Sutton: Lars hi, this is Mark. Building on Tim\u2019s comments about channel, the way we look at our European corrugated business. It\u2019s a very focused business, we look at it as one of our channels to market, we move very high quality high performance craft liners through that system. If you look at the geography, we\u2019re southern focused on fresh foods and so our view of that business is its part of our integrated channel to market and the integration of high performance recycled liner coupled with our U.S. produced high performance craft liner makes that whole value proposition better. It allows us to improve our customer mix and as you know from the European theatre, the recycled board that\u2019s available is geographically available. So you have to have what you need were you need it in a reliable way to build out your offering for your customers and that\u2019s what this does to improve that business. So what we focus on in our European corrugated business is very good for the company and when you take it back at look at the way we think about industrial packaging globally it\u2019s a really good business for IP. Lars Kjellberg : Just a follow-up on that. There's a tremendous amount of conversions that hits the market tail end 2017, early 2018. We're talking about almost 2 million tons. Is that a consideration at all for you as a non-integrated system today? Is this the right time to do it? Mark Sutton : Well that phenomenon Lars has been sort of a fixture in the European market. There has been a couple of million tonnes overhang. The problem with that statement is its on average and again recycled high performance liner is not all created equal, there are three to four grade levels including medium. And so what has to happen is converter like International Paper have to have what we need, where we need it. So if it\u2019s in the North of Europe, it\u2019s theoretical, even if it\u2019s an overhang, it doesn\u2019t really affect. So what you have to look at is regional capacity and we\u2019ve been a large open market buyer for a long period of time and we will still buy some, but that\u2019s how we look at it. Regional board for the conversion that you need in the market segments that you are focused on not the average container supply and demand for all of Europe, which is a very diverse market especially for the recycled liner. Lars Kjellberg : Very good. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA. Mark Connelly : Thanks. Just two quick things. Can you give us an update on the timing of the 250,000 tons of new containerboard capacity that you're adding here? We've talked about it as a gradual ramp. I'm just wondering if you can give us some sign posts and tell us when that would be up and running. And second, it looks like you've cut your containerboard maintenance numbers. Is that a change in scope or just improved efficiency? Timothy S. Nicholls: Hey Mark its Tim. On the first question of capacity there is really no difference than what we said at the time we announced that we said it is going to be a 16, 17 set of actions. So I don\u2019t know if its half/half, but you will see some of it come through this year and you will see a little bit more come through in the first half of next year. And then on maintenance, maintenance varies mill-by-mill and period-to-period and so there is a plan, there is a schedule that goes out years and you look at it piece of equipment-by-piece of equipment and it just happens that you will hit periods when the things that need to be tended to in an annual outage cost more, because of the nature of the work in a given period than in others. Carol L. Roberts: And I would add to that Mark, this is Carol, while we do see the reduction from the last time we forecasted the second quarter down is we know as a company that we\u2019ve got headwinds and so what we\u2019ve been trying to do of course is you have got to find other levers to pull. And so as Tim said, he is looking at is very hard to make sure he is doing what he needs to do and if there is an opportunity to turn some things up to get more money to the bottom-line that\u2019s what we\u2019re attempting to do. And we\u2019ll continue to disclose that each quarter so that you can follow and track those changes. Mark Connelly : That\u2019s really helpful. Mark S. Sutton: Mark this is Mark Sutton. Just the first question you asked, just to tie it back to an earlier question around how we run our system. That incremental capacity capability that\u2019s coming from these investments as Tim mentioned, is really about making some products differently that we\u2019ve made before, making our system more flexible meaning we can make similar products at the same mill or different so we can improve our supply chains. So the issue of capacity coming online is only when and if need it for the demand environment. It\u2019s really the driver is really making more of this and less of that for the boxes that we need to make going forward and as an outcome as improving those facilities, we have more capacity if we need more capacity. So that\u2019s kind of a way to think about that as appose to business coming on at this date and this is coming on at that date. It\u2019s coming on as a new product, a new basis weight, a new design. And net capacity comes on if we have the orders for it. it doesn\u2019t come on if we don\u2019t have the orders for it. Mark Connelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. John Dunigan : This is actually John Dunigan filling in for Scott Gaffner. Good morning and congrats on a strong quarter. Mark S. Sutton: Thank you. John Dunigan : Most of my questions, unfortunately, have been asked, but I did just have a couple. In particular, I wanted to ask about what you guys are seeing in the OCC prices and how the lower inputs have had an impact on your first quarter and then what you're expecting in terms of an outlook going forward for that and how it could affect IP? W. Michael Amick : Yes I mean, I think our forecast is that we could see some modest pressure in OCC pricing as we go through the second quarter. we don't expect it at this point to be a major factor and yes in the first quarter input is little bit of the tailwind for us which we're operating in a certain environment and trying to take advantage of environment that we have. John Dunigan : Okay. And some of your peers had discussed some of the freight benefits that they have been enjoying, particularly getting some discounts and even building up on some inventory to meet some just in time demand. Could you just touch upon what IP's seeing in terms of those costs and how you guys are maybe taking advantage, particularly in your Industrial and Packaging sector? W. Michael Amick : Well, I think part of what you've seen just in - what we've seen in terms of our supply chain network is rail and truck availability has improved dramatically in the last part of last year, early this year compared to where we were say year ago. So that's obviously having an impact on the discussions you have with carriers about rate structures, it\u2019s still a very challenged environment in some cases, in terms of those discussions, but we think we're having some measures of traction as we have those discussions. The bigger impact in the moment is just what it means to how we think about our stocking position across 200 plus facilities and its meaning at the movement that we need less inventory and we can run much more efficiency supply chain. So there is benefiting. That I think what we have worried about is how it changes overtime and will there be a snap back of utilization rates around carriers later this year John Dunigan : And you generally think in the near term here that you can still enjoy the benefits, with possibly a snap back late this year or maybe early next year? W. Michael Amick : I don't know when it's going to happen or if it will happen. I just know the thing don\u2019t say that people take actions and so we don't count on anything lasting. I think it goes back to the power of the system, we have tremendous flexibility and we're trying to create more flexibility through these investments. So that we can pull back when we need to and we can recover quickly when we need to. John Dunigan : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi Good morning. W. Michael Amick : Good morning Debbie. Debbie Jones : I was wondering if you could talk about the change you made to your management incentive plan in early February. It looks like you switched it up based on 50% operating cash flows to 50% EBITDA, with ROIC being the remainder. Is there anything we should read into that about your cash operating expenses in the coming years? Mark S. Sutton: Hi Debbie this is Mark. Well I think what we're attempting to do there, cash flow is still front in center. What we've got is that particular annual plan is focused on the majority of our employee, who are running on operation that's a level and type of job and we all talk of EBITDA in the company that's plans are based on, it\u2019s what people are measured on. And we've had little bit of slippage in our EBITDA progress over the last couple of years. so just an attempt to be focused and the overall scheme of things obviously cash from ops, start with a good strong EBITDA and then you go to the cash flow, free cash flow and your capital allocation strategy is clearly understood, commitment to the dividend. So no message other than focusing the people who are actually on that plan to look at ways we can improved our EBITDA and break through the flat nature of it over the last couple of years. So that's one plan for one year for certain group of employees. Debbie Jones : Can I just ask, do you still expect no pension contribution in 2016 and 2017? Carol L. Roberts: Debbie, what I would say is we have no required pension contribution for 2016 and 2017. Now how we go forward you know we will obviously navigate that as we move forward. Debbie Jones : Okay. And my last question, I just wanted to ask, we talk a lot about the substitution potential from craft liner to recycled liner and whether or not there's room to go, given the sustainably low OCC prices. And you see this from both vantage points, having exposure to both markets. I was wondering if you could comment on this, and then also how this might impact your longer term capacity plans. Timothy S. Nicholls: Yes, hey Debbie its Tim. We see in certain regions in certain areas there is either more or less competition from certain type of product range. I think the way we think about it is we're looking with our customers that best fit and best used for the packaging they need and it includes a variety of substrates, some virgin, some recycled fit for use. But it also includes capability, geography, service levels and so we're selling them more than just it recycled or is it virgin, we're selling them a total product and we've got breadth of product to do it like no others. So there is always going to be a competition, it\u2019s very competitive market, but we feel good about the value propositions we have. Debbie Jones : And then the question about the capacity plans in the future, just thinking about the tonnage that you're adding in the coming years. Timothy S. Nicholls: Yes, I don\u2019t want to speculate on what we will do or won\u2019t do. We\u2019ve got lowest OCC input cost at the moment, it\u2019s a moment in time we think it is probably a different trend overtime and we\u2019ll make decisions. It\u2019s like I talked about these capacity additions, we\u2019re not just adding generic tonnes, we\u2019re adding products and grades and basis weights for where we see growth in our channels and the types of products that we need to support that growth. So and then we run it accordingly as we\u2019ve said to what our demand is. So we constantly look at what are those products, what do they need to be, where should we add them and it will be an ongoing evaluation? Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck for the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Manuel : Good morning and congratulations for a great start to the year. Timothy S. Nicholls: Thanks Chris. Christopher Manuel : Two topics I wanted to touch on. First, a little bit more around - you are probably tired of talking about it, but some of the dynamics here with North American containerboard, and the second topic being Ilim. With respect to the first topic, I hear how you have answered Debbie and Mark's and a few others' questions around things. But if I look to downtime you took in 4Q and 1Q, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but it's now been two in a row that it's been solidly north of 200,000 tonnes. If we annualize that, that's larger than a machine, close to a mill, 900-ish thousand tons on an annual basis of downtime, market downtime. You also referenced you had some inventories coming down. So maybe you could help us, give us a sense as to when I look at industry inventories - they haven't really moved much the last few months, but maybe yours has. Could you give us a sense, maybe either in tonnes or in weeks supply or however you think about it, your inventories have changed 3Q to 4Q to 1Q? W. Michael Amick : I would say we run a very tight supply chain year around and we make adjustments as we go. So no I am not going to breakout tonnes or weeks of supply. I\u2019m just going to say that we\u2019re constantly looking at four-months to five-months in advance targeting where we think we need based on our demand signal and then we make adjustments as we run the system. So the downtime that we took in the fourth quarter and first quarter a very large component of that, goes back to supply chain efficiencies and just not needing as much inventory to our chain. That could change overtime and may be we\u2019re taking a little bit of risk on the downside in terms of how it might change and what we might do to be able to do to respond to it, but we just like to run a very tight supply chain and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Christopher Manuel : : So if I read into that a little, it sounds like your inventory levels over the last couple quarters have come down a good chunk then and they're not flat. W. Michael Amick : No, they are not flat and a lot of things go into targeting inventory levels, we run hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of grades, 200 locations and so we\u2019re looking product-by-product basis grades, locations and stocking levels across all of this and then we are adjusting the system quarterly. And if it just takes less time to get product from mill-to-box plan, because the velocity has increased and we obviously don\u2019t need as much inventory in the system. Christopher Manuel : Okay. Thank you. And with respect to Ilim, I've read several places it looks like you're going to do a pretty sizable expansion there. Could you maybe give us a little color as to what's happening in timing and things of that nature, and as well as while that's going on, what we would probably expect out of - would dividends stop for a while or how might that work? Mark S. Sutton: So Chris on the Ilim release that you are referencing they put out a five-year plan and it was a capital plan to improve the business. A big portion of that is inclusive of their normal maintenance and regulatory CapEx that\u2019s about $325 million annually. So the incremental that was in that announcement over that five-year period was about $700 million and its planned only if the project are developed and as they have the right returns to improve the current business that they have and to improve the quality of the product and its necessary to make more product at the second facility. And the plan for that would be to organize the funding in the same way the prior development of Ilim was done which is on the Ilim balance sheet and we don\u2019t see any effect on the dividend changing or going down or the things like that. So we think there is some good opportunities of improving Ilim. And it goes to that comment I made on my closing statement around making products that are needed in the market, mainly into consumer oriented end-users and making them in the right price in the world for your advantage, fiber, cost structure and work force and this is a perfect example of that. Carol L. Roberts: And Chris I\u2019ll just add on. We actually are going to get a dividend payment, I\u2019m looking at my colleague who is on the - cards around the board is Ilim joint venture last week approved the dividend payment for 2016. So we will receive a $50 million between $50 million to $55 million this year and another recommitment to the dividend flow out of the business given that its generating significant cash and also if you look at their debt balance, their debt has actually come down as well. So the financial condition of that business is great and we're counting on dividend out of that business as part of the value creation equation for International Paper. Christopher Manuel : Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck. Mark S. Sutton: Thank you Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Yes and good morning. W. Michael Amick : Good morning Chip. Chip Dillon : I just wanted to make sure I understood. You gave a lot of moving parts earlier in the call. And I know you said that the price impact of mainly pulp would be about, on the North American Paper business, would be somewhere around $20 million. But then I think you said that there's a benefit in Brazil of about $10 million. So I guess for that segment, looking at just pricing, the difference would be just $10 million, is that right, negative? Carol L. Roberts: Yes, those are two distinct items that we called out. So that would be the right way to look at Chip. Chip Dillon : Okay. And just so I understand, on the slides, it looks like the total benefit from less maintenance in the second quarter, I think adds up to $42 million, but then you called out some other $30 million swing from operations. Could you just clarify that, please? Carol L. Roberts: Yes, Chip, I think what I called out was 22 on total outage expense from first to second. Chip Dillon : Okay. Carol L. Roberts: So, I'm not sure where the number that you said. What we did called out is Riegelwood was a big driver, but if you added all up, if you go all the way across the line there and add it all up, it's a $22 million improvement first to second. Chip Dillon : Got you, okay. Carol L. Roberts: And the second part of your question, I'm not sure, I the second part of your question then still has application. Chip Dillon : Yes, the operations, I think you said there were some $30 million benefit from just operations that you referred to. Carol L. Roberts: Yes, the second quarter is always a better operations quarter than the first, it\u2019s not as cold, we just we have lot behind you, generally a good operational quarter for lots of reasons and we anticipate that to happen. Chip Dillon : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned, I think this is very apropos, given the opportunity in Madrid, and you say you have a lot of exposure in the fruit, vegetable area. My understanding is that most or all of the fruits and vegetables need to be packaged in virgin-based craft liner because of the condensation issue. And has technology changed to allow certain types of recycled board to be introduced there? Is there any kind of a change that has taken place or is taking place? And then is that, in part, behind your move in Madrid? Mark S. Sutton: No the move in Madrid is really to complement what we do with craft liner and your assessment is accurate. I mean there has been lots of attempts to make products with mixed substrate in that field, it really, really is driven by the supply chain, there are probably some short supply chains that care different products. But the humidity from the harvest, all the way through the supply chain to the market, is what drives the performance characteristics of fresh food packaging for meeting craft liner or craft like performance characteristics. The industrial business, the high end industrial business that complements your mix in your plant, because obviously agriculture seasonally, and you want to run your plant and run a successful business over the year. That's where the high performance lightweight recycled comes in and it allows us to perform better in some of the best industrial segment versus using board that is not that high performance, it\u2019s got to use more of it and things with that nature. We end up not being competitive in the industrial segment that you really want to be in. Chip Dillon : That makes lot of sense. Thanks very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Danny Moran of Macquarie. Danny Moran : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to clarify something on your heat map that you provided in your earnings presentation. Do you anticipate continued higher year-over-year export shipments in 2Q and for the year? And then do you also expect further price erosion to the export markets? W. Michael Amick : Hi, Dan, I'm assuming you are talking about container board. Yes, I mean we feel pretty good about the demand signal that we've gotten from the market, margins take a hit, demands seems to be holding up, which that to us, there is a need for the type of product that we're supplying to the export markets and we've been a strategic supplier to those markets for decade. So we have long-term relationship that we stick with quarter-to-quarter, year-in, year-out. We feel pretty good about our backlog for the second quarter, the market is very competitive, I don't want to forecast price, but I just leave that it's competitive and the types of erosion that we've seen probably continue into the quarter. So we'll manage it accordingly, but we still make decent money on export and we like it a lot on average through the cycle. Danny Moran : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then one last one from me. With all the moving parts in your North American Industrial Packaging business, with economic downtime and some capacity creep, on a net basis do you expect to produce more or less boxes this year? W. Michael Amick : Well, I'm not going to forecast what we will produce, we've said that overtime our goal is that we position ourselves with the right segments and with the right customers and we would expect to perform in line with market as our choices around customer mix grow overtime. And we\u2019ve seen a little bit of both here over the past year, last year we were underperforming because of some of that exposure and in the first quarter of this year we were right on top of it. So to us it\u2019s about customer choices and how we align ourselves in the right spots. Danny Moran : Got it. Okay. Thanks and good luck for the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over o Jay Royalty for any closing remarks. Jay Royalty : Sorry Brandy I was jumping on a little. Well that\u2019s all the time we had today folks. Thanks for joining and as always, Mitchell and I are available after the call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Davidson Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital Operator : Good morning, I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Royalty : Thank you. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining international Paper's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2016 earnings, press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint ventures, financial information and statistical measures.  With that I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call and Thank you for your interest in International Paper. I'm going to start on Slide 5. International Paper delivered a strong second quarter with solid contributions from our key businesses across our enterprise, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.6% which is 50 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $527 million. Operations performed well and a heavy quarter of maintenance outages was executed very effectively. The recently converted machine at the Riegelwood mill is running well and on schedule with our expectations. On the portfolio front, we completed the sale of the Asia box business and closed on the purchase of the Madrid mill. We have an agreement with Holmen to produce newsprint which they will sell until we start the recycle container work conversion in mid-2017. We expect the converted mill to be up and running in the fourth quarter of 2017. And in early May, we announced that we reached an agreement with Weyerhaeuser to buy their pulp business and we expect to close on that transaction in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to reported that we successfully completed the lump sum buyout program for our term vested employees in the IP pension plan which we initiated to further derisk the plan, consistent with our balance sheet strategy. Finally, Ilim joint venture delivered another solid quarter of performance and International Paper received a $58 million dividend in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6 and speaking a little more specifically to the financial results for the quarter. Revenue was down year over year, primarily due to the sale of the Sun joint venture in China and the sale of our Carolina brand of coated bristols last year. EPS of $0.92 represented strong performance coming off a solid first quarter. And as you can see in the chart on the right, return on invested capital for the first half of 2016 was solidly above our cost of capital at 10.6%. This is an important metric that we watch very closely because it's a good indicator of whether IP is creating value for our shareholders over time. When we run our businesses well and when we deploy capital in a value-creating way, we see this metric improve. We've had six consecutive years above our cost of capital and we've been on an upward improvement trend for several years. All in all, I am pleased with our performance in the quarter and the first half of 2016. With that introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Carol Roberts to cover the business highlights and the outlook for the third quarter. Carol Roberts : Thanks, Mark. Good morning. As Mark mentioned, IP delivered a strong quarter at $0.92 EPS, driven by seasonably stronger volume and good operational performance. Prices were lower, as expected and I will put some color on this as we get into the various business segments. We successfully executed a heavy outage quarter that was slightly lower than the first quarter due to less downtime from the mill conversion process at Riegelwood. And results for the Ilim JV were slightly lower than the first quarter, mainly due to planned maintenance outages in the quarter and some modest cost inflation. Turning to the business segment and beginning with industrial packaging, the business had another strong quarter, driven by seasonably stronger volume, good operational performance and some benefit from input cost. These were partially offset by lower containerboard export prices and lower box prices, due to the impact of the January Container Board Index change, Contract renewals and a slightly favorable -- less favorable mix. Maintenance outage expenses were higher as well. The North American system took 85,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter to match our supply with our demand. Turning to Slide 9, I want to highlight some of the key levers we have within IP's North American Industrial Packaging business that enable us to build upon what is already a great business and make it even better. Our sales teams and designers are working with our customers every day to redesign packaging, leverage innovation and find ways to take cost out,. IP has a low-cost, world-class mill system, along with a vast box and specialty plant footprint with a diverse range of capability. And that footprint serves thousands of customers across every consumer segment. We're always working to improve our portfolio of business and grow with the highest value customers and we have a portfolio of customers and product second to none in the industry. On the manufacturing and supply chain front, our teams are using the most advanced tools and techniques to drive efficiency improvement and cost reduction. And this of course, positively impacts our margin. As Mark mentioned, we're committed discipline and targeted capital investment program, in the right places to maintain and improve this world-class system. For example, over the last few years, we have implemented a couple hundred million dollars of cost reduction projects in the areas of consumption reduction that have IRRs greater than 25%. We continue to have a robust pipeline of these types of opportunities across our broad network. As I said, lots of levers that have contributed to our success and will continue to do so as we move forward. Slide 10, moving now to consumer packaging, the business experienced a much improved quarter, driven by good operation, effective cost management and the lack of maintenance outages. Prices were slightly lower on folding carton and plate stock but this was fully offset by a more favorable mix. Within this segment, our Foods Service business benefited from increased volume as we moved through the summer cold cup season. In printing papers, earnings improved due to lower outage costs associated with the Riegelwood mill conversion, partly offset by a less favorable product mix and lower pulp prices. The negative $11 million in the price mix bucket is fully attributable to the less favorable mix associated with the ramp-up in qualification of the newly converted machine in Riegelwood. Paper volume was higher in Europe and Brazil and it is also worth noting that the significantly lower outage expense in pulp was partially offset by higher planned maintenance outage expense across the remaining paper business. Turning now to Ilim, the JV turned in another solid quarter of performance with volumes up almost 5% year over year. The JV had planned maintenance outages at two of the mills which negatively impacted earnings. FX was generally stable throughout the quarter and as Mark mentioned, IP received a dividend of $58 million during the quarter. The outlook for IP equity earnings for the third quarter is generally in line with the quarter just completed. But I would note that there was a positive gain of $0.01 on FX related to the JV's U.S. denominated debt in the second quarter that we assume will not repeat in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 13, before I move on to the outlook, I would like to give an update on actions we've taken or are planning to take around continued prudent management of IP's pension plan. As we previously disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q, we offered a voluntary pension buyout for term vested former employees. We completed the program and made the associated payments in the second quarter. We paid a total of $1.2 billion to approximately 25,000 former employees out of plan assets, settling the corresponding liability in keeping with our strategy to take risks off the table. A requirement of settling a liability of this magnitude resulted in IP taking a non-cash settlement charge of $439 million or $270 million after-tax for unamortized actuarial losses which impacted our non- operating pension expense for the quarter. Additionally, we elected to make a voluntary contribution of $250 million to the plan in the second quarter. And we plan to make additional contributions of $500 million by the end of the year. Based on our analysis, we believe these contributions make good sense in light of the tax benefits as well as the fee savings and is consistent with our strategy of derisking the plan over time and managing our balance sheet. So, on Slide 14 moving to the third quarter outlook, volume is expected to be mostly stable across the businesses, with the exception of EMEA packaging which will be lower due to normal seasonality in Morocco. Price for the quarter is expected to be lower in North American industrial packaging due to the flow-through effect of the January PPW Index change. This will negatively affect earnings by about $10 million. To a slightly lesser extent, earnings are expected to also be impacted by a less favorable mix in the pulp business as the majority of the tons coming off the new capacity at Riegelwood during ramp-up will be market softwood rolls. All other pricing should be largely stable. Operations are expected to continue to perform well and input costs, particularly energy and OCC in North America are expected to be higher in the third quarter by roughly $35 million. Maintenance outage expenses are forecasted to be lower by about $60 million. IP equity earnings from the Ilim JV are expected to be relatively flat, assuming a stable FX. With this assumption, there would be a non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 gain from FX on the JV's U.S. denominated debt in the prior quarter. And as you can see there are a few other minor items noted on the chart. I would also note that several of the trends we're seeing, as we move into the third quarter, such as input costs are likely to impact the fourth quarter as well. So with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Carol, so before I wrap things up, I wanted to take a moment to touch on the strategic opportunity we announced during the quarter that IP has reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Weyerhaeuser for the pulp business. When we complete the transaction, International Paper will be a premier global producer of fluff pulp, with a strong position in North America and the ability to serve growing global markets. This strategic combination will also provide us with a talented team and superior research and development capabilities, including a valuable patent portfolio that will enable IP to better serve customers and make our combined businesses more competitive and more profitable. The valuation around the acquisition is very compelling and offers an attractive all-in multiple, along with solid double-digit financial returns through real and significant synergies and low integration risk. Again, we're very pleased with this acquisition and the integration opportunity ahead of us and look forward to strengthening this business and the rest of International Paper. Moving to Slide 16, I want to briefly come back to the bigger picture for International Paper as we've evolved over the last 18 months or so. Our strategy is to produce fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper where we have advantage production positions and we serve advantaged markets. When we choose the right products, make them in the right places and serve the right markets and the right customers and when we execute very effectively, we generate the greatest value for our customers and our shareholders. Looking at the recent decisions we've made, I believe our actions in Asia, the improvement in our North American Industrial Packaging business, the investment in European packaging and the opportunity of our Riegelwood Mill conversion and the purchase of Weyerhaeuser's fluff pulp businesses are all consistent with this strategy. So, in closing, I am encouraged how, by how International Paper continues to consistently perform in a challenging and changing global environment. Our focus is squarely on execution, from working closely with our customers to deliver superior value to running and improving our operations, to driving cost out of our system and supply chain, all to maintain and improve margins, as you've seen IP do over the last several years. Our financial discipline is evident from our constant vigilance to maintain a strong balance sheet through the rigorous capital allocation. We're committed to strengthening our portfolio businesses and to increase the value of the Company and ensure an attractive future for IP and our shareholders. Finally, we remain intensely focused on strong free cash flow generation and delivering returns well above our cost of capital to drive shareholder value. With that, I would like to turn it back over to the operator and open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Manuel : Carol, I just wanted to kind of come back to the pension item, if I could, for one second. I mean, as you now have this done, it looks like as a chunk that might go out this year, what might we -- how should we think about pension expense for IP, as I think you've got $360 million-ish or so running through this year, how might that change next year in 2017 both for expense and then cash out, et cetera, requirements? Carol Roberts : So, a good question, Chris, so just one comment, relative to what will flow through the P&L next year from a service cost, I don't anticipate any big change relative to the service course. Of course, that goes through the P&L, as you would expect, again, on the non-operating pension expense, that moves around a bit. I would say directionally, given that we have settled out this current liability related to the buyout, in theory, it should go down some due to that but we won't know until we see how the end of the year comes, how interest rates come out and all the things that goes into that equation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Philip Ng : You guys had a very strong quarter on the operations front on consumer, can you give a little more color on that improvement? Is that stable going forward? Mike Amick : The operating cost associated with consumer was strong on a number of fronts. We had really good operations. We believe that is sustainable. Part of the cost picture was also the -- not having the Augusta outage which occurred in the first quarter. We don't have any outages in the third quarter as well, so we feel exceptionally confident about our runnability and our performance moving forward. The other thing I would add to this is we have made some pretty good headwinds around our supply chain cost and our cost to serve as well. So I am very encouraged about that in the context of certainly the quarter and our outlook. Philip Ng : Okay and I guess switching gears a little bit onto your printing paper business. If I look at your heat map chart, it is citing flattish price or a stable price? I would have thought with the increases in the marketplace, you would have seen an uptick. Is some of that being offset by lower pulp prices? Thanks. Mike Amick : You're referring to the page in the Appendix. Again, this is Mike Amick. Overall, prices are going up in papers and we expect that to continue to happen, as you can expect and would appreciate, mix comes into this thing, freight lines come into this thing from a transaction price standpoint. But overall, our paper prices are moving up. It could be -- it's just a factor of timing, a lot of times, more than anything else, Philip. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : So just first -- actually one follow-up on the paper pricing. So is it reasonable to anticipate that, in the fourth quarter which actually typically though we see something weak for pricing in paper but should we see that the lagged impact and see better pricing in the fourth quarter, assuming no change in the marketplace from where things have trended? And then, additionally, if we could get some more color on what you're seeing in the Industrial Packaging business, an update on market conditions with some reasonably favorable data as of late? Mike Amick : So Mark, this is Mike again, so to make sure I answered your question, the lack -- you were breaking up a little bit. The lack of what? Which? Mark Weintraub : Basically, should we be anticipating that the prices would be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter due to the lagged impact of price increases going through? Mike Amick : Well, what we're not going to do is really forecast on pricing, as we shared with you in the last call, this is going to be, more or less, a second-half event. We will -- do expect to see prices to move as we kind of move forward. Where we settle out on the fourth quarter, there is still a fair amount of water under the bridge to pass there, so let's stay tuned for that as we report out on for -- the fourth quarter, okay? Mark Weintraub : Sure. Timothy Nicholls : Market conditions, so far, I think are roughly in line with what we expected, through the first half, of the year on box. A little bit uneven from month to month, but overall, pretty much what we expected and I think we continue to look at 1% to 1.5% growth for the full year. So, I think in line with how we were thinking about it. On the export side, demand continues to be good for craft liner. Markets seemed like they started to firm as we went through the second quarter so we will have to see how that plays out, but on balance, it feels as expected and pretty stable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : I had a couple of questions, maybe first seguewaying a little bit off of Mark's question. So, should we assume that if the outlook is 1% to 1.5% in growth for industrial that, that is what you've been seeing early in the third quarter, Tim? And have you seen any effect at all from Brexit in terms of customer expectations in Europe or even relative to the U.S.? Again, it would appear that we haven't but just wanted to ask that for the record. Timothy Nicholls : Yes, so far, third quarter looks like it's playing out pretty much as we expected. In terms of Brexit, I will just speak for a containerboard, because there is a whole European business apart from what we do here in North America. But we have a very small position in the UK, so from a containerboard export standpoint, we don't expect any significant impact at all. Mark Sutton : For the Company as a whole, the first order of effect is the Brexit action is pretty minor, given our market positions there. We really don't make any products in the UK. We do serve the market. Second order, I think everybody is still trying to figure that out. George Staphos : My question is probably more on the second order than on the first order but I understand why there would be a little bit of lack of clarity at this juncture. Two other questions and then I will turn it over. Carol, can you talk a little bit -- or Tim, can you talk a little bit about what additional cost reduction opportunities you might have? What other leverage you might have to optimizing the mills? I think the number that's been cited in the past and again, on this call was around $200 million.  And as you ultimately achieve that, as you look out another couple of years, does it get harder to get increased in improvement -- performance improvements at that level, given that you're already so low on the cost curve? That's question number one and then question number two, just a quickie, can you update us all on any things to be mindful of in terms of the progress and the process with the Weyerhaeuser closing? Thank you. Timothy Nicholls : I'll just take the first part and Carol can jump in, but I will take the first part of the question around cost optimization. We feel like it's a pretty rich environment. When you've got such a large system, we move, on average, 200,000 tons a week from our mills to our box plants. So, a lot of productive capacity, a lot of supply chain. We've got people working in all of those spaces, looking for value creation, waste elimination-type opportunities, so is it easy? No, it is not easy. We worked pretty hard at it, but I think it's a pretty rich environment for us. Mike Amick : George, on Weyerhaeuser, as you know, we're going to the regulatory approval process. We've done this a couple of times in the recent past. In our experience, would say things are going as you would expect them to go. We still expect to close in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Year-to-date, we've seen a really large number of acquisitions of independent box plants by some of your competitors. And I was wondering if you could just talk, maybe generally about how that's changed the commercial environment or if it's changed the commercial environment or has it impacted, the ton you sell into the open market? Or have you had to shift your board sales around? Just wondering if you could speak to that. And then in terms of your own integration rate, can you remind us, do you have a target integration rate or a preferred method for growing on integration rate or any thoughts you could share would be helpful. Mark Sutton : Yes, let me start with the last and work backwards, on integration, we don't have a target. What we want to do is pick the right segments, pick the right customers and where we can deliver value proposition, take great positions and then grow with those customers over time and then it will be what it will be. We like our integrated channel. We like it here in North America. We also like it in the other parts of the world where we ship more to our converting businesses there. So we also like the two other channels that we participate in. In terms of the acquisitions, it hasn't impacted us directly. We haven't had to make any types of shifts and I don't think it -- from my standpoint, it's one opinion but I don't think it has yet had any material impact on the size of the independent market or it's very fragmented. There is a lot of players in that space. So we haven't seen any direct impact caused by acquisitions over the past few years at this point. Anthony Pettinari : And then just a follow-up, you do have a decent sized presence in Turkey, given the events there. Have you seen any disruption to your shipments or your people there? And are you taking any steps to manage risk into the second half? Mark Sutton : So, specifically to the events of the past couple of weeks, no, we have not seen any major impact. I think you look at that region of the world and Turkey, because of just where it is located approximate to some of the unrest, we've seen demand -- economy underperform and some diminishment of demand. But overall, it is a very good market for us. We believe in it long term and we manage day-to-day to balance out the risks that we have. But we've still got a sizable presence there and like it very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : The question I have the first one is on the maintenance situation. It looks like you guys are I guess doing better than you thought you would. If I go back about six months, it looks like your expense was scheduled to be around $534 million for the year. And then in April, that fell to $508 million and now it's down to $462 million for the year. And I didn't know if that was more of a function of deferring or were you finding better ways to do what you'd normally do? Carol Roberts : Chip, this is Carol and I will take a shot at that. I think it is both. I think we always look to find better and smarter ways to execute outages. I think we're also making choices about what works, do we need to do, do we have some headwinds against our expectations for the year. So Mark has challenged the organization pretty hard about what are some of the options we have. And then we have got a very large global footprint so one mill is -- we don't break it out at the level of detail but there is some work that we have been able to push into the next year with extending outage cycles. So it's all of the above and the main story here is it continues to be an important part of the work we do, vital to our running well, but we're going to spend our dollars very, very wisely. And so I think that's what you're seeing and we'll try to continue to provide the transparency such that you can see how that evolves through time. Mark Sutton : Chip, I would just add on top of that, it is a strategy for us to get better in this area. So each year, we deploy more predictive tools than we did the year before. And that leads us to making different decisions in where we spend money and what we have to repair versus what we thought we had to repair. And we will continue to get better at that, there is a lot of technology and techniques, precision maintenance techniques and predictive tools that help you work on just what needs to be worked on. And we're getting better at that every year. Chip Dillon : Okay, good. And one other question, is when I look at the balance sheet, the pension number has risen from about $3.5 billion to a little over $4 billion and I would assume that includes the impact of what you just settled and the $250 million. And so I guess my question is, when we include the $500 million you're going to put in the second half. And if we were to assume rates stay about where they are, would that be a fair number to see on the balance sheet or close to a fair number we should expect to see at the yearend again, assuming no change in rates from here? Carol Roberts : Yes, Chip and the one clarification which I think I stated but if I didn't, I want to be clear, with this program that we did, it did require a remeasurement of the plan which normally we wouldn't be doing at the end of June. We would remeasure the plan at the end of the year, so the liability that shows on the balance sheet has been impacted by the very low interest rates that hit at the end of the June which was a combination of all kinds of things going on the globe. So a couple of things will happen, one is we will have a half of year of asset performance. We'll have the contributions that go in and we will also remeasure the plan, depending upon how interest rates move from June 30 for International Paper to the end of the year. So, yes, you are thinking about it correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : A call earlier this week, I think one of your competitors, was asked about the ability to get permitting for craft mill capacity in the U.S. and suggested they didn't think it was really possible or more difficult. I was wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on that because I think it's important, not only for the fluff pulp business, but also longer term craft containerboard mill assets in the U.S.. I think the conventional wisdom has been that, that was impossible. Mike Amick : Debbie, I think we haven't tried to permit a new pulp mill in awhile in the U.S. so we can't speak from actual experience recently, but we think, just based on some of the things we know about existing mills and the way that you have to operate wood pulping operations, it's a pretty difficult process to imagine happening. Debbie Jones : And then my follow-up question, just we haven't talked about D&A or CapEx that much on the call. Is the $1.3 billion still a good number for the year for each? Carol Roberts : Debbie, this is Carol, I think the number is probably trending closer to $1.25 billion and that is a combination of a couple of things. One is we're on unit of operation, so as we run our North American containerboard system, we -- people can -- you can see our utilization of those assets has impacted it. So it has come down a little bit from our original expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Just a question on synergies with the prospective purchase of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business, just noting that whereas you got the $28 million in cost savings in 2014, $47 million; in 2015, they were targeting $40 million; to $50 million in 2016 so that totals $120 million and you are expecting $175 million. So I'm just wondering where that $175 million, where the major buckets are and is there that much synergy left in the business? Mark Sutton : I think the $175 million we feel really good about and it's in the categories that we have demonstrated when you put two really good businesses together, you can find it. SO some of it's obviously an overhead, but sourcing and how we buy all the inputs and get synergies there. And big one for this business is supply chain, in bound supply chain, outbound supply chain and probably most importantly, making the right products at the right facility. So that your total cost to serve is the lowest and your total manufacturing cost is the lowest. There's other optimization opportunities but that's really the buckets that will drive the synergies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research. Gail Glazerman : I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color on fiber cost, both wood and OCC? So your wood costs have been coming down pretty nicely. You seem to be at a couple-year low; is that a trend you would expect to continue and just any thoughts on what has been driving the recent uptick in OCC and do you expect that to continue? Carol Roberts : I'm going to comment on the wood and then I think I will probably let Tim comment on the OCC. The wood is a combination of effects. It's --have been -- I think we would have described it in years past as stubbornly high which it was above historic levels. For us, it has come down and that's been a combination of weather, of strategy, of inventories, of a lot of things that are going on. So we're pleased to see that. And we're hoping that the current level of wood cost will continue. We've got some concerns about other input headwinds and wood, quite honestly, is not one of the ones that we're anticipating, so a pretty good story on wood and then I will let Tim comment on the OCC. Timothy Nicholls : I would just say more of a pull from China which is having some impact. You've seen prices in China go up over the past couple of months. Maybe because there is a little bit less generation of locally-sourced OCC in country, but I think this is what we expect, a normal type of variation around OCC pricing as we go through the year. It's going to up; it's going to go down based on generation and usage. Our long term view is that it will continue to rise over time, but I think this is just a normal seasonal type of variation that we're experiencing at the moment. Gail Glazerman : And just on consumer board, we're I guess four to five months into the start of the MESA board project, been only a week or two into the start of the Kaukau mills but I'm just wondering if you could give some perspective, particularly given your position in the European market, how -- where that board is going and how it is impacting the markets, if at all in any global region? Mike Amick : I can start here, we know that from an import standpoint, that we've seen imports in North America up, let's call it roughly 10% to 12%. That is off of a fairly smaller base so it amounts to about 20,000 tons and we know that some of the product is here. We haven't seen it at an appreciable level right now, so from a significant standpoint, at least at this state, nothing significant in North America. Mark Sutton : Gail, I think in the European context, we redesigned our product offering out of our Kwidzyn mill and it's a real specialty, high-end, high-yield board and so the customers we have in the segments we play in, we haven't seen any disruption. I do think that board you mentioned is finding its way into some of the market, but not exactly in the spot that we're. Gail Glazerman : Okay and just on that, any sense that it's causing a repatriation of exports domestically? Is it fine for global markets? Mark Sutton : Directly, we've certainly seen some, as you see published, a drop in exports here in North America, particularly around SBS but attributing that to a specific event is a little bit, would be a little bit challenging to do at this stage. Mike Amick : I don't think we've had a personal experience with our export customers and have made -- closing a position to that particular product, but could it be happening more broadly? I think we'll figure that out, but we haven't had that exact experience. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Mark Connelly : First question is on consumer, that business has now been cut back with Sun and all that and it's now at a point where the business looks pretty good and attractive but the scale is small enough that we're starting to wonder what its significance is. Do you see enough opportunities to grow that business over the next couple of years, whether it is internal spend or M&A, consistent with the strategy that you've laid out? And if you do, is that going to be more likely in the U.S. or elsewhere? Mark Sutton : The consumer business is still an important business and you think about that strategic framework around fiber-based packaging. It fits squarely in there and we have a niche business, that's no doubt. SBS on the board side and one type of converting but we also have in Europe, a very good, also niche, high-end FBB business. When you take them all together, our challenge internally is to figure out the ways that we can create value by improving those business and/or growing, but when you put the two together and you look at the size of International Paper, they are not insignificant in the size of our Company. The ways to improve -- there are the ways you would imagine, should we make more converting? Should we offer other substrates? That is constantly in our strategic evaluation. And I wouldn't necessarily comment on whether we would do more or do less or more in another part of the world, but the U.S. business and the consumer behavior for these types of products is pretty strong. Mark Connelly : And the second question, I was happy to see that you highlighted the higher-value pulps beyond fluff that you're going to have in your portfolio. Those have not gotten a lot of attention and of course, IP has some historical experience there. Is that an opportunity, do you expect to try to expand now that you've got this nicer, deeper portfolio? Mark Sutton : I think, the way to create value in a specialty fibers business is obviously to continue to trade up to the higher value, whatever the product is doing for the customer and some of those higher value pulps provide a tremendous technical value or service. And so, we will have and to the question I got on synergies, we will have enough capacity with the two systems together to really optimize and make more of those higher-value products as the customers that we have need them. So we're excited about that and we will continue, like we do in a number of our other businesses, start with a product mix and a customer mix and work to improve that over time, with more of the higher value mix in the portfolio than when we started. Operator : Adam Josephson from KeyBanc, your line is open. Adam Josephson : Tim, just one on your containerboard inventories exiting the second quarter. How would you characterize -- Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Yes, I'm here. Adam Josephson : Sorry about that. Do you expect further reductions over the balance of the year or do you think you've sufficiently right-sized your inventories, if you will, to reflect the current freight and logistics situation? Timothy Nicholls : I think we made a lot of progress. We were down in the quarter again and look, we try to run a lean supply chain to begin with, so we're managing it real-time, day to day, week to week. And we're making adjustments as we need to. As I mentioned earlier, we moved roughly 200,000 tons a week in board out to our system, so I think we came in lower in the second quarter. I think we have adjusted to supply chain. For the moment, we will have to see what happens. The thing about supply chain is, it doesn't stay static. If you talk to the rails -- the rail companies or their parking cars and trying to make adjustments and so, I think we're nimble enough that hopefully, we see those changes coming soon enough and we react ahead of time. Adam Josephson : And Carol, just two quick one's for you, just on the EBIT bridge that you talked about. You've got the $60 million lower maintenance but you have the $35 million or so higher input costs and then $15 million or so of lower price mix In North America. Are those the big buckets that you would point us to, just to be clear? Carol Roberts : Yes, Adam, I think those are the big movers and the big buckets. And I think the one for the second half that will be interesting to see how it plays out is going to be those input costs. Clearly, the outages are pretty clear and some of the commentary we gave around prices, things that we have the line of sight to. So we'll have to see how the input cost evolves over this second half of the year. Adam Josephson : And just one last one on pension. So after the $500 million of contributions in the second half and given whatever you expect asset returns to be, what do you expect your pension gap to be at year end? And will these contributions that you're making have any impact on your share repurchases? Thanks very much. Carol Roberts : So, on the pension, I think you can think about the contribution into the pension should definitely contribute toward closing the gap. The big unknowns will be really discount rates and interest rates and I've got to think they should only go up from where they were on June 30 and then asset returns, so it would be hard to speculate on those things but clearly, the $500 million should be helpful. And your second part of your question, Adam? Adam Josephson : Carol, just given the pending acquisition of the fluff pulp business and given the pension contributions you're making, will that have any bearing on your stock repurchases, either this year or next year? Carol Roberts : Yes, so, we remain committed to the buyback and as we all know, we have probably a little less than 1 billion left, that said, we've always said that if there were opportunities for reinvestment into the business to create value, that they -- those would be important priorities and with the size and scale of the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, getting the funds to take care of that and addressing our debt profile will probably be our highest priority in the next year or so. So then you could draw a conclusion about what does that mean for the buyback? I think it will depend very much on how things progress, the business conditions we see. I feel very good about our ability to continue to generate very strong free cash flow, so we will have to see how that manifests and unfolds over the next 12 to 24 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from DA Davidson. Steve Chercover : So my first question is on free sheet, it doesn't appear that you had any impact from the price hike but I'm wondering if that is a function of mix and should we expect any benefit in the second half of the year? Mike Amick : Price has been and will continue to move up, there is some impact, as you rightly stated. It centers around mix; it's also timing and so forth. But we do expect to see prices continue to go up. Steve Chercover : And then secondly, it was kind of a weird press release from the FERC, indicating that you had regulatory approval for the Weyerhaeuser assets. So I'm, A, I don't even know if that was real, but if it is, is that a good precedent for the DOJ process? Mark Sutton : That is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have gotten that approval, but that is a different process than the DOJ process. It's one -- when we say we're under regulatory approvals, that is one of the regulatory approvals. Everybody focuses on the DOJ but there are more than just the Department of Justice. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wondered, to start off, if we could talk a little bit about what you're doing on both sides of the business down in Brazil right now to improve performance? Mark Sutton : So, Mark, I will start on the packaging side which is the business that's challenged because of the exposure to the Brazil economy. As I said the last couple of calls, what we're trying to do with that business is improve it from a cost profile standpoint and redesigning the way we're organize from a people standpoint and redesigning the way that we make and supply the containerboard to our box plants. And then, be as strong as we can and perform where we think we can perform in a positive economy versus a minus 4%. That business has the potential to perform much better at a plus 4% and being able to cover inflation with some degree of pricing versus a minus 4% market and being behind the inflation wheel. So what we're trying to do is change the cost structure, make sure we continue to focus on the customers we have, even though everybody in almost every segment is hurting right now and be well-positioned when Brazil's economy begins to pick up. That is what we can control and we're being very careful with any investments and really trying to do, what I would say, is fundamental basic blocking and tackling on the commercial side And on the operational side. On the paper business, we continue to perform very well in that business. Part of it is because it fits squarely into being, if you're going to make uncoated free sheet and be a global provider. That is the place to make it and it starts with the fiber cost structure and our fiber availability. So given our export position and given the fact that the paper market in Brazil hasn't been hit as much as some of the consumer product markets that hit the box business, we're continuing to perform well and it is part of the same story, is getting our cost even lower and making sure that we go the extra mile to take care of our customers, both in Brazil and outside of Brazil. And we still have some of the strongest EBITDA margins in all of IP in our Brazil paper business. Mark Wilde : Just on those margins, Mark, one time when Champion had that, those margins would be in the 35% to 40% range. Is there any prospect of those returning, do you think? Mark Sutton : I think if you take the recent past, we've been in the mid-30%s on several quarterly reports and if you look at the FX impact that has occurred over the last couple of quarters, if you just strip that out which you can't, but if you did, you would back into the low 30%s. It is a 30%-plus EBITDA margin business over time. Mark Wilde : Okay, all right. And then I just had a follow-on for Tim Nicholls. Tim, you've taken a little over 600,000 tons of economic downtime in containerboard in the last four quarters. Should we think about IP going forward as just being willing to carry that much flex in the system? Timothy Nicholls : I don't want to quantify and said there's going to be X number of tons but there is going to be some amount of system flex that we actually need. We're managing a system that is huge and just normal seasonality. The way we run our supply chain and the way we try to service customers and our businesses, we believe that we're better off flexing over time than trying to cover it with positioning inventory. You always get it wrong. So we will have some amount of downtime every year as we go through the year just balancing out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Carol, just another question on the pension and then I hate to harp on it but the issue is if you look at the last three years, you've had to put $1.8 billion of cash into the pension which is -- looks like about a third of the free cash flow over the period. So I guess as we move into 2017 and then really based on the interest rates today, do you plan any more cash contributions over the next three years, let's say? Carol Roberts : Yes, Scott and just a qualifier on what you said is, the contributions we made, while real, were essentially voluntary. Voluntary meaning as we look at our balance sheet, as we think about where to take the cash to manage our debt, we have looked at the economics around the pension and said that is not a bad place to go with some excess cash right now. Part of it's the tax advantage way of doing it.  The other thing we always consider is we're always looking out and thinking about will we have a regret factor long term and we never want to have too much where we put money and then we say, why did we do that? So it's a balancing act based upon options. So I think what you're seeing us do is right now, this is what makes sense for us given the point we're relative to our overall debt profile. And there will be no required contributions out until 2019 and even 2019 is a very -- pretty, very small number, so that gives us choices and we will continue to make the choices around all those variables that we think meets our needs the best. Scott Gaffner : Okay and is the comment on no cash contributions tile 2019 based on the year-end 2015 discount rates and expected rates of return or is it based on today's -- on the reevaluation that you were talking about? Carol Roberts : Well, remember, there's two ways you have to look at your pension, there is one for accounting and that's your pension benefit obligation, that is the balance sheet. And then there is the funding. The funding is impacted by other factors, considering just the policy out of Washington. Remember we talked a couple of years ago about MAP and how that was the acronym for the smoothing of interest rates, so we have very good line of sight on the required contributions, based upon those things and they are smoothed out. So we know pretty certainly where that is. Now what we don't know is that accounting piece that hits at the end of the year which comes from discount rate -- remember 100 basis points for us is about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion Delta in that liability. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And then Mark, if I look at return on invested capital year to date, 10.6% which is in line with the first half of last year and for the full year 2015, you had the records, 11% return on invested capital, so is there anything in the second half and you hit those numbers despite some headwinds in the first half of the year. Is there anything in the second half that would preclude you from getting back to that 11% return on invested capital in 2016? Mark Sutton : Well, I think the one new thing we have is the Weyerhaeuser acquisition which we think will close in the fourth quarter and that will have a temporary effect, as we bring that debt on and we will see it go back up. But what's important, Scott, is we think about the return on invested capital over a long period of time and we think about it in bands. So the first band is get it to your cost of capital. We've demonstrated we can do that and then we look at two -- as I mentioned before, 200 or 300 basis points above our cost of capital and finding a way to settle in that band. And then the question is always, do you create more value by making your enterprise a larger enterprise at that return or do you create more value by raising that return even further? And, there is analytical approaches to that, that back up the solid business case, so the point number is a blood pressure check, but over time, we want to be in that zone where we have a couple of hundred or more basis points between our 8% cost of capital and our actual returns. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Manuel : I wanted to come back to some of the Weyerhaeuser assets in the fluff pulp, some of the different pieces there. Once you put this all together, can you talk about your ability to flex between making fluff pulp when you want to but some of the other grades, whether it's SBSK, et cetera. What you view -- I think we all know what long term demand looks like for fluff but perhaps maybe what some of the other end markets are? What you think long term demand looks like there and your ability to toggle back and forth? Mark Sutton : Well, Chris, we obviously haven't been able to do any detailed integration work, but when you look at our system and we look at what we can publicly get available on the assets and the products that Weyerhaeuser makes and we will have, as I mentioned early, enough capacity to really optimize the production, but the real focus in this business for us is the higher value-added specialty fibers, starting with fluff and moving up. The rest of the pulp is important and you will always have to make some of it as you make transitions and we have really good customers for that pulp, but the focus is really from fluff, basic fluff, all the way up to the high-value added specialty fibers. And we will have on day one, when these businesses come together because we have invested in the business recently and Weyerhaeuser has invested in the business, but we will have the capacity we need to make the products we want to make for the foreseeable future. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Royalty for final remarks. Jay Royalty : Thanks, operator and thanks Mark and everyone for joining the call this morning. As always Michele and I will be available after the call and our numbers are on Slide 18 of the presentation. Operator : Have a great day. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Paper Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn it over to Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining International Paper's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures are available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2016 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. I'm going start on slide five. International Paper delivered an overall solid performance in the third quarter beginning with strong free cash flow of $575 million. Results in our North American Industrial Packaging business were significantly affected by rising input costs which negatively impacted earnings by $36 million quarter-over-quarter, along with a slightly less favorable mix and modest price erosion which squeezed our margins a bit. We announced, and are in the process of implementing, a domestic containerboard price increase as well as a corresponding U.S. box price increase. We continue to see improved market demand across both our North American box business and our global pulp business. We experienced strong operational performances across our North American, EMEA and Brazil papers business as well as continuing strong performance in our Ilim joint venture in Russia. Also during the quarter, our board of directors approved a 5% increase to our annual dividend in our October meeting moving into $1.85 per share. This marks the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase since we established our dividend policy in 2012 when the dividend was $1.05 per share. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our free cash flow and our commitment to return a meaningful portion of our cash generation to our shareholders. Relative to the portfolio, we continue to actively work toward being prepared to close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business in the fourth quarter. We received the European Union's approval last week, and we received Brazil's approval just this week. But we still await a few others that we hope to receive shortly. Also, we've made a decision not to pursue a potential expansion into containerboard in India. And as a consequence, we wrote off a modest investment we had made in land and engineering for a potential site. Continuing with our financial results on slide six, you can see the various key metrics in the table on the slide, and I'll remind you of just a couple of points. The year-over-year revenue decline is primarily due to the divestitures of our Sun joint venture and our box business in China as well as the sale of our Coated Bristols business in North America. As you can see on the slide, IP continues to deliver strong margins in varying economic conditions at 17.6% for the third quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol and return at the end to wrap up and move it to question-and-answers. Thank you. Carol? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the bridge from the second to third quarter, you can see that our EPS performance was generally flat. As Mark mentioned, we encountered meaningful input cost inflation in the quarter, primarily on OCC and natural gas. Additionally, we experienced a less favorable box mix along with modest price erosion, predominantly in our North American Industrial Packaging business. These items offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense of $0.10 as well as a lower tax rate in the quarter which was driven by our mix of earnings as well as some one-time discrete items. Moving to the businesses. Results in the Industrial Packaging segment were negatively impacted by rising input costs and less favorable mix, price erosion and some operational and cost issues, all of which were more than offset -- or more than offset the benefit of lower planned maintenance outage expense. Relative to price and mix, IP experienced a less favorable box mix in the third quarter. Additionally, box prices were down $5 per ton due to the flow-through from the January index change along with modest price erosion. And also worth noting, the average price for our containerboard exports was lower on average in the third quarter as prices stabilized around the exit rate from the second quarter. The negative impact of volume in the quarter was attributable to the seasonally lower volume in EMEA associated with our Moroccan box business. In operations and costs, we had a couple of isolated issues at two mills which have now been resolved. And we also absorbed extra costs in the quarter due to additional overtime that we incurred in our box system to satisfy increased demand. Turning to slide nine and continuing on the theme of increased demand, our box business saw a favorable demand trend throughout the quarter with volume up 1.2% year-over-year. The increased demand was driven by favorable trends across IP's key segments highlighted on the slide. We continue to see robust year-over-year growth in online retail and distribution which is a meaningful segment for our business. IP's customers within the processed food segment have leveled out and are showing some growth as consumer trends continue to shift to healthier product offering and our customers enhance their offering by providing new products to satisfy these needs. Increased production and consumption of beef and pork are driving growth in the protein segment and favorable weather and crop conditions have fueled strong demand in the produce segment. It is our view, at IP, that the improving box market we are seeing is not an anomaly. Even though GDP has been below expectations in 2016, the consumer segments within GDP have been some of the strongest. And at the end of the day, it's consumer activity that drives the majority of box demand. Turning to Consumer Packaging on slide 10, the segment delivered another solid performance coming off a robust second quarter. Price and mix were modestly impacted by a less favorable mix of folding to cup business along with some slight erosion. Operations performed well overall but were impacted by several minor cost items in the quarter, including FX in EMEA and other miscellaneous one-time items in the U.S. Moving to the Printing Papers segment, results across the global businesses were strong, partially offset by another transitional quarter for the pulp business. Papers had a strong operational quarter, particularly in North America. Overall results for the segment were negatively impacted by a strike and other downtime we experienced in India which unfavorably impacted results by about $5 million in the quarter. Relative to price and mix for North America, mix was slightly negative and pricing was flat to slightly positive. We experienced some lower prices in Europe and on our Latin American exports out of Brazil. Overall, pulp business results declined by $15 million quarter-over-quarter, almost half of which was attributable to higher outage costs in the third quarter. And finally, results were favorably impacted by $6 million due to FX benefits, mostly in Brazil. Turning to Ilim. The JV delivered another strong quarter with operational EBITDA of $168 million which translated to IP equity earnings of $46 million. Relatively stable FX throughout the quarter resulted in a slight favorable gain for the quarter. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally higher volume to be more than offset by seasonally higher wood costs for the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 13 and moving to an update on recent financing and capital allocation actions we've taken. Early in the third quarter, we completed a debt issuance of$2.3 billion to fund our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's pulp business as well as the voluntary pension contributions that we spoke about on our last call. Additionally, as Mark mentioned in the opening, earlier this month, IP's board of directors authorized an increase to company's annual dividend of 5% to $1.85 per share which marked the fifth consecutive annual increase to the dividend. This is another meaningful move consistent with our policy of keeping the dividend in the range of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow and speaks to our continued confidence in the sustainability of our cash generation as we look forward. Before I move to the outlook, let me recap how we continue to think about capital allocation. It starts with cash from operations, and we think about how we can best leverage every dollar. Beginning with capital spending, you've seen us be flexible in terms of how we think about capital, balancing the ongoing need to maintain a world-class fleet with the realities of the marketplace and what we choose to or can afford to spend in any given year. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of high return cost reduction projects that we fund at an appropriate level on this basis. From there, we think about the need to utilize and maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet with appropriate leverage and credit rating to give us financial strength and flexibility over time. This includes the need to continue to proactively manage our pension plan as you've seen given the various moves we've made over the last several years. We are absolutely committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareowners as evidenced by the significant and consistent moves we've made to increase our dividend to a very meaningful level. Additionally, we've supplemented this cash to shareholders with opportunistic share repurchases. And we'll continue to thoughtfully utilize this option in the future. While we're doing all of this, we continue to look for select value-creating investment opportunities which fit our advantaged position and advantaged market strategy. These may come in the form of M&A, like the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition, or could be more modest bolt-on types of opportunities like the Madrid mill, Riegelwood and our projects within North American Industrial Packaging. Bottom line, we continue to feel that a relentless focus on strong cash generation and a balanced approach to capital allocation is the right strategy for IP to create long-term value for our shareholders. So moving to the fourth quarter outlook. I'll cover the details around the typical seasonal impacts that we see as we move from the third to the fourth quarter. But additionally, we have a couple of one-time non-recurring items that are expected to impact results for the quarter as well. So starting at the top. We expect daily demand to remain strong. However, volume will be lower due to four less shipping days in our North American corrugated packaging business. This is expected to negatively impact North American packaging business results by about $50 million. We expect seasonally stronger volume in the Brazil papers business, along with seasonal demand improvement in EMEA packaging. Relative to price and mix, due to the implementation of the North American containerboard and box price increases, we expect favorable impact in the fourth quarter to be about $20 million. Relative to the North American pulp business, we expect unfavorable impact of about $10 million as we continue to supply additional tons of softwood market pulp into less than favorable market conditions as we work towards qualifying and supplying more fluff pulp out of the new capacity at Riegelwood. Additionally, we expect to see benefits of recently announced and implemented price increases in Brazil papers in the quarter. Moving to operations and other. We experienced disruptions with Hurricane Matthew in October that unfavorably affected our North American businesses, where we have primary mills and significant business on the East Coast. In our North American papers and pulp business, this, along with other normal fourth quarter seasonal cost impacts, are expected to unfavorably impact results by $25 million. In our North American Industrial Packaging business, we will also see the impact of Hurricane Matthew on results. Additionally, we expect to incur a non-cash charge associated with inventory revaluation due to our LIFO accounting convention related to the North American containerboard price increase. These items are expected to unfavorably impact results by $35 million. So, as you think about the fourth quarter, the all-in impact of the one-time items I just covered above, including Hurricane Matthew and the non-cash inventory charge in North American Industrial Packaging, is roughly $45 million that will not repeat after the fourth quarter. Moving to input costs. On top of the impact we saw in the third quarter, we expect to see additional energy costs in North America as well as inflationary pressure on inputs in our EMEA business. We expect the unfavorable impact across our North American businesses to be about $12 million and about $6 million in Europe. Maintenance outage expenses are expected to increase slightly by $7 million. We expect Ilim results to be slightly less favorable due to lower operational EBITDA, along with the non-repeat of the favorable $0.01 FX impact from Q3. And finally, we do expect some modest impacts from the other items as we've noted at the bottom of the slide. So now let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Carol. In closing, International Paper continues to deliver solid performance in a global environment that presents plenty of challenges. As Carol mentioned, we remain highly focused on cash generation, and we're on track for another very strong year. We also remain focused on return on invested capital and are delivering another year of strong returns, solidly above 10%, which is well above our cost of capital. As I think about where we are, how we expect to finish the year and what next year looks like, we are seeing some near-term margin squeeze across many of our businesses as some price erosion has occurred while input costs have turned up. The good news is we continue to execute well and our margins remain strong overall. We also have some upside ahead, particularly in the North American Industrial Packaging business with the price increases which are underway. In addition to that, while market fundamentals for our global pulp business may remain challenged for a while, the Weyerhaeuser pulp acquisition provides real and significant synergy opportunities that we can begin to bring to bottom line as soon as we close the transaction. And while it's a bit further off due to the conversion, our newly acquired Madrid mill provides nice upside in earnings for our European box business. With our continued focus on cash generation and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, I remain confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful value for our shareholders. And with that, we'll open the floor for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just one real quick clarification. Did you say the impact from the four fewer days, the volume, et cetera, was that $50 million, you said, or $15 million? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Yes, Mark, this is Carol. It was 5-0, $50 million. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: 5-0 then. It sounds like a really big number for a little bit less for -- the impact from fewer days. Is this standard or is there something else going on here, would you say? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: It is standard. I think the four-day delta is probably what's wider than normal. I think if you look back, four days is a big delta. But if you look at the size of our system and the value of our shipments, that's the correct math, Mark. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe if you could provide a little bit more color, you were talking about another transitional quarter in the pulp business. I assume has a lot to do with Riegelwood. Can you explain to us where you are in that process? And how much in the way of costs you're entailing? And when you get to the other side of it, what type of opportunity exists? And I realize this gets complicated by the Weyerhaeuser acquisition also being in process. But if you can kind of isolate the -- what you were highlighting as the transitional quarter for the pulp business. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark, this is Mark. The third quarter was the first full quarter that we had operations on the converted machine. And I would say from our capital project planning and our ramp up plan, we're pretty much online. The transitional comment is really, as you know, when we think about fluff pulp, we have to qualify that with each and every customer. And that's what we're undergoing right now. So, in the interim, in order to run the machine and make the fluff trials, we make regular market softwood. And obviously pricing has been a little bit depressed. Demand is good. It's \u2013 global softwood's up 4%. But we're selling in \u2013 the market pulp into a lower price environment. So, as we get our specialty pulp, fluff and other grades qualified, the mix on the asset will move up dramatically over time. And we are right on schedule with that and expect to be successful in our different customer trials. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So when you get to the other side of where you are, what type of financial impact, if market conditions were similar to what they were in the third quarter, what type of financial upside would there be as you look at that business? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Well, I don't have a quantified number right off the top of my head, but when you think about the delta between fluff and market pulp prices and you look at that kind of margin enhancement, that's where the real benefit would come from. And as you mentioned, Mark, it will be a little bit of a multi-variable situation when we bring on our Weyerhaeuser acquisition, then a big part of the synergy opportunity is maximizing the efficiency of where we make what product. So that'll start as soon as we close the transaction. And that'll put the margin improvement from making the better grades on a little bit of a turbocharger because we'll be moving grades around to the right assets. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk about the pricing impact in Industrial Packaging. If I recall from the last call, I think you said it would be about a $10 million sequential impact. I was hoping you can you talk about the puts and takes there. Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Debby, it's Tim. I think what Carol just called out is we're expecting about $20 million of impact sequential based on the price increase. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I was actually referring to the result in the quarter and the guidance that you gave on the Q2 call. Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, okay. Well, two things. One of it \u2013 about half of it was a continuation of the pulp through (22:15) that we saw. And then just normal competitive box contracts and mix had an impact as some of the segments that carry lower margins came through stronger in the third quarter than we were anticipating at the time. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hello? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. And to Carol, Glenn and Bill Hoel, congratulations to everyone on the next chapters, really have enjoyed working with you all. I guess my first question maybe piggybacking on Debbie teeing up the box price question. Obviously, for your own business, when we look at your business or when you look at it, and you see on the one hand there was sufficient weakness in demand or however you would categorize it to lead to box price erosion. Can you comment, perhaps provide some anecdotes or some quantification in terms of how things strengthen for you such that you're now in the process of implementing your own containerboard and box price increase? And the related question I had on that, and I'll have one follow-on is, when we look at the scanner data, obviously it doesn't exactly map to your corrugated business, but the trends from Consumer Packaging land have not been particularly stellar. How do you begin to reconcile that, guys, from your vantage point, and you have the biggest one in the market, with what's been better containerboard and corrugated demand really over the last couple of months? And I have one follow-on after that. Thank you. Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Sure. Let's take the last question first, George. I think box demand \u2013 and it can always change. It's only as good as our forecast. But box demand is playing out more or less the way we have seen it for a while now in the course of 2016. So we always saw it strengthening. Our model was predicting based on economic performance and inputs that we were going to strengthen through the second half of the year. And so we're seeing that. It's a little bit better, quite frankly, than we might have thought. But our experience has been pretty good as evidenced by the numbers that we posted on demand growth. Back to your first question, I think there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, we don't see the dynamics around this price increase being any \u2013 materially different than any other price increase we've ever had. If you look at being down $5 in the quarter, I just explained a part of that is mix, but some of it was the publication down which happened earlier in the year and then also just normal activity. That normal activity has a lag to it, right. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: So some of what's showing up in the quarter is stuff that has already happened, and now it's just materializing. So, when we communicated the price increase to our customers, we were looking at the fundamentals that we saw a point in time, and then our view of how they were going to look going forward. And if anything, I'd say they turned out to be a little bit stronger than what we originally viewed. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that, Tim. And my last one, Carol, I just want to make sure I understood this correctly. I think the one-off items you said for the quarter coming up were $45 million, yet I seem to recall a $25 million and $35 million number. Can you help reconcile a correct \u2013 those numbers? Thank you. And good luck in the quarter, guys. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Yes, George. So the delta is \u2013 remember, I mentioned other seasonal increases. So the simple way to think about that is the total of $60 million minus the $45 million. That would imply the balance of the $15 million would be other normal seasonal increases from third to fourth. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Thanks again, Carol, and congratulations. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Congratulations, Carol. It's been a pleasure working with you. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : I guess a question from me, and just back on the box side of things, I mean among investors there's obviously a lot of questions and debate whether or not, how successful you're going to be able to push through the box price increase. But just curious, how much of that pricing there is contractually tied to PPW? And can you give us a sense of how much of your business is up for bid in a given year as the contracts roll off? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Phil, hi, it's Tim. It varies how much is up for bid. Year-to-year, we've seen some pretty dramatic swings. It's just based on length of contract, length of agreements that we have with customers, and then opportunities that we see along the way for either adding to position and renegotiating early or not. So pretty much everything that we have is based on some form of either contract or customer agreement that we have, whether it's completely formal in the way of contract or it's some other type of agreement. So what we do is we go through, similar to every other price increase we've ever had and for the number of customers we have, it comes down to customer by customer across the whole business. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then I think, Tim, you mentioned early just in terms of this implementation, from what you're seeing thus far, it seems like pretty consistent with what you've seen in the past few. Is that a fair characterization? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, I've seen no dynamics or circumstances that would say it's any different than what we've seen in other price increases. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Very helpful. And I guess shifting gears to your consumer business which actually performed pretty well. Pricing is holding up pretty good. Can you provide any color on how backlogs are shaping up on SBS? Any noticeable shifts in the market, either from imports or exports on the bleached board side of things? Thanks. And good luck on the quarter. W. Michael Amick - International Paper Co.: Hey, Phil, it's Mike Amick. I would characterize the market as kind of okay. As you know, we're kind of heading into seasonally slower fourth quarter. But our volume quarter-over-quarter in Consumer Packaging was about flat. The good news is, is that we're also seeing a little bit of an uptick in food service, both in terms of shipments we saw in the fourth quarter as well as bookings. So we're a little bit optimistic or biased a little bit in terms of what we're seeing. The in-store traffic with food service, since kind of single-serve retail has been a little bit of a headwind this year as you can see reported out with some of the retailers. But overall, we've performed pretty well in that segment and continue to do so. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. And, Carol, I'd just like to extend my best wishes to you as well. It's been a pleasure. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered if you can just give us any thoughts on sort of CapEx as we move towards 2017? And in particular, I recall a year or two ago, we were talking about some incremental CapEx going into the containerboard mills and I'd like to just get an update on that. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Mark, this is Carol. So let me start that by saying, this year, our CapEx target is $1.3 billion. Our plans for next year at this point are influenced, of course, by the acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser cellulose fiber business. So, including that business, our plans at this point are about $1.5 billion of CapEx. And included in that $1.3 billion and that $1.5 billion is the continuation of the implementation of the projects that we spoke about in our North American Industrial Packaging business that Tim and his team are executing against. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Then I just had two quick follow-ons. One, Tim, can you just clarify where you guys stand on containerboard export pricing and whether you've announced anything there, and just what the volume is for you relative to your overall containerboard business? And then, Mike, I noticed that the food service revenues were flat, and I just \u2013 I know you'd picked up a lot of cup contracts over the last few years, and I just wondered, is all that played out at this point? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. On export, it's \u2013 price is fairly stable as Carol mentioned, on the front end. Demand has been pretty good. This year kraft linerboard exports in total for U.S. producers is up about 2.5%. We look at the demand across the regions, and we say \u2013 we kind of expect somewhere between 2% and 3.5% growth. So it seems like it's right in the expectations, maybe on the low side of expectations for growth. For us, it's somewhere between 12% and 15%, it varies. But we look at it as, for our business, what we're doing is responding to what customers are demanding based on their needs. And there's been some changes in trade flows over the course of the past year given the FX volatility. But we see the markets as pretty stable and continuing to grow at what would be an expected rate. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. No price hikes there, right? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: It feels like things have firmed quite a bit. Our supply chain is very tight at the moment. So we're struggling to even keep pace with the demand that we're getting from customers. So, at the moment, things are extending out a little bit in terms of lead times on export orders. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hey, Mark. On your food service question \u2013 try to simplify this. It's a little more complicated. But in terms of cups, and I'll speak in terms of the bodies themselves, our overall growth is still pretty positive. So those contracts haven't played out. Our flat revenue is a combination of a little bit of mix that's in there as well as some \u2013 a little bit of price decline over the quarter. But that's been relatively small. And the lid side of the business is a little bit down versus the body side. But overall, we're still growing the business. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask one \u2013 I mean perhaps this is a silly question, but it's just something I don't understand. I think you referenced $35 million of a non-cash charge related to inventory revaluation as box prices or as the board price flowed through. Can you help explain to me what that is, how that works? I guess intuitively I would have been thinking, kind of would have been the other way around if prices are moving higher. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Yes, Chris, this is Carol. And I'm going to attempt to do this without belaboring this call with an accounting lesson. But it is somewhat of a complicated issue. In simple terms, we run our businesses in a FIFO model, first in, first out. But we keep our corporate books on a LIFO model, last in, first out. And so we keep that, you call it your LIFO reserve, your LIFO balance, which is your contra inventory account, on the corporate books. And basically, you do LIFO because costs go up through time and that's the best way, the best effect to get the best outcome for the company. When you have a dramatic shift, and for us it's around the inventory between our mills and our box plants, we charge our box plants market price. So we're going to move that board into our box business at the higher price. But you do last in, first out relative to your accounting. So you have to balance that LIFO account. The other thing that comes into play is you've got to get that LIFO account balanced by year end. So the timing of this increase coming right at the end of the year causes us to have to balance that account in the quarter. What's most important is non-cash. And in LIFO, when you make adjustments to those LIFO balances, it's non-cash. But due to the way we run our business and our accounting convention, that charge hits us in this fourth quarter. So that's my best explanation. And we can always follow up with more if you feel like you want some more information. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, I think that's helpful. So it's not just what would have been referenced here. It's a cumulative catch-up for the full year as well? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: You've got to get that \u2013 what you do is you get that \u2013 LIFO has to balance by year end. So, if this had happened earlier in the year, we would have done it through the period of time. Why? It's just kind of unique that it's of a significant size. And of course, the scale of our business makes it significant in size and scale. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. Follow-up question I had was for Tim. So you kind of referenced that box demand has been playing out, I think it was in response to George's question earlier, that box demand has been playing out kind of as you'd anticipated and is pretty solid here through the back half of the year. As you look forward \u2013 and again, fully appreciating this is a very fluid and dynamic market and model, probably. How are you feeling regarding the next, let's call it, 12 months to 18 months? I mean do you still feel that box demand can continue at a point, point-and-a-half sort of pace? What do you think the puts and takes are there? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, 18 months is a little bit beyond my radar screen there. So I'd put it this way. In the moment, looking forward over the next couple of quarters, we feel pretty good. Our model is only as good as what people are saying the next couple of quarters are going to be on any number of economic activity levels. And so it's been kind of in the zone where there hasn't been a whole lot of change to that that would affect the components of the model. So I feel good about the fourth quarter. Seen nothing that should make us feel any way but positive as we go into the first quarter of next year. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Scott. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to talk about North American Industrial Packaging for a minute. Obviously, the volumes are coming in relatively strong. And you mentioned some of the input cost inflation, but I guess if I look at the year-over-year EBITDA bridge, the input costs are relatively flat year-over-year. So just trying to reconcile, I mean when we look at the increase, is this \u2013 and you mentioned a lot of tightness in your export markets. Is this more of a supply demand driven price increase relative to a input cost increase? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I think all of those factors weigh on price movements. I would just say this in terms of the year-over-year on input costs, some of this is timing and input started moving up during the third quarter. And the other piece of this, inputs, no question have been a tailwind for the past 12 months or 18 months, but that's recently changed. And I think what may not be as obvious to people looking at our results is the tailwind from input costs did a great job helping us cover normal inflation that we encounter year-in and year-out. And all of a sudden, the tailwind has turned to a headwind. And so the inflation is there and now the input cost rises are there and you get kind of a double impact. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just sticking there for a minute, I think, Carol, maybe you mentioned normal competitive box pressure at least in the third quarter. When I go back and look at the last two price increases in 2012 and 2013, I think there was a period of time there where it felt like the competitive dynamic in the box business had slowed down a little bit and you were actually able to hold pricing on the box side. Did something change over the last 12 months where maybe the box business became a little bit more competitive just versus the post price increase environment? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No, I don't think so. I think what you've got to keep in mind is that in January \u2013 I mean this is always a competitive business, but in January, there was a published down that impacted price and it's been working its way through our financials based on all of the different customer contracts and agreements that we have. And so, if there's a change this year over prior periods, that happened to us early in the year and we've been dealing with it. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Last one from me. In the prepared slides, slide nine, you mentioned retail and traditional distribution growth. I think you said it was a meaningful segment for you now. Were you referring to e-commerce, and if so, how big is e-commerce now for the total company? Thanks. Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, on a relative basis, it's still \u2013 it's big. But on a relative basis, it's still small but growing at a rapid rate. And it's not just online retail, it's also traditional distribution. We have exposure across the spectrum and it's been performing very well for us. So that's one positive. The other positive is the protein segment for us, which has been under some pressure over the past couple of years, seems like it is coming back in a more stable way and processed food for us has also been good. So I think it's a mix of different segments. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Yes, and good morning. And, Carol, great working with you, all the best. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Chip. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : First question has to do with something that's kind of perplexed us a little bit. And that is if you -- we have done a deep dive into the sort of unaccounted for tonnage which averages somewhere 150,000 tons to 200,000 tons a month when you \u2013 we get the monthly data, and it seems to suggest that there's been a rather sharp, roughly 200,000 ton drop in what we would consider in transit inventories in the last two months. And I guess if that's true that that would show up in your system with, I guess, lengthening delivery times if that's in fact true. Are you seeing anything in your business that would suggest that there is less out in the field? I'm talking about trucks and railcars. And that's affecting your business at all? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, I think what we've experienced during the course of the year, and it started late last year, was the supply chain working very efficiently and effectively. And so things are flowing through fairly well. And another piece of it that can impact it is just how months end in terms of whether they end on a weekend or not. And technically things have to be unloaded and hit the floor to not be in transit any more. So there's some anomalies month-to-month and just in terms of how the month ends. But our supply chain right now is incredibly tight. So, as I mentioned earlier on exports, we're pushing things out and we're just \u2013 we're trying to catch up to what we think would be more sustainable levels of inventory across our system. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And just getting back on the numbers to make sure I understood them. It seems like the impact of Matthew on the non-containerboard mills, I guess that would be Consumer and Paper or Printing Papers, would be $25 million. And then the $35 million refer to just the Matthew and the inventory adjustment in Industrial. Is that correct? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: So, Chip, the $25 million that we referenced was for paper and pulp. And some sub-segment of that was Matthew. So there's some other costs there. And then the $35 million that we referred to \u2013 I mean the $45 million that we referred to out of the total $60 million was between the two businesses. So there's some subset of that $25 million is Matthew in paper and pulp. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: And it's not an insignificant number, yeah. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. Because it looks like when I added up all those numbers you gave us that is \u2013 it's coming up to something like $125 million. And then about $45 million of that is, as you said, one-time, and maybe $80 million of that is \u2013 wouldn't be considered one-time, but would be largely seasonal and other things. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: I think that's \u2013 you're definitely \u2013 that's the right direction for sure. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And then last one real quickly is, I noticed in the data the last two months that while the AF&PA gives us their survey every year, roughly in May, they certainly imply a certain capacity when you divide what they say production is into the operating rate. It looks like that capacity is actually down the last couple of months. And I didn't know if there was anything you're seeing out there that might explain why we just literally don't see any projects financed across the industry to add discrete capacity additions, especially given the fact that demand is growing especially in tons. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Chip, this is Mark. I think the capacity evolution in containerboard, you go back a couple of years with some of the additions that have come on, there's been a mixed track record in the success of bringing that board into an actual box. So I think that weighs on people's investment decisions. I think the market is pretty well balanced. And I think that that's really the reality. You've got more than just containerboard. You've got to figure out a way to get it through the supply chain into a package that's designed for a customer, so downstream converting into value chain. All of those things are important. And so I think right now, we said this two years ago and 18 months ago, that we thought this capacity would play out, be absorbed, some would work, some wouldn't. And I think that's where we are. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, everyone. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Brian. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hey, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I just wanted to ask about the containerboard economic downtime. It ticked up a little bit from the second quarter. And I presume some of that is just to help support the price increase you have out there in the market. But now that you've gotten the $40 through, just wondering -- presumably margins are going to be better going forward. Just wondering if we can see that tick back down to some of the levels that we saw before 2016, 2015? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, I think the premise of the question is not on target. We run our system based on how we need to optimize our margins and service our facilities. And so tons are not tons. The mills produce a range of products. We need more of some and less of others. And we balance it out and make sure that we're doing the right thing from a cash standpoint and the right thing from a margin standpoint. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then just wanted to better understand the timing of the earnings benefit you'd expect from the higher containerboard pricing. I think you referenced a $20 million benefit into 4Q which is obviously less than the annualized impact of it. But do you think it will be kind of fully in your numbers by the end of the first quarter, and so you'd kind of see it in the 2Q numbers? Or how do you kind of expect it to the flow through the numbers? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I expect it to flow through pretty much on the same pace and track that prior increases have flowed through. So we've got tens of thousands of customers. We've got contracts and agreements with all of them and it will follow the cadence of those agreements. And it's really no different than what it's been in prior times. It's usually pretty fast. It's usually over a couple of quarters, but... Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That helps. And just one last one if I could. I think, just looking at the maintenance outage schedule, looks like it came down a little bit for Industrial and Printing Papers. Just wondering if there's some stuff is just kind of slipping to 2017, or are you just seeing better productivity or maybe lower costs or just what's kind of driving that? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Yeah, Brian, this is Carol. One of the things that we do is we put a plan together at the beginning of the year of what we feel like where \u2013 want to execute against and then we work like crazy throughout the year to find better ways to do things and opportunities. And so evidenced by the way Mark talked about the business and the conditions, we've worked hard to find better ways. And yes, some things we've pushed out to \u2013 but we feel very comfortable with those decisions. And we feel like we've got a great plan and a good plan for the fourth quarter. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, appreciate it, and good luck, Carol. It was great working with you. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, Carol, best of luck to you, and thank you. One on -- just follow-up on box demand. I know George asked earlier about the apparent disconnect between CPG demand and box demand. But there's also been a disconnect between industrial demand and box demand. Industrial and CPG are two pretty big pieces of the box market that seem to be flat to going in the wrong direction. So what are we missing in terms of why box demand is doing apparently much better than the broader economy? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, well, I don't know that I can answer that fully. But I would say this, we think that non-durable production is, in part, a good proxy for box demand. But it's not always in the moment lined up exactly the same way. There's been periods where box demand has outperformed non-durables and vice versa. And there's other components of economic activity that actually influence box demand. Some of our demand trends have been things I mentioned earlier, where protein is starting to come back off some depressed levels over the past couple of years. Distribution and online retail continues to grow for us quite well. And processed food has actually been pretty good for us. You have to remember, a year or two ago, shrinking at 3%; doesn't feel like it's doing that any more. So it's not stellar growth, but it's not performing as bad as it has in prior periods. So I think that based on the way we look at how box demand gets driven, it's performing the way we would expect it to in the moment. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Adam, this is Mark. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks \u2013 go ahead, Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah, just kind of, one of the views we have in addition to the segment discussion Tim had, if you think back to the GDP number for the quarter and you look at the total, it was very modest. But if you look at the components, the consumer section of GDP was up almost 3%. Those are the kinds of activities by the consumer that drive box demand. Even if they're trading out of a consumer good into a fresh good or other segment, with a consumer component of GDP at 2.8%, it's pretty squared with our mind around why box demand's at 1.5%. There was a lot of negatives on the non-consumer side which netted out a 1.4% GDP. So, for us, it looks like it squares up pretty well. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that clarification, Mark. And Tim or Mark, just one more \u2013 I think, Tim, you talked about your supply chain being quite tight. I think in response to George's question about box price erosion, you were talking about how some of it is a lag from the January cup, but some of it is related to competitive activity. So, if your supply chain is really tight, why would there be sufficient competitive activity on the box side such that you're seeing erosion in your box prices to a fairly meaningful degree? Timothy S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, and mix was a piece of it too, Adam. And I think just timing. Some of these things get settled as a negotiating point at a point in time that take through to work their way towards implementation. So I mean, to me, we're not seeing anything unusual or abnormal from every other time we've had inflections in pricing. So it feels completely normal to me. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much, Tim. Appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple quickies. First of all, I just wanted to make sure I understood the charges in India. If I understood correctly, you were actually doing some infrastructure development as opposed to just due diligence for a packaging venture? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: No. What that was is we were looking at potential containerboard investments in India. In order to do that, we had to make some investments to secure some potential land for sites. And then we just did some engineering work to model different types of business models, whether it be a recycled machine or whether it included box business or not. So those engineering charges, we didn't build anything. We just did some engineering. And then we had a small security deposit on some land. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thanks. And then just a wrinkle, please, on the LIFO/FIFO question. And Carol confirmed what we know, which is you're doing transfer pricing at market value. So I guess I just want to know, is it fair to say that the delta in November will remain a $50 a ton or does the PPW print cut that to $40? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Steve, I appreciate the question. But I would respectfully decline to answer the exact transfer pricing in our company. But what I would say, and I'm looking at my colleague Tim, and Bill across the table, we announced a $50 increase for October with our customers and that's the increase that we're out pushing and implementing at this point in time. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Very good. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, and best wishes to Carol and Glenn and everyone on their transitions. Just a question on Printing Papers. In the quarter, I think you referenced lower prices in Europe and some of your Brazilian exports. I'm just wondering, has that continued in 4Q? And with paper prices maybe improving domestically in Brazil, are there opportunities to repatriate some of those export tons into Brazil if demand is a little better there? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Anthony, this is Mark. On Brazil, the majority of what showed up in pricing for export was actually mix of product and geographic mix. So, in terms of the price in a same store, if you will, or same market, it's pretty stable. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, okay. And then just kind of tacking on a general question on Brazil. The 4Q view, I mean, you get a little bit of help from seasonality, but are you seeing any kind of improvement or inflections in Brazilian demand, either paper or containerboard, just from maybe a bit more stronger demand there or a kind of recovering economy at all? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: We are. We are seeing some improved demand in our box business. And for our box business had one of the best quarters since we've owned it in Brazil. And so, as the government moves to a more stable situation, I think there's many experts saying it could turn positive in the economy next year, which will be helpful. And on the paper side, demand in Brazil is pretty steady. It's not as high as it was pre-recession and pre-crisis, but pretty steady. And as a follow-up on the question you asked about export, because the Brazil demand is steady, we have announced a price increase for the export business that's effective in the fourth quarter. So that whole system of Brazilian production for Brazil, and then the Brazilian production for the rest of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa and Europe is all \u2013 seems to be getting a bit stronger. So we are out with a price increase for the fourth quarter in the export business. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. The pension, I assume what you're showing in the balance sheet is the change quarters, just the contribution. And if that's the case, I was wondering if you could give at least a little bit of insight to how you might \u2013 the kind of recent moves in the market since you revalued midyear as well as interest rates might reflect the pension when you reported on your 10-K? Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: Yes, Gail, this is Carol. So just one changed to what we said. We actually had to revalue the pension at the end of the third quarter. Once we triggered the accounting treatment in the second quarter that puts you kind of in a new territory. And if you have any change in the pension, you're required to remeasure. So we actually remeasured in the third quarter. And in the third quarter remeasurement, the interest rates, discount rates, they dropped another 20 basis points. So what you're seeing for that \u2013 the gap, you're seeing the positive impact of the contribution and the performance, negative impact from the discount rate. And that'll all be very clear to you when we come out with our Q. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And just a couple of other quick ones. Are you expecting a dividend from Ilim this year? Usually, I would have thought you'd have announced it by now. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: We actually did. We got that dividend, was in the second quarter. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. Carol Louise Roberts - International Paper Co.: We announced it in the second quarter. And I think it's \u2013 because we do that annual chart, it's not showing up. But it was there. I think it was \u2013 what was it? $55 million. But we've already gotten that cash in. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And then just on the storm impact, the numbers that you're giving, I mean is everything in the past at this point? Or are there kind of any potential lingering issues in terms of logistics, customer start-ups or fiber costs down the road? Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : What \u2013 the numbers that I gave you is our attempt to capture it all in the quarter. There's some flow-through that's continuing with us which is some fiber costs. And there's some transportation disruption. But most of it is in the rearview mirror. But there's a little residual that'll hang over because clearly that area was just hit so hard and some devastating damage. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And I would now like to turn it back over to Jay Royalty for any closing remarks. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call. And our phone numbers are on page 17 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your line.",

And welcome to International Paper\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we will open up for your questions after today\u2019s prepared remarks. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Jay Royalty to begin. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Royalty : Thanks, Maria, and good morning everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Incoming Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on Slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings press release and today\u2019s presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, Slide 4 provides context around the joint venture\u2019s financial information and statistical measures. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning four our call. Before I get into the slides, I wanted to acknowledge that while, as Jay mentioned, Glenn is joining me to review our results and outlook this morning. Carol is also here with us, in the room along with other members of the senior leadership team at International Paper. So, I\u2019m on Slide 5, make some opening comments. Before we go through the quarter and full year results, I wanted to make a couple of comments about the incident we had at the Pensacola Mill last week. And first and foremost, we are very thankful that no one was injured in this incident. Our priority is on the health and safety of our colleagues, contractors that work with us and the residence of the community. We\u2019re doing everything we can to help restore the surrounding community and get things back in normal as quickly as possible. I\u2019d like to thank everyone involved for their extraordinary efforts and commitment over the past couple of weeks. Glenn will provide more details later on the call for his impact and our outlook for Pensacola. So, as we go back to the content of Slide 5, International Paper delivered another year of strong performance with free cash flow of $1.9 billion and return on invested capital of about 10%, nicely exceeding our cost of capital. We made substantial progress on many fronts. Further strengthening our North American Industrial Packaging business, we completed the acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser pulp business in December, which we have combined with IP\u2019s legacy pulp business to form our new Global Cellulose Fibers business. We converted a machine at the Riegelwood mill from Coated Paperboard capability to fluff pulp, which gives us the capacity to grow both plus and high value specialties pulp products within the larger more capable new Cellulose Fibers platform. In Europe, we acquired a top quartile mill asset in Madrid which we will convert later this year to light weight high performance recycled containerboard to support our European box business. And finally, we finalized the sale of our Asia Industrial Packaging converting business, further focusing on strengthening the IP portfolio. On the capital allocation front, our board of directors authorized 5% increase in IP\u2019s annual dividend, moving it to $1.85 a share, in making at the fifth consecutive year of a dividend increase. While 2016 didn\u2019t play out exactly how we had envisioned a year ago as we were sitting here talking about the year. I feel good about what we accomplished and how we executed in a pretty tough global environment. As we go through the call today and outlined where we are now and the key catalyst that we have for 2017. We have line of sight to grow our EBITDA this year by 10%. So on Slide 6, and turning to the full year financial results. Just talk a bit about a few of the metrics. The majority of the revenue decline, if you see on this slide, is attributable to the sales of the Sun JV and the Asia box business, as well as the sale of our Coated Bristols brand and that business. Lower earnings were primarily due to margin pressure across most of our businesses through most of 2016, along with escalating input costs in the latter portion of the year. We did see signs of strengthening in some of our key markets in the second half of the year, which enabled us to announce and implement a number of price increases across various businesses that will all benefit us in 2017. Debt levels were increased to 2016, primarily to fund the pulp acquisition. And as we\u2019ve commented on previously, our priority in 2017 broking debt reduction. Moving to Slide 7, I\u2019d be continued to strong and sustainable \u2013 strong trend for sustainable free cash flow in 2016. This gave us the horsepower to execute our strategy creating value for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 8, we also delivered another strong year of return on invested capital, solidly above our cost of capital. This is our second consecutive year within ROIC spread to our weighted average cost of capital more than 200 basis points, and seventh straight years of ROIC above our cost of capital. I\u2019m going to now turn it over to Glenn, and ask him to cover the performance across our businesses, as well as provide an update on the balance sheet and our outlook. Glenn? Glenn Landau : Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to be here. Let me just begin by extending my sincere thanks and enormous congratulations to Carol Roberts, who is sitting here beside me as she used closure of this chapter of her professional life and [indiscernible]. And as I know I can speak to so many of you here in the room and across the company, as well as many on the line today, you have a made a different for International Paper have positively impacted so many of our senior leadership support. So Carol, all the best. Now, back to business. I\u2019m on Slide 9, which is about full year operating EPS Bridge from 2015 to 2016. As Mark already shared year-over-year earnings were impacted by price erosion and weaker mix across many of our businesses this past year, driving a $0.70 unfavorable swing versus 2015 levels. Biggest movers were containerboard for export, global pulp and boxes in the North America, which decline modestly for the first three quarters of the year largely precipitated by the January 2015 index increase, all prior to our implementation of our October box price increases late in the fourth quarter. Volume of the net positive for the year, primarily function of improving North American box demand. Operation quite solid and improving performance across our mill system we\u2019re drag on earning in the year have been impacted by several items including our Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion to ramp up, Hurricane Matthew and a significant non-cash LIFO inventory reevaluation associated with our October containerboard increase implementation. And while lower input costs were tailwind for much of the year driving a net positive, we saw meaningful shift in that trend over the last few months of 2016 as many inputs began to turn high we\u2019ll get more into that later in the call as we speak to the outlook. So moving across the bridge, a lower effective tax rate and interest expense combined for a dime of improvement and Ilim contributed to the positive largely driven by FX. And lastly earnings associated with our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s pulp business in the month of December at $0.03 to the year. Now turning to Slide 10, International Paper delivered solid results in the fourth quarter supported by increasing box demand and higher prices of containerboard and boxes in our North American Industrial Packaging business. This all against the backdrop though of fallen pulp prices and rising input costs primarily OCC and energy. On the operations of cost front c,ontinued solid mill performance was unfavorably impacted by seasonality and where I mean by that is higher consumption of energy in raw materials associated with colder temperatures. As well as a handful of non-repeating items including the impact of Hurricane Matthew, our year-end LIFO inventory reevaluation, as I mentioned in the previous slide, and as well as higher expenses related medical claims in the quarter. All of which if you remember from our third quarter call, we\u2019re expected in part of our outlook. Further, the Ilim JV delivered another strong quarter of results with operational EBITDA of $180 million. And strategically, we close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s pulp business marking the beginning of our newly combined Global Cellulose Fibers business segment of which the integration is opt to a great start and we\u2019re delighted to welcome 2,000 new colleagues to the IP team creating the preeminent Global Cellulose Fibers business in dynamic and growing space, the long runway of value creation so more to come on now. The quarter-over-quarter bridge on Slide 11, depicts what I just said, higher prices for containerboard and boxes in North America Industrial Packaging were offset by lower prices \u2013 lower pulp prices and IP\u2019s legacy pulp business. And despite four fewer shipping days for North America box shipments, volume was flat sequentially due to a higher daily demand for boxes of 5% in the quarter, which was really meaningful. Operations and other costs were down $0.18 quarter-over-quarter, about a half of which was due to seasonality mainly higher energy consumption and the other half due to non-repeating items as I described on the previous slide. If this were a headwind and OCC continue to escalate as we expecting the quarter. Turning to the businesses, and starting with industrial packaging on Slide 12, initial benefits of the price increase were realized as expected in the quarter. Domestic containerboard increase was fully implemented up to the $40 index moved and North America box prices were up $4 per ton on average quarter-over-quarter. Volume was strong but higher containerboard exports and the better and expected daily box demand rate only partially offset the impact of four fewer shipping days though. In operations and other costs are largest business that the blunt of the previously mentioned non-repeating items and input costs were higher with OCC accounting for half of the total impact with an increasing trend driving a higher exit rate than average in the quarter. The next Slide on 13 is intended to provide some additional color on how we are thinking about 2017 full year benefits associated with the October 2016 domestic containerboard and price increase. Starting with the upper left hand portion of slide, you can see that IP has roughly 10 million tons that are within the scope of this announced increase. 9 million tons of U.S. integrated box business and about 1 million tons of domestic containerboard sales. So the simple math here, given the $40 expectation I referenced earlier, is about $400 million annualized. While we expect to realize $400 million in absolute terms, there are several factors to consider relative to the year-over-year earnings impact. Moving your attention to the graph on the top right, and factoring initial benefits we saw in the fourth quarter, year-over-year exit rate U.S. box prices remain below fourth quarter 2015 levels. As we report quarterly in the appendix, North American box prices on average are down $18 per ton versus the fourth quarter 2015. Largely due to the impacts related to the $15 per ton index reset in early 2015 and normal erosion we see prior to our October increase. So, roughly half of the expected increase benefit essentially goes to price restoration and, considering the rising OCC cost escalation trend, another material portion of the increase just covers this headwind. All that said, the increase execution is moving along smoothly and we expect full implementation by the end of the first quarter. Okay, now on Slide 14, I\u2019d like to turn to our newly combined business, Global Cellulose Fibers, which beginning with this fourth quarter release will be reported on a standalone business segment. As you can see on the map the combined business has a solid fleet of mills strategically positioned across the southeast U.S. along with a couple of specialized processing facilities in Mississippi and Poland. In addition we have acquired a highly capable and competitive northern softwood craft mill in Alberta, Canada. So in total, IP\u2019s Global Cellulose Fibers business has a combined 3.6 million tons of capacity for softwood and fluff pulp, as well as other specialties applications and is extremely well positioned to serve our global customers in these attractive and growing segments. Looking forward, given our current fixed utilization depicted in the pie chart in the top right, there are significant product mix upgrade opportunities to fluff and our specialty products, as well as installed incremental fluff capacity post our Riegelwood conversion to grow with our customers\u2019 increasing demand. So, with this exciting combination, IP could not be better positioned to take advantage of this very attractive global markets. On Slide 15, just as some background, I\u2019m taking a closer look at global fluff pulp markets, we have a nice mix of both established and higher growth emerging markets geographically and a wide range of products with different levels of maturity in the marketplace. So for example, North America and Western Europe continue to grow in line with expecting population trends while emerging markets like Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will drive most of the growth rate expected to be 4%. Primary applications for fluff pulp are spread between baby diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products and with our additional capabilities of the Weyerhaeuser system, we have the technical and human resources, as well as the manufacturing capacity, to drive innovation and product development in to other high value specialties in the pulp space that will provide further growth opportunities beyond those reflected here. Okay, turning to Slide 16, and taking a look at our pro forma results for the combined business, there was a significant reduction in earnings from 2015 to 2016. This was primarily due to two factors. One was the costs associated with the Riegelwood conversion and ramp-up in our Legacy business, which amounted to roughly $80 million in 2016. The other is price and mix erosion which was experienced evenly across both Legacy businesses as both softwood and fluff prices came under pressure in 2016. Further, IP saw the negative mix impact associated with Riegelwood capacity which ramped up our market softwood pulp in the second half of 2016 as we were working toward fluff qualification with our customers. So a negative mix effect there. The outlook for 2017 is a mix of both favorable and timing related unfavorable items with a slants to positive. To the upside we have expected demand growth, the synergy opportunities, and our recently announced price increases for softwood and fluff pulp products. But, clearly exit rate prices for 2016 were lower than average prices for the year and the large extended average in capital investment project underway at the Port Wentworth mill had a significant cost impact in the quarter. With that said, this large project to upgrade the recovery boiler, turbine and power system at the mill has attractive energy savings benefits and we\u2019ll enjoy those, following completion, for years to come. On 17, back to the integration, you can see the synergy opportunity and associated timeline for realization of the newly combined businesses. There are three major buckets of synergies, overhead, commercial mix improvement, which are both fluff and specialty opportunities, and a large bucket of manufacturing, supply chain and sourcing opportunities that we will leverage. Looking at the chart on the right, you can see the expected ramp-up and run rate targets for year end 2017 and 2018. We expect a run rate of $100 million in synergies by the end of this year adding approximately $50 million to earnings for 2017. One-time costs will be treated as special items and are expected to be around $85 million of which about half were expense from December and the balance will be spread over this year and next, all will be treated as special items as I just said. Related to synergies, we know how to do this. We\u2019ve done it before. The teams are off an running, have line of sight to the target and we\u2019ll work hard to exceed expectations. Turning now to the consumer packaging business on Slide 18. We had a light quarter as we saw continued price pressure in elements of the folding carton segment and on plate stock along with seasonally lower volume. Operations were as expected, but costs were higher due to seasonality. Planned maintenance averages were also higher given the plan [indiscernible] average. Now moving to Printing Papers, Slide 19. As we said earlier, given the new Cellulose Fibers segment, reporting for paper beginning this quarter will no longer include pulp. In terms of results, price mix was impacted primarily by higher export sales out of North America. However we experienced good volume mainly due seasonally stronger volume in Brazil. Operations and costs were negatively impacted by a challenging operational quarter at a couple of our European mills, Hurricane Matthew in North America, and seasonably higher operating costs and higher medical claims in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Planned maintenance outage expenses were higher in the quarter and we experienced some unfavorable FX impacts in Brazil due to the strengthening house. Now moving to Ilim on Slide 20, the JV had another strong quarter capped off what we consider a great year. All three mills set production records for both periods, the quarter and the year, and strong demand primarily in China led to higher sales volume in the fourth quarter with total volume up a little over 5% for the full year. Looking to the first quarter, JV expects modest pulp price improvement to be more than offset by normal seasonality, resulting in lower sales volume and higher input costs primarily wood. Additionally, the board of directors at the JV has authorized a cash dividend to be distributed in March of which IP will receive $100 million. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 21, IP experienced a step up in leverage ratios in 2016 as you can see, primarily due to increased debt taken to facilitate the pulp business acquisition but also impacted lower EBITDA performance. Our pension gap decreased by $200 million as we made voluntary contributions totaling $750 million in the year, some of which was offset by a 30 basis point decline in discount rate by the end of the year. However, the discount rate did improve significantly in the fourth quarter as we exited the year versus prior quarter trend, so really better than it could have been. The additional debt taken on this year largely to fund the acquisition, was done [indiscernible] tranches at an average interest rate of 0.7%. Our plan as we work to pay down debt to restore leverage ratios in line with our target within the next two years will be to take out new debt. Okay, matrix and before I speak to the specifics regarding outlook for the first quarter, I\u2019d note that given the evolving situation at Pensacola, our matrix does not reflect any of the impacts associated with the mill interruption but I will speak more to that following this slide. So back on Slide 22, starting with price and specifically we expect to see significant benefits from implementation of the North America price increase in both domestic containerboard and U.S. box in the range of about $70 million. For volume, additional shipping days in North America will be largely offset by a lower daily shipping rate and we expect earnings from the additional volume from the first full quarter of the acquisition in Cellulose Fibers to also be offset by normal seasonal decline in Brazil, so net-net, flattish in this volume bucket. Within operations and costs, the non-repeats of the impact from the one-off items from the fourth quarter, remember the hurricane, LIFO, and medical claims, are expected to be a benefit of $30 million for packaging and $20 million for papers in the coming quarter. So the red that jumps off the page are our plans \u2013 our underlined plans, maintenance outage expenses in the quarter, which would be $102 million higher sequentially, so really just timing along with the addition of outages associated with our expanded Cellulose Fibers business. Input costs are expected to increase primarily across North American operations by $40 million versus the fourth quarter driven largely by OCC and natural gas. And finally, relative of a couple of the items in the other categories, we\u2019re expecting a higher tax rate in Q1 around 33%, so back to a more normalized level. And results at the Ilim JV are expected to be lower primarily due to seasonally lower volume and seasonally higher input costs. So, turning to Slide 23, let me provide a brief update on the Pensacola mills digester incident which occurred on the evening of Sunday, January 22, and for those of you not familiar with the digester, it\u2019s a large pressurized vessel that cooks wood chips, turning wood chips in to un-bleached Cellulose Fiber. And relative to this incident, the vessel \u2013 the digester vessel failed, causing separation of its top and associated damage to the adjacent powerhouse due to flying debris. At the instant of the failure, the pressurized content within the digester, primarily raw pulp, water, and pulping mister, were released to the surrounding areas. Thankfully not a single person at the mill was injured. And of course, our immediate response was to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and neighbors, in and around the site. We accomplished this and shortly after, the following day, a unified command was formed including representatives from the Escambia County Health Department, the Florida Department Environmental Protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as International Paper. The unified command took full control and led the development and execution of plans to clean the impacted areas and to address community concerns. At this point, we have already made significant progress on the cleanup and will not stop until the area is restored. In terms of our progress towards bringing the mill back to an a operating state, earlier this week we restarted the powerhouse and resumed partial operations of the pulp line, which is supported by a different set of smaller batch digesters. Today we continue to ramp up production of fluff pulp and expect to be fully online by the weekend. Relative to containerboard though, repairing the damage continuous digester will take some time. And while we\u2019re working toward a firm estimate, what we do know now is that startup will not take place in the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll continue to use our extensive containerboard mill network to meet customer needs over the next several weeks. As you can appreciate, just 10 days post the incident, it is difficult to estimate the full financial impact, as well as the timeline associated with this situation. With that said, we know there will be major costs incurred. In this quarter and beyond and at this point we expect the total impact to be in excess of $50 million. This will not be a special item. But we do have property damage and business interruption insurance that we expect will cover a significant portion of the costs. Relative to our insurance, we will have a deductible up to $20 million which you can say, essentially, that\u2019s a cap on our exposure. With that said, timing of the insurance recovery will be uneven and there will likely be some lag associated with getting our claims covered. Net-net we see this all trued up by year end. Finally, the changer digester, which was the primary equipment impacted, is fully depreciated so no write-off will come with at least this primary piece of equipment. So, given the evolving nature of the situation, we commit and plan to provide a more specific estimate of timing and costs publicly before the end of the quarter, so more to come on this. Lastly on Slide 24, here we have some of the key financial metrics we normally provide to build a picture of our planning assumptions for 2017. CapEx will be higher at around $1.5 billion which includes the expanded Cellulose Fibers business, approximately $100 million of the delta, as well as the mill conversion in Madrid. We expect 2017 depreciation also to be up to roughly $1.4 billion including $140 million of depreciation carried over from the recently acquired pulp assets. Interest expense is impacted by our hard debt profile and corporate items and our effective tax rate will stay within normalized levels into 2017 based on what we know today. Also given the escalating input cost backdrop, we have included our current view relative to this impact year-over-year in the range of about $180 million to $200 million higher in 2017. And as this item we see this as directional only as we note that there\u2019s more likely incremental risk as many of these items are already looking to be pushing the upper end of the range. So with that, I will turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Glenn. What I\u2019d like to do on the last slide of our prepared remarks is wrap up with our focus for 2017. We expect, as I mentioned earlier, to continue the trend of strong cash generation and returns above our cost of capital. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, given what we know today and the catalyst we have in play, we have line of sight to grow full year EBITDA by 10%. We have great opportunity to integrate our newly acquired pulp business, drive synergies and improve our overall mix. The acquisition brings us great people, best in class assets, and second to none capabilities. Together with IP\u2019s business, we\u2019ll create significant value for our customers and shareholders over time. We expect higher earnings in our North American Industrial Packaging business, due to benefits from the previously announced price increase, growing demand from our customers, and our own internal improvement initiatives. We also expect to improve margins with continued strong operations and extensive cost reduction efforts across many of our other businesses. Everything is on track for our planned conversion of the Madrid mill in the second half of the year, which will enable a better offering for our customers and earnings improvement for our European Industrial Packaging business. The Ilim JV is well positioned for another strong year of performance. And with the strong free cash flow that comes from all of this, we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital to create value with a near-term focus on debt reduction. I feel good about how International Paper\u2019s positioned and the opportunities we have in front of us that we\u2019re working on. And with that, like to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning and best wishes to Carol and Glenn in your transitions. In terms of box shipments I was wondering if you\u2019d give us color on how those trended in the first weeks of January, and then given the outage in Pensacola, I was wondering if you could talk about how comfortable you are with your inventory levels? And if you could give any additional color on what steps you\u2019re taking in your system to meet customer needs. Tim Nicholls : Hi, Anthony. It\u2019s Tim. On box shipments, January was pretty strong for us. We don\u2019t have final numbers just yet, but absolute we think will be somewhere between 4% and 5% and roughly flat on the daily. So everything that we saw in the fourth quarter kind of continued over into January. In terms of Pensacola, obviously, first of all, we\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019ve got such a great team and we\u2019ve got such a really good manufacturing system for containerboards. So we\u2019ve got one mill down. Our inventories, I think, we had told you in the fourth quarter, were tight and we\u2019re already managing a very complicated supply chain. Having said that, we\u2019ve got tremendous flexibility in the system we have. And so we\u2019re looking at all our options as to how we accommodate the capacity that we need and make sure we keep our customers with product. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem in the first quarter. So, we\u2019re lean and we\u2019re running hard but I think we\u2019ve got a lot of options around the other 15 mills in the United States to make sure that we\u2019re meeting all of our commitments. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then regarding the first quarter outlook for Cellulose Fibers, you\u2019ve got a headwind from higher outages and some higher costs but you\u2019ve got also the Weyerhaeuser acquisition and price hikes and synergies. I guess my question is, would you expect that business to be profitable in the first quarter or maybe closer to break even following the loss in 4Q? Jean- Michel Ribi\u00e9ras : \u2013 : Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO. Mark Wilde : Good morning. First question is just, if you look at where you stand at the end of the first quarter, from a price cost standpoint in the containerboard business, the benefit of the autumn hike and then the increase and kind of costs that we\u2019ve seen over the last six to nine months, are you going to be ahead or behind where you were, say, last spring? Tim Nicholls : Hey Mark, it\u2019s Tim. We\u2019ll be behind from a margin standpoint, I think price increase, as we exit the first quarter, will probably have 85% to 90% of the price increase implemented and we expect a full realization, the offset obviously is the pressure that we\u2019ve seen with input cost. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right and then as a follow up, I just have a trade question. I just noticed that Brazil has raised its import duties on fluff pulp from 4% to 14%. It looks to me like this is an attempt to allow [indiscernible] in the kind of ramp up its new fluff pulp mill and enter the fluff market. And I just wonder from kind of a trade standpoint, is there anything you can do about this? You\u2019re the biggest pulp producer in the world and it seems like the government down there is just trying to help kind of the Brazilian producers enter this market, by kind of providing them a closed market for a little while with this tariff. Jean- Michel Ribi\u00e9ras : \u2013: Mark Wilde : Yes, I guess, my point is just \u2013 you\u2019ve tied a lot of capital up in the fluff pulp business and this is pretty clearly an attempt kind of prime the pump for some new entrance. Jean- Michel Ribi\u00e9ras : For us it\u2019s not a big market in top of that in Latin America. So, just specifically if you asked us to -- we\u2019re not expecting a big impact on the [indiscernible] So I understand on the context. But on the reality of the numbers, it\u2019s [indiscernible] a very, very small impact. Mark Wilde : Okay, great. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. I just wanted to follow up to make sure I understood, Tim, your comment that margins would be lower at the end of the quarter, going out of this quarter, than they had been last spring. That puzzled me a little bit. Maybe you could just clarify. I assume what you were talking was that the impact of the prices falling at the beginning of last year, combined with the cost inflation would offset or outweigh this single-pipe increase. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you\u2019re saying. Tim Nicholls : Yes, I think that is right, Mark. Looking at it year-over-year you remember the price was published down in January. But that had a bit of a delay as it rolled in based on contracts. There\u2019s a lot of contracts that get impacted, and then we had more favorable input cost in the first part of last year than certainly we had at the end of last year and that\u2019s continued into the first quarter of this year. Mark Weintraub : Okay. On Pensacola, just one clarification, too. Does the $50 million number you threw out there and for that matter of the way business insurance coverage would work. On the opportunity cost of tonnage that didn\u2019t get produce that you were making money on. Is that included in that 50 million and how would that get treated by insurance if at all? Glenn Landau : Again that that $50 million is an estimate and that\u2019s a greater than $50 million, but to your question, Mark, this is Glenn, yes, business interruption, lost sales, mix, freight all those factors would be covered by insurance after the deductible. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. First off congrats Carol and Glenn in your new role and Carol it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. My first question was really around your 10% EBITDA growth target mark. Was that off of a pro forma base on an apples to apple bases with Weyerhaeuser acquisition and does that account for the impact from Pensacola? Mark Sutton : Philip, hi. The 10% comment is including Weyerhaeuser, so that\u2019s one of the catalysts that I mentioned. And then the improvement in the rest of the company, those two put together, we have line of sight. I haven\u2019t factored in a big piece of Pensacola based on Glenn\u2019s comment on what we think it might end up being net, net given the insurance and all of that. But no, it was pre Pensacola and it included Weyerhaeuser. Philip Ng : But just to be clear, the 10% base, 2017 versus 2016, does the 2016 number include Weyerhaeuser on a pro forma basis, or is that just\u2026 Mark Sutton : No, it\u2019s from an actual \u2013 closed on the deal in December so we didn\u2019t have any Weyerhaeuser number in our 2016 results. So, it includes Weyerhaeuser going forward. Philip Ng : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, on your consumer packaging business, I guess, there\u2019s been some continued pricing pressure on the folding carton side of things. Can you talk about that dynamic, how you\u2019re thinking about pricing going forward and are you starting to see that stabilize in light of potentially some concerns from imports on the FPB site? Thanks guys. Cathy Slater : Hi, this is Catherine Slater. Clearly we\u2019re monitoring but this is the first year we actually have seen any meaningful decline in our ability to export, but overall with the changes we\u2019ve made internally with Riegelwood, we\u2019re very pleased with the mix we have and feel like we\u2019re very well positioned with our current footprint. And our focus will be really on what we can control which is operating wells, managing our costs and also meeting our customers expectation. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and again best wishes to Glenn and Carol. Again, thankfully that no one was injured at Pensacola, but I wanted to ask some questions around that or a question around that. Can you talk about at this juncture what the lead times would be required to restore the continuous digester back to its pre incident state? And do you expect that on an interim basis you might be able to use some of the batch digesters that you use on the fluff line to produce Containerboard? And then the related question would be, Tim, I think in answering one of the other questions, I forget who asked it, you said you should be able to fulfill customers\u2019 needs on products through the first quarter. Did that suggest that as the year progresses, if you maintain this level of progress as we get in to seasonally higher periods that you might have more challenges with that? I just want a little bit clarity on those two things. Thank you, guys. Mark Sutton : Sure, first on the first part, you know, what Glenn covered earlier is really the estimate we have at the moment. We\u2019re pretty well convinced that we will not be starting back up in the first quarter, so the start up will fall outside. We\u2019ve got more work to do only being 10 or so days in to it. George Staphos : Sure. Tim Nicholls : Now, we feel comfortable with our exact estimate, but I think as we go through the quarter, we\u2019ll know that and we\u2019ll be able to update everyone accordingly when it happens. And to your question on batch, it\u2019s not our plan. Our focus is getting the continuous digester back up and getting the line back up the way it\u2019s configured to run. In terms of customers, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think we have any expectations at this point in customers in the first quarter. A little hard not knowing exactly the estimate as we go out in to the second quarter, but at the moment I think we\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ve got any number of options in terms of how we can manage the system and we\u2019re exploring all of those and starting to put plans in place. So I\u2019m pretty confident the team is going to respond very well and I think we will be in good shape. And if anything were to change in a material way of course we would update. George Staphos : Tim, I appreciate that. If I could just ask a quick follow-on just for clarity, I mean, lead times on some of this equipment can\u2019t be three months, right, I mean, some of this would likely take a couple of quarters. Is that an inaccurate statement? Again, any color you can provide would be helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter. Tim Nicholls : Yeah, I\u2019d just say for, I think the extent of the damage we have and those pieces of equipment I can\u2019t tell you when it will happen. I know it won\u2019t happen this quarter, but we don\u2019t have any indication that it\u2019s going to be in the second half of the year that we\u2019re still working on this. I think we\u2019ve got the ability to replace the equipment that was damaged in a shorter timeframe. George Staphos : Understood; thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Just going to ask \u2013 can you give some perspective on OCC, what you think has been driving it and are you seeing any signs of leveling off or stabilization? Tim Nicholls : Hey, Gail, it\u2019s Tim. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to know. I think some of the things you\u2019d look to be the usual suspects. China demand has been stronger. We do know that during the course of the last year, there were some disruptions in Chinese internal OCC recovery because of floods and production issues and other things. So, here in the U.S., generation, [indiscernible] the issue and I know people have mentioned the impact of e-commerce and supply chain seeming more fragmented in terms of box collection recovery. I think the big question though, not knowing exactly where it will go as we leave the first quarter and go in to the second. The big question in my mind centers around China and how close they might be to practical recovery limits of internal OCC to the country. And if they are starting to bump up against that, then their OCC demand will have to be filled from other parts of the world. Gail Glazerman : Okay, and just are you seeing it in the short-term? I think there have been some reports that China prices are kind of leveling off. Is that translating in to the U.S.? Tim Nicholls : Well, we haven\u2019t seen anything as such. And you have to keep in mind, Chinese New Year and the impact. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know. There was fairly heavy buying, ahead of trends, and you\u2019ll have to see what happens when they come out of the holiday and machine starts starting up again. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And can you give us some broader perspective on demand; obviously you\u2019re seeing fourth quarter trends carry in to the first quarter but some broader perspective on what you\u2019re expecting in boxes for 2017? And maybe specifically touch on what you might be thinking about for California Ag in the short-term and medium-term just given all the weather out there? Glenn Landau : Yeah, this is Glenn Landau. Certainly, the rain has helped. There were some pretty easy comps though. So you have to keep that in mind, but we saw a strong performance in our agricultural segment in the fourth quarter. No reason to believe that it won\u2019t be strong in 2017. Just from a segment standpoint, we also saw process foods recovering. Our fourth quarter was pretty good on that front. Protein, which after coming of a couple years of issued that various segments approaching were working through. We saw the beginnings of recovery there as well. And so we\u2019re in the midst of updating models for 2017. I think everything we\u2019ve seen so far were still kind of in the 1%, 1.5% range and really haven\u2019t seen anything that would make us think it\u2019s going to be less than that. Gail Glazerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thanks, good morning and congratulations everyone. First of all on Pensacola, we understand that Containerboard is offline for the first quarter, but given the margins are better in the Containerboard. Could you run the machine slow motion with the batch digesters in the long run or is it just too much of a mismatch in machine size? Tim Nicholls : Well, I\u2019m not technical expert, but I think there\u2019d be a lot of plumbing and rerouting of things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the most efficient thing for us to do. The best thing for us to do is focus on getting the fluff line up and running. We have commitments to customers that Jean-Michel could talk about, so we\u2019re going to work on that as priority and then get the continuous digester up and running as efficiently and quickly as possible. Steve Chercover : Got it. And just my quick follow-up, we know you\u2019re about a third of the overall domestic Containerboard market. If I recall, you\u2019re about 50% of the Amazon\u2019s supply. So can you just give us a little update on just how quickly e-commerce is growing versus traditional box? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, I don\u2019t want to comment on any specific customer. We service a broad range of online and distribution customers in the space. It\u2019s growing rapidly. I would say fourth quarter I think we\u2019re up over 10% just e-commerce distribution combined and we expect that term to continue. Steve Chercover : Great, thank you, Tim. Tim Nicholls : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark Connelly : Thank you. A while back we heard a lot about the changes of postal ridge to take in to account volume. Can you tell us how that\u2019s playing out now that you\u2019ve been through a holiday season and whether you think it\u2019s going to continue to shift a lot? We\u2019re not seeing it in my house as my boxes are all coming in and they\u2019re mostly air. Mark Sutton : Mark, hi. This is Mark Sutton. We have not seen big impact. I think part of the calculus on that is the total cost of the delivery and the need \u2013 some of the online shippers to value propositions as we\u2019ll get it you quickly and there is always a trade off on labor cost and supply cost versus a little bit of waste in the box and the volume pricing. So I think markets tend to find an efficient solution and obviously I think in the future, we will have less air in the boxes, but I believe right now its trade off of postage and all the other cost it takes to pick and pack and ship and get it to customers right away. But I think any time we\u2019ve seen inefficiencies over time in a product or supply chain, you tend to sort them out. And we work on that all the time proactively. Mark Connelly : That\u2019s super helpful. And just one quick question, you mentioned the pick up in volumes in your Brazilian white paper business. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more of a sense of local demand and the supply demand balance down there. Glenn Landau : Hey, Mark, this is Glenn. Yes, the fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest quarter for Brazilian paper. What happens there is essentially that\u2019s the build for the new school year that starts in the southern hemisphere and essentially in late January after Carnival. So, it\u2019s a build for that demand pull. Net, net though it was just seasonal demand while we saw some signs of growth in the third quarter, this is going to be a slow recovery in Brazil. We\u2019re not seeing or feeling incremental demand associated with recovery at this point and I think that applies as well to packaging. So at this point in time steady, not going backwards, but no real economic driven demand growth. Mark Connelly : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, on the comment about a line of sight to 10% EBITDA growth, would you say that\u2019s the bottom end of the range of expectations you have for 2017 and if so you know what things could maybe go right that isn\u2019t in that 10% number that could drive it a little bit higher? Mark Sutton : Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t think about it as the bottom end of the range. I think it is a reasonably good line of sight to what we know now based on what we have in our economic projections what we see coming out of 2017 which has been discussed a little bit, rising Containerboard and box prices still very strong robust demand, catalyst for the Weyerhaeuser acquisition and our own internal target for improvement that aren\u2019t always commercially related. So, I would say it\u2019s more of a \u2013 as we sit here on February 2nd with a reasonable set of outlook assumption, it seems like something we have line of sight too. So maybe that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying it\u2019s a mid case but I think we feel pretty good about being able to do that, again given some of the specific catalysts we have. Brian Maguire : Okay, I appreciate the color there. Just as a follow up, just on Slide 16, you talk about some of the pro forma change in the cellulose fibers, EBITDA. We don\u2019t have the walk like we do with some of the other segments on the EBIT there, but \u2013 so I was hoping you could shed some light into what drove the decline there and kind of related to that when you acquired the Waco Weyerhaeuser pulp business. You mentioned about $350 million of EBITDA, obviously it\u2019s lower at this point, but could you give maybe an updated forecast on where that stands recognizing, of course, you\u2019ll get the $175 million of synergies on top of that, but maybe just kind of an update on where that business is now. Thanks. Jean- Michel Ribi\u00e9ras : Hi, this is Jean-Michel looking up on the Global Cellulose Fibers. Let me say that 2016 for books legacy and Weyerhaeuser was a year [indiscernible] especially from the end of 2015 that\u2019s starting to impact the contractor on the year. So that had a big impact on the result of 2016 and probably the starting point of 2017. And then we had an $18 million as you know as Riegelwood starter, so that impacted 2016. How do we see 2017? We see a good demand so far. I would say even stronger than we expected. We are seeing a strong ramp-up of the synergies. So if you take off the 350, which was the target of roughly what we had combined business, we are a little bit above that on a normal cycle I\u2019d say plus synergies. So if we take an outlook of the combined business before synergies and more on what I call a normal price environment, we are in the 350 to 400 to which I will have the synergies. So I know we have the \u2013 but we feel very comfortable we are going to get there. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Manuel : Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to Carol and welcome Glenn. Just if I could follow up a second on the last question, just to get up \u2013 not trying to pin you to forecast or things of that nature, but if I kind of think of where the run rate should be for the cellulose fluff pulp business, when we think of coming out of 2018 or in to 2019, starting with your 350- ish base and what you had in your existing business and synergies, something with kind of a 600-plus of EBITDA, is that still a reasonable target to think of? Glenn Landau : Yes, it is. That\u2019s our target actually. Chris Manuel : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. With regard to Pensacola, I kind of thinking about the mix and what you have down there that was a place where you were making some board and some fluff as it said. Having the incident, does that potentially make you to rethink what the long-term opportunity or right product to make out of that facility is? Tim Nicholls : No, this is Tim. I think we like what we have especially on the Containerboard side, the fluff pulp operation figure as well. Chris Manuel : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for questions. We do have time for one final question. It will come from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Great. Thank you and best of luck to you Carol, and good luck Glenn; good to hear your voice again. Question I had was looking at the consumer packaging business, which is I know have been kind of gradually eroding for a number of years and it\u2019s a very competitive business. Away from you, there\u2019s been more and more consolidation. And I didn\u2019t know what you thought about that, especially the last move might actually affect some of your cons given that I don\u2019t think you do much converting. And so could you just talk a little bit about how you see the strategic importance of that business and should there be any change? Cathy Slater : Chip, hi. This is Cathy. I\u2019d say that yes there is clearly been actions that we\u2019ve taken ourselves looking at what the future would look like with the change at Riegelwood, but not sure how much you\u2019re aware of that. We do actually supply a lot of our own packaging material into foodservice and we see a good customer support for that business with some really major customers. And with our other product line that leads Texarkana and Augusta facility; those are some areas that we are continuing to work to find good high volume homes for that. But at this point, like I said earlier, our focus with the change in footprint is on making sure that supply chain is healthy and able to meet the customers\u2019 needs in a safe and a way to add value back to IP. Chip Dillon : I see. I meant not converting cups. And then this last quick follow up, Glenn, do you expect to need to make, if interest rates stay where they are, would you expect to need to make another pension or would it be desirable to make another pension contribution this year or next? Glenn Landau : Well, Chip, as you know, we\u2019ll keep all our options open, but we do not have any required pension contributions in either one of the years you\u2019ve referenced, but not this year or next. Chip Dillon : I see. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to Jay Royalty for any additional or closing remarks. Jay Royalty : So, thanks, everyone. That wraps up today\u2019s call. I appreciate you joining us this morning. And as always, Michelle and I will be available after the call to answer additional questions. Our phone numbers are on Slide 26. And with that, have a great and safe day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude International Paper\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to International Paper First Quarter 2017 Earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Paula, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our first quarter call. I'm going to begin on slide five. International Paper delivered solid results in the first quarter in what was a transitional quarter with many moving parts. And quite frankly, we see the second quarter as transitional as well given the heavy maintenance outages, some additional costs at Pensacola, input costs that are expected to remain high, and ongoing implementation of previous price increases. All of these should position IP for a very strong second half. In the first quarter, price realizations were as expected, and we make several price increase announcement across our businesses. This includes a $50 per ton North American containerboard price increase effective in March, which was recognized by the publication index this past Friday. In addition to that, we have announced and are implementing price increases across North American export containerboard, market softwood and fluff pulp, and our paper business in Brazil and EMEA, as well as the price increase in Consumer Packaging. We effectively managed through a challenging situation following the January 22nd digester incident at our Pensacola mill and I'm pleased to report that the mill was back up and fully operational in early April. The integration of our newly acquired pulp business is off to a great start and we delivered $14 million in synergies in the first quarter. Input costs across all businesses were a $55 million headwind with more than half of this driven by OCC as prices increased on average about $40 a ton versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, IP received dividends from the Ilim JV in the first quarter totaling $127 million, reflecting a continued very strong year of financial performance at the JV in 2016. Moving to slide six, turning to the financial results. One area that stands out is revenue, which increased almost 8% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the addition of our newly acquired pulp business, which I would also note is a business that is growing from a demand standpoint at an annual rate of 5%. Turning to slide seven, I'd like to provide an update on the recovery at our Pensacola mill. This, as we had said in the first quarter, was a very unfortunate incident, so I'd like to take a few moments to discuss it. First and foremost, I'd like to thank our IP employees for their extraordinary job of responding to a very difficult situation both at the mill and in the surrounding community. In addition, I'd like to thank the Unified Command, which included representatives from the federal and state environmental protection agencies and the county health department for their cooperation and assistance in managing through to recovery. I think, this is a great example of what we call the IP Way Forward, which is doing the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons all at a time. It's foundational to who we are as International Paper. Within the first 48 hours following the incident, remediation teams began cleaning and repairing common areas and effected home sites. Most of this work is now complete. We took multiple steps to ensure that our customers' needs were met, including adjusting our outage schedule, shifting production to other mills, along with other mitigation efforts. Fortunately, we were able to utilize the spare digester dome, which we had on hand to expedite the repair to get the mill back up and running in the shortest time possible. As we shared publicly during the quarter, an unusual combination of naturally produced pulping gases and pressurized air led to the explosion, which occurred, an event that we've never seen before in IP and to our knowledge as we understand that never before seen in the forest product industry. We have taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again, and we have shared our findings with the industry globally and hope that a similar situation can be prevented in any other company in the future. We feel very fortunate that no one was injured in this event. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glenn and let him provide financial update on the incident. And then move into the details for the quarter. Glenn? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Continuing with Pensacola on the same slide and relative to the outlook on total financial exposure we shared during the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we see things coming in at the low end of the previously disclosed range. We now see all-in costs, including $16 million for capital coming in around $80 million. In terms of the first quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by $46 million, however, the actual financial impact in quarter one was minimized by shifting our planned maintenance outage schedule. This moved $26 million of these outages out of the quarter into the second quarter, but that's obviously more about timing. Additionally, we booked $12 million of realized and anticipated insurance recovery in the quarter. So looking forward, we remain optimistic about our ability to recover all of our out-of-pocket costs after the deductible through insurance in the calendar year. And as we've already shared, given the accounting treatment for the capital to repair the fully depreciated digester and the associated step-up in assets, we continue to see this as a nonmaterial earnings event in 2017. Now moving to our quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide eight. Notably, we saw a meaningful uplift in price versus the fourth quarter in 2016, largely driven by implementation of our announced October price increase in North America Industrial Packaging as well as other price realizations on export containerboard and some early benefits from our pulp price initiatives. Volume was, in general, seasonally lower across the majority of our businesses. Operations and costs were flat, inclusive of the cost associated with the disruption at Pensacola, while maintenance outage expenses were higher. Input costs were slightly higher driven by rapidly escalating prices for OCC throughout the quarter. Finally, contribution from newly acquired pulp business, as you can see unbundled in the bridge, was impacted by significant outage expenses in the quarter, largely associated with the unique energy savings projects completed at the Port Wentworth mill and more to come on that a little later. So, moving to the businesses on slide nine. Earnings in Industrial Packaging were lower primarily due to higher maintenance outage expenses and higher input costs, mainly OCC, as I just referenced, which together more than offset our significant price increase realizations to-date. Volume was also seasonally lower, but as expected. So stepping back, we see the first quarter as our low point or trough in business margins for this new cycle. And as the $50 per ton price \u2013 March price increases realized on containerboard and our box business, beginning in the second quarter we also see other ongoing non-price initiatives helping, we see a period of significant margin expansion ahead for this business. On slide 10, the graph shows, well, box prices in OCC indexed to the fourth quarter of 2015. As you can see, our box prices have recovered to just above the levels exiting 2015. However, given incrementally higher OCC costs, margins remained squeezed into the first quarter. With that said, our October price increase has been fully implemented and largely realized, with just some modest benefits coming outside this quarter as it flows through the remaining contracts. So looking forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, we will see the ramp-up of benefits of the March increase with the majority of the realization coming in the third and fourth quarters as it is implemented through our box contracts. As to our outlook for OCC costs, we expect continued elevated levels in the second quarter acknowledging the peak in March and \u2013 acknowledging the peak in March and a modest downward trend since, but on average, essentially flat with the first quarter. Additionally, as global markets remain strong, we expect further earnings upside in the profitability of our export linerboard sales over the balance of the year associated with both implemented and announced increases. Turning to global cellulose fibers and I'm on page 11, we experienced a transitional quarter from an earnings standpoint as contribution from a newly acquired pulp business was more than offset by heavy outages in that portion of the business mainly due to the Port Wentworth energy reduction project. A little background here, the project involved the boiler and turbine upgrades that will result in both chemical and energy savings over time. The project investment was $140 million, including $50 million of required maintenance capital and will generate solid returns above the cost of capital annual benefits of $15 million to $20 million of incremental EBITDA. Additionally, back to the quarter, we saw initial benefits from our announced price increases, although the majority of the benefits will be realized over the coming months. Synergies of $14 million were achieved in the quarter and are spread across multiple bars in the bridge. And again, just to be clear, if I could draw your attention to the portion of the bridge that's highlighted with the caption, pulp acquisition, this reflects results for that portion of the business for the first quarter as compared to the one month we owned the business in the fourth quarter. The incremental $16 million represents the underlying performance of the business outside of outage expenses, but including synergies above the $17 million earned in the fourth quarter, bringing us to roughly $33 million EBIT run rate for the acquisition business in the first quarter of 2017. I'm now on slide 12, which provides a little more perspective on our synergy plan as well as our results through the first quarter. As you can see, we're tracking synergies in three major categories : SG&A, commercial, manufacturing, supply chain. And as I said for the first quarter, we achieved $14 million in synergies split across these three categories. Notably, our annualized run rate coming out of the first quarter is $56 million, and this is ahead of our track and expectations. On the right, you can also see how the $175 million total synergy target breaks out by category. So we remain very confident regarding our synergy opportunities and our ability to meet, more importantly, exceed this commitment over time. Moving to slide 13. Printing Papers, was an uneventful quarter, primarily impacted by normal seasonality, largely in Brazil, resulting in lower volume and less favorable mix as we expected. Now on Slide 14. Our Consumer Packaging segment earnings were off versus the fourth quarter of 2016 modestly as seasonally higher operating expenses, higher input costs, and a less favorable mix more than offset lower maintenance outages in the quarter. So taking a look and stepping back at the overall SBS market on slide 15. Fundamentals have truly strengthened over the last few months. Backlogs are up 25% and operating rates improved as well. Shipments are up nearly 5% year-over-year, while inventory and trade flows have remained fairly constant. What we believe is driving the improvement in fundamentals is a combination of factors. This includes some Q1 seasonality, a general pickup in consumer-driven demand as well as an increase in demand for place (13:34) stock and potentially some pre-buying before a relatively heavy spring outage season compared to last year. Overall, foodservice demand is up 2.5% year-to-date in the U.S. and looking forward, continued improvements in labor markets, increases in hourly wages, strong consumer confidence, and increases in disposable income should lead to improved \u2013 continued improvements in SBS domestically going forward. Moving to Ilim. The JV delivered a solid quarter as higher pulp prices were more than offset by seasonally lower volume and higher wood costs. The Russian ruble strengthened during the quarter resulting in an FX gain on the JV's U.S.-denominated debt. Looking to the second quarter, the JV expects seasonally stronger volumes to be partially offset by heavy maintenance outages. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter on page 17. We expect to see, as I referenced earlier, the initial benefits of the March $50 per ton price increase in North America Industrial Packaging, along with continued realization of price increases on export containerboard, which just in quarter two together will amount to roughly a $30 million upside. We also expect to see price increase benefits from Global Cellulose Fibers of roughly $20 million in the quarter. I would also note that our price initiatives in European papers and Brazil papers both continue to move smoothly, and we see full implementation and realization there as well. For volume, we expect, and are experiencing at the moment typical seasonal increases in North American Industrial Packaging and Consumer Packaging which, together, should drive another $30 million increase in earnings across the businesses \u2013 across these businesses in Q2. Looking across our remaining business, volume is expected to be relatively stable. In operations and cost, we expect significantly less costs at Pensacola, along with some seasonal improvements in our North American packaging businesses which will result in $40 million in additional earnings. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, the non-repeat of the issues we had at Pensacola as well as post start-up costs associated with Port Wentworth represent an additional $20 million quarter-over-quarter. Maintenance outage expenses will peak in Q2, for the year are expected to be $82 million higher quarter-over-quarter. And input costs, we see as being generally flat, quick note back on outage expenses, 70% -- 75% of our annual outages will be completed for the year exiting Q2. In other items category, we listed our assumptions for corporate expense, interest expense, tax rate, and equity earnings from the Ilim JV. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Glenn. So I'm on Slide 18. So as Glenn just shared on the second quarter outlook on the previous slide, you can see on Slide 18 there's a lot of pricing activity underway across several of IP's businesses, so we thought it would be helpful to just put this in one place for you. It won't go through all the details here, but we expect these changes to translate to a step-change improvement in earnings as we move into the second half of the year. And I would also note that this is just a snapshot of where we stand at this point in time relative to what's been announced and what's in progress. On slide 19, I'll wrap-up by our comments. In addition to the pricing activity I just highlighted, we have a host of additional initiatives that set the stage for a particularly strong second half, and importantly, continued momentum as we exit 2017 and go into 2018. These include operational and cost-savings initiatives across all of the businesses, significantly lower maintenance outages expenses in the second half and, as Glenn just outlined with 75% of those being behind us after Q2. And accelerating benefits from the integration in Global Cellulose Fibers business as well as the start-up of the converted Madrid mill on high-performance recycled containerboard which will be for internal consumption by our European box business. We will continue to focus on allocating capital to create value with a near-term focus, as I mentioned on the last quarter's call, on debt reduction. So with all this being said, I'm highly confident that IP can deliver year-over-year EBITDA growth with material upside to the 10% target we shared on our last earnings call. And with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operating Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you for taking my call. Just first question I want to ask was, as I look through slide 10, just to make sure I understand this right. This sort of suggest that you've got about 3% realization of box prices as I sit today during 1Q. I mean, perhaps could you give us a sense of what the exit rate look like, I'm guessing it was probably closer to a 6%, 7% sort of range instead. And then that's again, not still inclusive of what you've got going forward with the current round of stuff that probably is another directionally 10% on top of that. So some color there will be helpful. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yes Chris, it's Tim. We did end stronger in March as we went through the quarter. And you'll remember that in the fourth quarter, the price have already started moving up. So as we exited the first quarter, we were roughly 85%, 90% realized on the price increase from the fall. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, so the kind of 3% that you've got there is what you think you're going to get out of the first piece? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: There's a little bit more to come as we go through the second quarter, just in terms of how contracts work. But we're right on track where we thought we were going to be. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. The follow-up question I had also in relation to the box business. When I look further in the back, it look like your volumes were down just a tick under 1%. I think industry numbers through the first quarter were up 2% to 3% depending on what you looked at. I do appreciate you had an outage, is there anything \u2013 how should we think about that, is it just perhaps customers kind of source from other folks in the near run while they knew you were having some issues and it kind of comes back towards market as the year progresses or do you feel you had any share losses or how would we think about that? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I'm sorry, Chris. I guess the first part of your question, you're talking about box volume? Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, in the back slide that showed down 0.7% through the quarter, I think the industry was up 2% to 3%. Just helping me put that together. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yes, I mean, we look at it on an ongoing basis and there's noise in the quarter, right. So we had some exposure to our ag position given the heavy rains and the delay in crops. We also saw some weakness in beverage. I don't think it's a trend. I think that you're going to see noise quarter-to-quarter. Especially with us. I mean, our focus is on managing margins at the end of the day. We're going to have some segment exposure from time to time, but over time we expect to grow in line with market. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Good luck guys. Operator : Your next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call and the details. If we could talk at all about what kind of run rate you're seeing, recognizing it's early in the quarter, during 2Q. Within the containerboard and box system, but also across your other businesses, that's my first question. And then secondly, I was just trying to do some quick math on your heat map chart and considering also the slight or a decline in Ilim sequentially. Should we ballpark the expecting sort of flat to slightly up in terms of earnings for 2Q versus 1Q, is that the correct takeaway, or did we miss something here? Thank you guys. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hey George, its Tim. I'll start on the demand side. We continue to see really strong demand on the export side. In fact, our customers have been frustrated, but highly appreciative of the way that we work through the Pensacola incident in terms of being transparent with them and really working hard to cover their needs. And our demand in the second quarter will grow. On the box side through April, it looks like we're trending close to 2% on a daily and still working through some of the Ag that is beginning to pick up and some of the other segment exposures that we have. We feel really good about box demand so far. In fact, I think our view on the year total market is we're anticipating growth on a daily between 1.5% to 2%, probably closer to 2%. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hi, George, this is Glenn responding to the heat map question and the direction for the second quarter. Yeah, I think, you're directionally correct. As Mark said, the second quarter is also another transitional quarter, but it's more than just flat. There's upside in the second quarter as we really go into the very, very strong second half. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, this is Mark. Just to finish your demand question. I mentioned it in my remarks that strong demand plus 5% in our Cellulose Fibers business and we see that continuing. We've got a great customer list, and so we're well positioned geographically as well as with individual accounts. We're seeing some strength in the part of Consumer Packaging markets that we participate in. And over in Europe, our packaging business demand is solid. Paper is a similar story to what it has been, but it's not different than what we thought, still declining in the developed markets, but we do see some growth in Brazil. And, again, Brazil has tremendously powerful export position, so we serve multiple markets. So I would say our view of demand across our products gets to some of the comments I made about good, strong business fundamentals, solid activity on the pricing front and the internal initiatives we have around cost savings and how we manage outages this year, all set us up very well for a really exciting second half. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tim, one on e-commerce. I would have thought you'd have been a big beneficiary of e-commerce growth in the quarter, but obviously, your volume was down close to 1%. Can you talk about how much you're actually benefiting from e-commerce on the volume side as well as what impact you think e-commerce is having both on OCC costs as well as your price/mix? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I mean, some of this is speculative, right, because we only have our view. But I think e-commerce is growing more rapidly and will continue to grow more rapidly than brick-and-mortar. And I don't know where that stops. They're penetrating in a lot of areas. We had a very good quarter in the first quarter with e-commerce. But compared to prior years, you go through the holiday season and then as you hit January, there's always a return period and there's promotions. And that part felt a little bit lighter this year, maybe people did a better job buying the right-size products through the holidays. On the OCC front, I do believe that it is beginning to have an impact in terms of fiber flows and recovery. I just don't know how much and I don't know how far it goes. But it does feel like just given how much is being purchased online, that it is skewing OCC availability, at least at certain times of the year. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And then just one on the box price increase, how would you characterize the fall ball box price increase implementation? And how do you think the spring box price implementation \u2013 increased implementation will differ, if at all, from the fall implementation? Thank you very much. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I'm very positive on the spring price implementation. I think we see our supply chain has been very tight, now part of that is Pensacola. But we ran at what were historically low inventory levels in the first quarter and did a lot of scrambling quite frankly, just to try to keep up as much as we could. I think box demand has been good, and so we look at it, and we see a normal type of implementation as we work through all of the conversations with our customers. And the bulk of it will start in the second quarter, the bulk of it will come in the third, and there will be a little tail as we go into the fourth quarter. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Go to next question... Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. With all the price action, I appreciate the slide, page 18. And just wanted to maybe flush out a little bit if possible. So how much fluff pulp versus NBSK, SBSK would annual production be roughly? Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: So, we are \u2013 hi, Jean-Michel speaking. Good morning, Mark. We are roughly 2 million tons, a bit more, 2.2 million tons on fluff and 800,000 tons on market pulp to-date, with the proportion going up in fluff and specialty and have (28:12) specialty with fluff in Consumer Products. (28:15) specialty. So on the mix, which is one of the big initiative we're having around fluff and specialty is growing. Ultimately I think we'll probably be 2.3 million tons, 2.4 million tons plus specialty versus 600,000 tons on market pulp net short and that's the (28:33) target. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And on the slide on page 18, it notes that there's $115 per ton of announced and published price initiatives on fluff. How should one think about how these increases tend to get put in, and how they tend to stays in over time? Is it fairly immediate, or is it that it does take a while because of the way contracts are set up for it to show up on the bottom line? Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: So let me back up two seconds and then answer your question. You have to be fair what is SBSK, NBSKs and fluff. SBSK and NBSK is relatively fast, it's not immediate, but between the announcement and the realization, you might have 30 days, max 60 days. On the contract side, on the fluff side, you really have a mix. You have a mix of regions where they're not indexed based; you have a mix of businesses, which are indexed based; and then even on the comp size based, sometimes they're very long before they're realized. So between the time we announce and realization, there is a delay, I would say, no that was the dynamic we've had on different announcements, I'm quite positive we're going to start this quarter to see the impact significantly. So there is a delay. It varies with the product, it varies with the customers, the regions. But we are on a really good track. Two have been published by index already. We have two more prices, which we have seen action on the non-indexed contracts. So I'm quite confident we're going this way. So it takes time, but we're getting there. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Yeah, hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Doing well. Good morning. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : So first of all, just to continue on the fluff pulp. Can just you provide a little bit of color in your customer base, is it very concentrated? Is there a number for your top three or top five customer accounts that you can provide as a percentage of your sales? Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: I think we are \u2013 our mix is roughly like the market. So we have the top 10 customers in this market are important, it represents maybe 45% to 50%. Our top 10 must be 45% to 50%, and the other is 50% of our sales are many, many customers around the world. So we are more or less aligned with the market. I would say, the new mix we had will be a little bit more aligned with big customers and (31:33) so now the combination is roughly perfectly aligned with the market, even in terms of regional sales if you look at it. It's kind of almost to the percentage aligned with the market. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : That makes a little sense. And just as a follow-up. Switching gears to the Ilim joint venture, we've noticed that you've been shifting the debt from U.S. dollars to rubles, and can you explain a little bit the rationale? Is it to smooth out your EPS? Or is there any other reason behind that shift? Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: Jean-Michel speaking again. We wanted to kind of naturally address Ilim, so we kind of had one third rubles, two-third \u2013 we're not trying to be all rubles or all U.S. dollars. As you know, we sell a lot in dollars, so the pulp is sold in dollars. So by adding a debt of this content that allows us to not depend so much about FX situation and be much more naturally hedged. So that was the reason we did it, and we don't have intention to make bigger the move. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Scott. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just going back to slide 32 where you had the box shipments for the quarter. You noted the $22 of price/mix per ton sequentially from the fourth quarter, obviously, you got some of the benefits of the $40 increase in the fourth quarter. Is there anything on the mix side of the business that's holding back some of the realization from that price increase? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, we had a few dollars of negative mix just across segments in the first quarter relative to the fourth, roughly about $4 of \u2013 just in terms of customers and segments and the types of boxes that they buy. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Not structural? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No, not structural, I mean, our mix just based on segments and how people buy fluctuates all the time. It can move positive or negatively a few dollars quarter-by-quarter. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I mean, is there a way to sort of characterize the type of product or customer that would cause those temporary mix issues? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: It's all over the map. It depends on board construction, it depends on box style. It just depends on a lot of factors. So in a word, no. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: We understand it. We look at it. We do a lot of detailed analysis about it, but there's nothing that kind of repeat itself over and over again. It just depends on demand across the segments. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then Mark, I thought I heard you mention earlier on the Consumer Packaging segment that you might have had some pre-buy, I think I heard that correctly. If so, where are you seeing that and sort of how should we think about the impact as move into the second quarter? Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.: So this is Cathy Slater. Really, what we can say from the takeaway from our facilities that we saw higher shipping this quarter versus the same time last year. And we know that we have outages and kind of all of our customers know that as well in the second quarter. And so really, we just continue to see the takeaway that occurred and we're really just speculating as to what our customers may have chosen to do to cover that. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Last one for me. Earlier this week RISI put out a notice that they're delaying the implementation of the recycled containerboard price index. And I think they're evaluating a more objective price index, which looks like it's across many different grades. How should we think about that? Or what are your thoughts on that so far as to what you're seeing? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hi, it's Tim. I mean, we're waiting to see exactly what they're going to do. I think they're proposing that they run a pilot of some type. I mean, our view would be, no index is perfect but the one that we have has worked well over time. There's moments of dislocation, probably up and down but on balance, we think it worked well over its history. I guess, we would want to understand what the changes are going to be and if objective means, a practice of submitting data, we would really be concerned about making sure it passes regulatory muster. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hi guys. Pulp prices really have firmed up in the last few months across the spectrum globally. Just curious, how sustainable is that just given some of the passes (36:45) that's coming on later, but obviously, we appreciate the 5% growth that you're seeing in the market? Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: Hi. Jean-Michel speaking again. Like Tim, I cannot stipulate for the market, but if you look from our customer standpoint, the demand is very strong, and it's very strong not only in short-term. You know we have a long-term contract, so a lot of our sales are done three, six months in advance which forecast on our customers. And we're seeing a lot of growth. One of the potential driver, and I'm sure it's not the only one, it's Asia, I think, there's a clear relation between consumer not the whole GDP, the specific consumer growth in Asia in terms of purchasing power, in terms of demand. And this is impacting a lot of purchase of goods, which indirectly impact either SBSK or fluff because those are medical hygiene goods which we know they have a direct relation with the purchasing power. So I think there is a trend on developing countries, which are getting not only growth of economy, but growth of purchasing power people, which is creating an incremental demand. So we think the demand more solid than we expected. So I'm recognizing that in some grade, not specifically fluff, in some grade there's going to be some new capacity coming. But if the demand continues to be as good and if some of the indicators we're seeing are continuing like they are, we're feeling good about it. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : That's helpful. I guess, due to the weather in the West Coast, Ag was under pressure in the quarter for your Corrugated Packaging business. With things clearing up a bit, should we expect IP potentially outpacing the broader market since I believe you're more exposed to Ag versus some of your competitors and how should we think about mix from that type of the \u2013 from the Ag business? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, I mean we're expecting a good quarter. Agriculture is an important segment for us. We are a bit disproportionately weighted to it. We did have a drag in the first quarter based on weather in terms of harvest and just timing on planting of row crops and whatnot. So we'll get a crop in the second quarter. I don't know how it'll compare to others, but we have a big exposure and we're expecting a big quarter. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one for me, SBS actually soften a little bit in the fourth quarter, and we've seen a nice bounce back. Any concern that this is kind of inventory restock? And just curious, can you provide some color where you're seeing strength in SBS, any market, in particular? Thanks. Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.: This is Cathy again, so just I guess, what I've said, where we're seeing strength is where we are good, which is in foodservice. And as Glenn already commented, as people are seeing improvement in wages and are on-the-go society where people are wanting to grab something quick and get a coffee, we're seeing some good strength there. Overall though, I'd like say through this year, the backlogs have increased significantly whereas backlogs now that we haven't seen since 2014, so pretty good confidence about the strength of that price increase. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Debbie. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I wanted to ask about how you feel that the overall kind of portfolio of businesses that you have today. I think in the past we've talked about some optionality around consumer in LatAm and potentially some of those might be at a bit of an inflection point here. So, I just was hoping you could comment overall and then specifically on those two units? And for lastly, I'm referring to corrugated. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Debbie, it's Mark. Great question. We're always looking at ways to build the best International Paper we can. We described at a high-level, our strategic framework as building competitive advantage positions in attractive markets. And we believe we're making a lot of progress on them when you look at the businesses we have. The two you mentioned, they're still work in process. Cathy, just mentioned the part of Consumer that we're really, really competitive in, and we like integrated forward through foodservice converting, we're continuing to improve. And we're continuing to evaluate options for whether we can actually build and should build a competitive advantage position in the right markets in Consumer Packaging. And those types of evaluations take some time, but the core focus right now is improving what we have. And that's what we're doing. On corrugated in Latin America, it's along the same lines. We look at our corrugated packaging business, and you've heard me say this before, somewhat globally as we think about containerboard and its channel to market, we want to understand all markets that we should and could be a value creating player. And so the standalone business we have in Latin America, we acquired it and sailed into the deepest recession Brazil has seen in modern history. And we have improved the business a lot, but with demand being negative, significantly negative tracking GDP, we haven't really seen the business perform in a more normalized market. So, again, working on internal improvements and we'll assess it. I mean, Industrial Packaging and corrugated is core to the company, and we'd like to see what we can do in the major markets of the world. We've been in Brazil in paper. We know the country and the economy. We believe Brazil will improve. And in the first quarter, our box business in Brazil was up over 6% against the market at about 5%. So a lot of the work we've put into establishing the right relationships with the right customers is starting to pay off. So we still believe that business has some potential inside of IP, but we are continuously looking at ways to improve the company and the value that we create. And all of our businesses and subparts of the businesses are part of that strategic evaluation and I think that's healthy for a company to do that. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question, just switching gears a little bit. I won't ask a Trump question, but there have been some changes at the EPA. And I think in the past the industry, it felt like some of the regulation or evaluation was a bit too narrow. And I just wanted to get your sense because I know you follow things going on there, what changes or things that could happen under the new administration that could be beneficial or maybe potentially worse for the industry kind of as we sit here today? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think our view, Debbie, on regulatory issues is that's not the primary issue for a company like International Paper, it definitely matters. But the biggest issue that we try to work on and that we see benefit is things that can improve the economy, which then improves demand for our products, but specifically for things like regulatory issues. The number one issue that we've been working on as International Paper is really the way that we construct our business model where we take renewable national resources and we convert them into products that are consumer-oriented products. In doing that, we generate 75% of our own energy from carbon-neutral biomass, and that is a tremendously powerful business model. And the work we've been doing with the EPA, both legislatively and directly with the agency for a while is to have a clear outcome on the recognition that wood-based biomass energy is carbon-neutral. So whatever we do in the future as a nation on carbon, we're recognized for the role we're playing, which is a powerful business model. It helps the overall balance, fossil fuel and non-fossil fuel. So that's the key issue that every time I'm in Washington and talking about regulatory issues with the EPA and anyone else, that's the issue that we talk about from our company and from our industry standpoint. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Chercover of Davidson. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: So I had a quick question on your OCC forecast, which is flat versus Q1. One of your peers suggested that Q2 average would be higher. So I'm wondering if you expect prices to decline or maybe you're just better at procurement? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Or what we had in inventory, right, as you consume it. So, I mean, we're up slightly. We stay flat, it's within a few dollars on average quarter-to-quarter. We see it pretty stable right now. So I don't expect any dramatic changes, no. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: But Steve, we are good at procurement as every...Thank you for that. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Sure. And \u2013 well, Jean-Michel just answered one of my questions on pulp, so the other one is kind of just I suppose easy. The Madrid start up is one of your, I guess, benefits for a very strong second half. And I'm just wondering, are there start-up costs that are incorporated and still going to be accretive? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think the best way, Steve, to think about Madrid is it's happening in the fourth quarter in terms of the conversion from newsprint to actually making and integrating in containerboard. It's a catalyst for 2018. The biggest drivers for the second half of 2017 are the ones we've pointed out in our remarks, around the core businesses, and the pricing, and the internal initiatives and the fact that 75% of our outages will be behind us after the second quarter. But we'll see a benefit in the quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter for that conversion, and then it will really help the European packaging business for the full year of 2018. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. How are you? Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good. Listen, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about kind of supply-demand in the domestic uncoated freesheet business. I mean we're running at about 90% operating rate, demand is easing. How do you see this kind of playing out? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think at a strategic level, we see the end-use demand drivers as continuing along the recent track, so that's in that kind of minus 3-ish, minus 3% to 5% depending on what your exposure is to roll-based products versus cut size. We're actually continuing to have for a while doing a little bit better than that. And it has to do just with the customer alignment and the mix of products. International Paper still believes in the value of branded products in some of those end-use markets, especially cut size and we still see a benefit from that as our customers \u2013 in the way they present their total package to the market, probably the brands help them play a differentiated role. And we obviously tried, as everyone does, to align ourselves up with the winning customers. So all that net-net in a market that's declined I think in the first quarter about 4%, we're down about half of that. So I don't see any major changes. I think it puts a premium on commercial excellence, supply chain performance, and in our case, we still believe in brands. We've lowered our cost structure enough to be competitive in certain markets for certain products in exports, so we have a few \u2013 a little bit more export than we had before. And again, I think that's something that we like the footprint we have and the assets, we're down to just a few mills, they're excellent at what they do and our commercial teams are top class. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And just to kind of tie that together with the containerboard business where we've got a high operating rate, we've been running kind of 96%, 97%. There's really not much capacity in the pipeline here in North America. I just wondered, is there a point here where you might think about sort of a conversion at some place like Eastover or down in Selma similar to what happened down in Pensacola? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So Mark, that's a great question. And I've said this publicly in the past that when I think about what we have in terms of our assets and our workforce, we have the ability in a number of our facilities to make a different product tomorrow than we make today, primarily because of the workforce quality and the asset configuration and access to fiber. So yes, there are a couple of our uncoated freesheet operations that in the future could be candidates to make other products and obviously, packaging would be an obvious one. But we'd do only do that if that help to improve our business and create a significant value. And I talked about our Printing Papers business as being well managed and adding that business, lacking a real better option gives us optionality on a number of fronts. So we think about it all the time, and we think about the value of kraftliner long term and whether the world and our customers need more kraftliner, IP very well positioned uniquely in some ways to be able to act on that if necessary. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then last one I had, is it possible to talk about sort of what two or three kind of main fixes would be down at Orsa? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I'll talk about one, plus 4% GDP versus minus 4%. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And then two, we've got a partially integrated system with kraftliner and recycled liner and really figuring out the mill side of that business. We don't have the best-in-class assets on the paper side. So creating a more \u2013 or deciding a different business model, for example. And then I think, third would be to continue, and we're making a lot of progress on this one, continue to restructure the customer portfolio in the segment. We were, in some ways, playing in places that we weren't competitively advantaged and the reason we're doing better than the market right now is because we decided to try to serve people with better advantage than. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Mark. Good luck in the second quarter and than in that second half. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Hey, good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Tim, I guess, the 1.5% to 2% box volume growth is up a little bit than I think what you mentioned in the last few calls. I'm just wondering if you can give \u2013 if there's any specific part of the market that's kind of driving that confidence? Any color there? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I mean, the way we model it, we don't model it out segment-by-segment. We obviously know which ones have been performing better over time, like e-commerce and distribution, and protein and we expect Ag will come back. So the way we model the market on an annual basis has a variety of factors. Nondurable goods production is only one of them, we think there's other things that drive demand. And we finished stronger in the fourth quarter last year and when we reran the numbers based on economic projections across different segments of the economy, it's looking like 2017 is going to be stronger by a fair amount than 2016 was. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Switching gear, the Ilim dividend was obviously a lot larger than what you even expected on the last earnings conference call, a lot larger than what you've received over the last few years. I'm just wondering if you can give some insight. Do you think this level is sustainable? Is there any kind of pending major claim on cash at Ilim in terms of projects that might be coming up? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Gail, the Ilim dividend of more than $100 million, is in the range that we talked about seeing the potential of this being $100 million a year dividend and it's starting to come to fruition. There is a strategic plan for llim and our view of Ilim is, there's tremendous potential with that business. And over some period of time, along with our partners in Russia, is looking at building out the full potential of that business in two kind of the ways. One is for domestic and regional markets, and then the other is as Jean-Michel mentioned earlier, serving the softwood fiber needs of the greater Asian market, namely China. So there is more potential in that business. It's not out of runway. But the dividend generation that you saw in this particular payout is very sustainable, and we expected it to get to this level and we are generating the kind of EBITDA and performance that should allow this dividend to remain strong. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Armstrong of Armstrong Investments. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, James. Unknown Speaker : The first one I have is actually about inventories in the containerboard. You mentioned that they are pretty low. Do you see any risk of inventories becoming too tight during the maintenance season? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I speak for us, I mean, yeah, we scrambled in the first quarter and we're going to continue to work pretty hard in the second quarter, even with Pensacola back up, the supply chain is pretty long, especially if you think about export. And as I mentioned, we've seen good demand from basically all regions for our export business. So we've got a large flexible system that when we run it well, we run it really well. But we're recovering from, as I said, record low levels of inventory in the first quarter. But we manage a pretty tight system all the time. We saw our inventories go down last year, just because of supply chain effects and logistics being easier to manage. So we stay close to it all the time, and we try to make sure that quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month, we're balancing appropriately to our demand signal and what we see in all three channels that we serve. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: James, if I could add to Tim's point, and the absolute inventory numbers are very visible and very important in our industry. But it's really important the point Tim made about the inventory against the backdrop of transportation network. Sometimes, it takes more inventory because of the supply-demand balance and transportation to perform in the same way that you could perform in a lot lower inventory with huge velocity improvements which, Tim mentioned, we saw at some point last year in the trucking industry. So it really is inventory against the relative environment on transportation. And that whole analysis is what our supply chain tech systems and our IT systems monitor so we can confidently take our inventories to levels that look really, really low in a particular period of time, but may be against a really efficient transportation network. And I would imagine that that's going to continue to be a challenge. And if the economy improves, which we would love to see happen, it's going to put some early stress on transportation and our supply chain team will respond accordingly with customer service and building the right margin structure as the number one objective. Unknown Speaker : That's exactly what I was looking for. Switching gears a little. I know this is an impossible question, but what are you seeing in terms of China and OCC? Did do you see any inventory build as prices ran up? And do you think the \u2013 they're going to stay out of the market for an extended period of time? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, I have no way of knowing what they'll do because I can't read minds, but it seems like it stabilized. This new program of National Sword that's going to ramp up in June, I think, will likely cause some volatility. We don't think it's targeted toward OCC as pure OCC grade. We do think that it could have an impact on mix paper, even though we think it'll be broader than that and then also pick up plastics and whatnot. But I see OCC pretty stable as we said in the second quarter. And I think it's going to be elevated for the whole year the way it's looking right now. Unknown Speaker : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from Paul Quinn of International Paper (sic) [RBC]. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Welcome to the company, Paul. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: When should I expect my first check. Thanks for taking the call, and sorry, but we'll see whether you've asked this question, or whether you've been asked this question before, but we got three conference calls at the same time, I've only got two ears here. So the question was around pulp and I see \u2013 so what I'm looking for is a comment on realizations, a comment on volume, and a comment on your Ilim forecast. So when I look at Global Cellulose Fibers, that price mix was down $27 a ton quarter-over-quarter, but Ilim's price mix was up $22, just wondering why one is lagging when one is pro? And then when I look at the Ilim volumes, they were down 24% quarter-over-quarter which was huge and just wondering what you're expecting in Q2? And then just on the Ilim forecast, you did $50 million in Q1, you're forecasting $40 million, but with the price increases, it looks like $40 million would be an easy layup. So I'm just wondering if you've got a lot of maintenance at Ilim in Q2? Thanks. Jean-Michel Ribieras - International Paper Co.: So let me take the first one I think on the pricing. The pricing we show is really a mix of region, products. So sometimes, the comparison from one quarter to another is a little bit difficult. So we'll say you have a greater mix of (1:00:12) in the first Q than we normally have due to the outages. So because of all these outages, we could not sell the \u2013 we sold more than last year, but not much as we wanted to. So I think it impacted prices in the midsized. Then you have contracts which are negotiated kind of in 2016 which took effect beginning of 2017 before the announcement of the price increase, so I think those impacted to the Q1 prices. So that was, I would say, mostly temporary. If the markets have not gone up, it could have stayed like this but with the price announcement we've made and the realization we're seeing, you see our prices gone back to what they were and even above that. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Relative to the volume side of the equation, this is Glenn and I think I said earlier, clearly, the first quarter for Ilim is seasonally slow. And it was impacted by that significantly. We did have a big FX gain that helped buffer that exposure in the first quarter. It will improve seasonally in the second quarter. In the second quarter we had even higher outages, which then offset some of that. So that basically ties out the month-to-month \u2013 the quarter-to-quarter view on volume. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks very much. Best of luck guys. Operator : Your final question comes from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you called out earlier a little bit of a less favorable mix in consumer. I just wondered if I could get a little bit more color on what was driving that and what the outlook is for mix there? Catherine I. Slater - International Paper Co.: Okay. Well, looking at \u2013 this is Cathy Slater, hello. So in the mix, the comparison that we have of what we saw as a bit of a hurt was that we had lower aseptic volume, but we do have a lot stronger slate and cut volume that we're seeing, and that's where we feel good. So that's really what the differences are there. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And just one last one. Just any thoughts on cash contribution to the pension through the year? And just kind of thoughts on the trade-off of whether you want to make any contributions? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It's a good question. This is Glenn speaking. Obviously, as we stated earlier, given the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser and the leveraged up condition of our balance sheet, clearly, this year is about debt reduction. And we put the pension in that bucket. So we'll look at our options relative to reducing debt directly or contributing to the pension and make a decision along the way which one is optimal for us this year. So it's definitely in line of sight. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Jay Royalty for any additional or closing remarks. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: So thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join the call this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call and our numbers are on slide 20 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2017 International Paper Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Jay Royalty, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Jay, and I had my thanks to everyone calling in for our call. We appreciate your interest in International Paper. Starting off on slide 5, the transitional quarter that I spoke about on the last call came in as we expected. International Paper delivered solid results overall, driven by Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers. In our Industrial Packaging business, favorable market conditions and healthy demand underpinned the solid quarter. Results in Global Cellulose Fibers were driven by strong global demand along with record fluff pulp sales, favorable pricing trends and synergies which are being realized in a faster rate than originally conveyed. The recent price increases are coming in as we expected with most of the benefits coming in the second half of the year. OCC with the greater headwind than we had originally expected, driven by stronger global demand. We successfully executed our heavy maintenance outage schedule in the second quarter and as we sit here today about 75% of our planned maintenance outages were completed in the first half of the year. The Ilim joint venture delivered another strong quarter of operational EBITDA. However, IP's equity earnings were negatively impacted by a non-cash FX charge related to this joint venture's U.S. dollar denominated net debt. All in all, we finished the second quarter as we expected and we're well positioned for a very strong second half. On slide 6 and continuing with the financials, I would like to point out a couple of key metrics. First, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was 9%. This was driven by the pulp acquisition, overall volume growth in our businesses and increased pricing in several of our businesses. You can also see the negative $0.04 impact of ruble that I mentioned earlier in the quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss each of our business segment's results and our outlook. Glenn? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yes. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 7, which is the overall enterprise bridge from the first quarter to the second quarter. So starting from the left to right, price improvement in the quarter was significant, driven by North American Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers. Volume was seasonally stronger as expected. Operations and other costs improved quarter-over-quarter and maintenance outage expenses were significantly higher again as we planned. Input costs in aggregate were a modest headwind as higher OCC up $24 million quarter-over-quarter were largely offset by lower wood, chemicals and energy costs. Corporate expenses were lower and the effective tax rate was more favorable due to the benefit of the catch up of a state tax rate change. And lastly, as Mark already noted, earnings contribution from the Ilim JV were a headwind this past quarter, this was driven by a non-cash FX charge on their U.S. denominated debt although somewhat offset by solid operations. Now, turning to the businesses and beginning with Industrial Packaging, earnings were higher driven by seasonally stronger as well as higher underlying demand along with improving prices in North American domestic and export containerboard markets, and of course North American box. As these price increases continue to ramp up, we will see the majority of the benefits hit in the second half of 2017. Operations and other cost improved but were negatively impacted by cost associated with Tropical Storm Cindy, a few isolated reliability events in the quarter and higher LIFO inventory reevaluation charges primarily related to increasing prices. I would also note that IP receives $13 million in insurance proceeds related to the Pensacola incident in the quarter, which is roughly the same as those received in the prior quarters. Input costs in the second quarter were higher, driven by OCC that was up roughly $20 per ton on average quarter-over-quarter. And lastly, closing up the first half, we successfully executed our heaviest planned maintenance quarters with nearly 70% of our maintenance outages behind us for the year. So moving to slide 9 and taking a look at our history in North America and the portion of our Industrial Packaging business, we are entering a period of significant market expansion in the second half of this year as our price and cost initiatives continue to be realized. The takeaway here is simple, this is a business that's resilient and able to relatively consistently deliver value across a broad range of economic conditions. The key drivers of this large improvement in the second half includes good growth, driven by both domestic and export demand, increasing prices in North America and also on exports, lower maintenance outages especially in this period and ongoing cost reduction initiative. So with that said, we are returning to peak historical margins in the face of higher input costs, which point to a healthy and growing global market environment and ultimately sets us up for an excellent run rate going into 2018. Turning to slide 10, I'd also want to take a moment to highlight the current state of our kraft linerboard exports from North America. As we talked about often, our export channels for kraft linerboard out of the US network are strategic for IP and provide us with many options to fully capture the value of our total containerboard system. Drawing your attention to the chart, we predominantly serve the globe's kraft linerboard needs in three regions; Latin America, Southern Europe and Asia. As you can see, global demand growth for kraftliner continues to be robust in 2017, up 3% to 4%. Further pricing trends have been favorable in all the regions and we expect that momentum to continue, which is another key driver enabling us to restore margins into the mid-20% level. Moving to slide 11, I wanted to briefly highlight an attractive acquisition that we recently closed in Morroco. We purchased Europac's Tangier facility, which was only recently started up in 2016, so quite modern facility. With this acquisition, IP received a very solid set of assets and an attractive portfolio of customers that are a great complement to IP's existing EMEA packaging business and customer base. This acquisition allows for significant optimization and growth opportunities and again, underlines our commitment to the region. I can share that we are off to a great start in the first month of ownership. Now turning to Global Cellulose Fibers, lots of green on this chart, coming off a transitional quarter in Q1, the business turned in very solid performance across the board. Earnings improved by $63 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased prices, improved mix, solid operational performance, and greater synergy benefits. The business saw a record fluff pulp volume and continue to grow within the Specialty Products segment. All in, with consideration of a light outage month in June, we exited the second quarter with EBITDA margins north of 20%. Going a bit deeper on synergies on slide 13, we delivered $34 million of synergies to the bottom line in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $48 million and approaching quickly our full-year target for 2017. Further, we exited the second quarter at an annualized rate of $126 million, well ahead of our full-year run rate target of $100 million. This gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to meet and ultimately beat the original $175 million synergy target and get there more quickly than we originally thought. This alone is really another key driver to our year-over-year improvement. On slide 14, moving to Printing Papers, financial results came in largely as expected as earnings were modestly lower due to heavy planned maintenance outages which were partially offset by higher volume out of Brazil mostly export and Europe. Slightly lower pricing and less favorable mix in North America was also largely offset by the increased prices in Europe. Turning to slide 15 and the Consumer Packaging business, results were significantly lower in the second quarter, much of which was driven by a significant planned outage expense of about $30 million predominantly at our Augusta Georgia Mill. As is typical to our initial inspections at the start of any outage, we identified at Augusta incremental opportunities for maintenance and we made the decision to extend the outages to perform additional work on the boiler. Coming out of the outage, we also incurred more costs associated with the start-up. But these events are behind us, and we expect normal operations from this point forward. Commercially, results in the quarter were solid. Pricing improved as implementation of the recent price increases continued, and we continue to see the underlying drivers of demand improve as we experience increased backlog, although much of this upside was delayed in the quarter by production constraints at Augusta. So, now on page 16, moving to Ilim, the JV delivered a very solid quarter of results, driven by seasonally higher volume and improved pulp pricing. However, as we've said a couple of times already, the equity earnings were negatively impacted by a non-cash balance sheet charge related to FX, as I discussed earlier. Looking ahead, the JV expects seasonally lower volume and lower average pulp prices to impact earnings for the third quarter. Equity earnings are projected to be $35 million assuming no change in FX from the second quarter equity raise. We're now on page 17 which is our third quarter outlook. Turning to it, we expect to see significant benefits associated with the execution of the March $50 per ton North America containerboard and box price increases, along with continued price realization on North America containerboard exports, as well as benefits from ongoing implementation of price increases in Consumer Packaging. With all combined, should improve earnings by about $80 million quarter-over-quarter. And additionally in the price/mix section, continued benefits from the pulp price increases, partially offset by seasonality and the recent dip in softwood pulp prices, will drive a net benefit to our Global Cellulose Fiber business of roughly $10 million. And in North American Papers where demand is softer, mix is expected to be a modest headwind due to a higher percentage of export shipments. Moving to volume, while we expect demand to stay strong for boxes, we will be unfavorably impacted by one less shipping day. In terms of operational performance and costs, we expected Industrial Packaging to improve $40 million quarter-over-quarter. This is due to lower operating costs and lower LIFO charges. Operational costs are expected to be lower in Consumer Packaging as well as we pass the impact from the extended outage in Augusta, and that's now behind us. So, net-net, this represents an improvement in earnings in Consumer of about $10 million. As we discussed earlier, outage expenses are scheduled to be lower by $165 million across the enterprise while input costs, driven primarily by OCC and energy, are expected to be higher by about $25 million. In the Other Items category, we have provided our assumptions for corporate expense, interest expenses, tax rate and equity earnings from the Ilim JV. So, now let me turn the call back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Glenn. You've all heard and talk about the strong second half that we envisioned in front of us, and as we sit here today, it's now upon us. International Paper is positioned for margin expansion over the balance of the year, which also should set us up very nicely as we move into 2018. There are several drivers of this step change in results, a healthy demand outlook, particularly for our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses, the realization of recent price increases across many of our IP businesses, solid operational performance and cost reduction initiatives, coupled with significantly lower maintenance outage expenses, and finally commercial and synergy momentum in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. As we've been saying since the recent pulp acquisition, we will continue to allocate capital to create value, and in the near term debt reduction is our priority. Putting all this together, I continue to be highly confident in our full-year view of delivering year-over-year EBITDA growth with upside to the 10% target I shared earlier this year. With that, we'll open the floor to questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Mark. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: First question, any sense \u2013 in July, first part of July how business is looking? We just heard from a competitor of yours who seems to have had a very strong start to July. Are you seeing similar trend? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Mark, I would assume \u2013 is there a particular business? I'd assume you're talking about the box market, but I don't want to ... Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Exactly, yes. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, yeah, I'll let Tim just talk about July but I think that our story is similar. Tim? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Mark. We are seeing a strong start to July for our box system. As of today, our cut-up's running 5-plus percent year-over-year and we're also seeing strong demand continue in the export markets as well. So, it feels like it's pretty robust at the moment. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And just any thoughts, any color \u2013 I mean, it just really seems to be just such a fast pace, but certainly the price increases should be in now, so you wouldn't think there's any inventory building going on. What do you think is behind what really just seems to be an exceptionally fast pace? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: You know it feels pretty broad-based to us. We're getting some help on the West Coast in terms of our agricultural position in the first quarter. Some crops that normally start coming in in March got pushed out into the second quarter and even some in the second quarter are being pushed into the third. So, we're seeing heavy ag shipments this month and we expect it again in August. But, that being said, we're seeing pickup in industrial accounts as well. So, it feels pretty broad-based. In terms of price, you were talking about it. I mean, we don't have any sense that our customers are building inventory, probably have no way to know that full stop but it's kind of hard to build inventory and hold inventory for box customers. They typically \u2013 manufacturers just don't have the space. Our price increase you referenced, it's going extremely well. We're right on top of what the expectation was and we've got a lot of flow-through coming in the third quarter. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then just one last quick one. You'd mentioned you expect to see the full or pretty much all the benefit in the second half of 2017 on that price increase. Should I take that to mean that some of it will be showing up in the fourth quarter or does it really almost all show up by the third quarter? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Almost all of it in the third quarter. We'll be 90-plus percent through the third quarter and there's a little bit of residual that flows through into fourth quarter but not a whole lot. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just with the strong volumes you're reporting in the number you just gave for July, just wondering how the system is operating on an operating rate basis? And are there any debottleneck or expansion opportunities that you might be looking a green light or might be getting a second look, given the accelerated pace of demand we're seeing? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. A great question. We're thankful that 2 years ago we embarked on adding capacity and flexibility in our system where we needed to. We're continuing to execute against that, we've only brought on about half at this point. We've got another increment that will come on in the third quarter, and then the last one will be completed next year. So, we still have the opportunities that we referenced back in 2015 that are coming online, as well as debottlenecking opportunities across our mill system. We've got a pretty broad and flexible system with a lot of capability. And so, we continue to evaluate additional opportunities there. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Brian, this is Mark. Just to add to Tim's comment the other flexibility we have in our system is International Paper serves all the major channels for kraftliner, so the U.S. domestic market, and our own box plant, the open market and the export market and our ability to move our production to where our demand signal is the strongest and our margins at the highest, gives us very flexible system including where capacity is deployed at different point in time. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And Tim, would you characterize those expansions as adding maybe 1% to your capacity every year or something a little bit lower than that? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: A little bit lower but that's in the order of magnitude. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. And just one last one from me, the consumer volume is a little bit light I take it that, that had to do with the extended maintenance outage. But, overall (18:52) seem like they've been pretty healthy for the industry and the backlogs have improved. Just wondering, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the market there. And any thoughts on the strategic importance of that asset to the company? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Brian, your take on the market is accurate. The demand has been pretty solid. Our issues of just making the product during that month with such a large asset out for such a long period of time; it's really an issue with our volume. We have seen a pick up, we convert, as you know, a percentage of our boards to make cups and fruit containers that business is doing very well. And our customers in the open market in different segments has shown some strength. We've said a number of times the Consumer Packaging business, while it's small relative to other parts of our company, it's a business and a market that we like. We think there are some synergies with other things we do. We've been working to figure out what the right role for International Paper is. When we talk about strategy and IT, we talk about building advantaged position it's an attractive market. And at any point in time, you can take a snapshot and not every part of your company meets that test. And our question that we have to answer is, is there a way to get to the advantaged position standpoint and that's what we're looking at and evaluating. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hi. I think, Glenn you mentioned earlier you're getting back to peak margins in the containerboard, in light of peak OCCs prices. But, it seems like there's a new paradigm in an issue whether it's demand, obviously limited supply and the steepening cost curve. So, bigger picture and longer term, what's the opportunity set for further margin expansion in medium term, like what do you think the next peak could be? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, I think we speak to that broadly. While referring to the second half and the second half notably has low outages so there's an annualized impact of outages that we need to apply there. But, we're going to see that margin expansion and we're going flirt with if not beat our last peak. And so we're not considering it a maximum peak by any means. The three components that are going to drive margin and EBITDA growth in the company are growth, volume and our ability to meet that volume. The reality of a steepening cost curve in a high OCC environment and the fact that we have a lot of cost savings opportunities in this big network that Tim spoke to across our system, and combine those, we see that 3% or 5% EBITDA growth over time Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: The other thing that I would add to Glenn's comments since I agree with it of course is looking at export markets. Over the last period of time as export pricing was under pressure, we lost rough order $200 million of value just through selling price decreases and that's starting to come back. So, this year, we think we'll recapture half of that. And on a run rate basis going out to the year, we should be close to whole. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess for the synergy ramp for your Weyerhaeuser has been really impressive. Is that driven by this really good execution on your front or you're just finding more opportunities and I guess longer term, could you see upside to your long term synergy target for Weyerhaeuser? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Philip, I'm going to attempt to have Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras answer that question. He's in Asia right now with Cellulose Fiber customers, but we'll give it a shot. And if it doesn't work, I'll come back and answer it. Jean-Michel? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yes. Good morning. I hope you can hear me fine. I would say the synergies are kind of have been better than we expected everywhere. We had a lot of customers in fact which were not overlapping much more than we originally thought and with our Riegelwood 18 new capacity for example, we had a much faster ramp up than we expected. Then on the supply chain, logistics, scoping it really went well. So, if you look at our numbers today, we are already at $48 million year-to-date. Our target was $60 million for the year which we clearly \u2013 we are going to beat that target. Our current run rate is about, we think end of the year $126 million. So, we feel very comfortable about the $175 million target and actually much faster than we had original planned. So, we're discovering much more opportunities than we already thought. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just one more question on that, Cellulose Fiber segment. I guess even (23:52) for that matter, pricing in softwood appears to have kind of peaked, I understand part of that's seasonality. But, there is some capacity that's coming on in the medium term, as well as the market is absorbing some of that new fluff capacity that's being qualified at this point. Just, what's your view in the next 12 months to 18 months on softwood and fluff pulp prices and that correlation dynamic? And any color on how you're thinking about rebates going forward? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Quite different I would say on softwood or fluff, I would say, there are some new capacities which are ramping up which are going to come up, which will impact for 6 months to 12 months, maybe the global operating rate in softwood. In fluff, with the growth we're having with the market demand which is kind of clearly stronger than we expected. I am less worried. I don't think we're going to be on an extremely tight market for 12 months to 18 months. But, I think that between the good growth of the market and the ramp up, which you know is always longer than many times people think in fluff. It really takes time to get qualified to ramp up. I think fluff is going to continue to be quite well balanced for this coming 12 -months to 18-months and probably after. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: And on the rebate, I'm sorry. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Oh, yeah. Operator : And your next question... Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: I believe that's your question? Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, rebate. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: I'm sorry. I think we have to be careful this year so there is a big difference between market pulp and fluff. So, I would say the trend on the last year has been an increase in the rebate, there is no doubt. But, in fluff, we really don't sell the same way we market fluff. Almost every customer has a different contract size, some are (26:10). So, it's very difficult to mix both of them. I would not do that. If I need to explain on rebate, I would be happy to. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Jean-Michel, good evening. I just want to maybe piggyback on the fluff and cellulose fiber questions. Recognizing that you might not want to get into a mark-to-market exercise, given that the synergies are coming quicker than you thought, and congratulations to you on that, when do you think you'll be in a position to maybe update whether the $175 million is the right number or maybe they could wind up being higher given the progress that you're seeing? And you enumerated a number of places where you've been getting more progress on CF synergies. Is there one or two that in particular was beneficial to you in terms of the progress so far? And then I had a couple of follow-ons. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Glenn, why don't you take the first part? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So, just on a macro basis, George \u2013 this is Glenn. I think it's preliminary right now. We're seeing, more than anything else, the rate of improvement cutting on fast. While we have expectations and it looks good relative \u2013 like I said earlier relative to the opportunities to do better; we're not in a position today \u2013 we're not in a position today to really speak to the rate which is again the underlining point of the quarter. But, we should be ready as we get closer to the end of the year. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that, Glenn. A couple of questions on paperboard broadly. I just wanted to confirm, so aside from it sounded like there was maybe $5 million of additional outage expense within Consumer. The performance in the segment was pretty much where you had expected it. Would that be fair? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. That's definitely fair. Speaking on behalf of the businesses, this is Glenn. We had strong demand. We had operational issues and had a big outage in the quarter that certainly set us back and then also put a tap on our volume, as our backlog expanded, we ultimately have delayed some of that into the next quarter. So net-net, we're comfortable with the market backdrop that was really the assignable cause of this. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And you'd mentioned some \u2013 I forgot how you said it. But, it sounded like there's some operating issues minor, but nonetheless some issues in the containerboard system in the quarter. Can you comment to what those were and if there's been any carry over? And piggybacking, I think on a question that Brian had asked earlier, the capacity expansions and really is more \u2013 mill system optimization flexibility that you're building in. If memory serves, it was about 250,000 tons and if I heard you correctly, you've gotten half of it now, you'll get half of it next year and there are incremental benefits you'd expect to get and if you could put some sort of number on that incremental that would be helpful. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hi, George, it's Tim. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Tim. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: We've gotten half of it. We've got more coming on in the third quarter of this year. And then so we'll be at about 70% implemented by the end of the year and the balance will come on next year. And then the operational issues that you referenced earlier, almost all of them were related to weather. We had Cindy, Tropical Storm Cindy that came through and knocked some of the mills down. But then we just had \u2013 towards the end of the quarter, we had some significant thunderstorm activity and weather comes through taking the utilities down which blacked a number of our mills, and then we had to scramble to get them back up. I think it's behind us. But they were pretty much all situational. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. My last question, can you comment a little bit about how Europe is going, specifically Madrid? And then before turning it over, just want to say thanks again, Jay, for all your great work in IR. We really appreciate it working with you and, Guillermo, welcome aboard. Thanks. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thanks, George. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, this is Mark. On Europe, we're right on plan for the Madrid conversion. So the equipment is all spec'd, ordered and showing up and we're ready with the team to phase out the newsprint manufacturing and convert to containerboard. We've got some exciting new technology that will go into that conversion, making it really, really high performance board. And as we showed on that slide with the small box plant acquisition in Morocco and looking at Spain and Morocco and the food basket there that uses kraftliner and high-performance recycled, it's a perfect example of building an advantage position in a really attractive market. So we're excited about the conversion and ready to get on with making containerboard and everything is right on target. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : When are you producing first commercial ton, Mark? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So the first commercial ton, we should be in December... George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: ...of this year. I hesitated, because I was thinking about when we would have kind of a reasonable ramp. It's going to be through December. Our target was always getting it converted in the fourth quarter and having it fully ramped into our system as we enter 2018. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you so much. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, George. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Hey, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered if we could kind of just jumping back to containerboard and containerboard capacity, I'm kind of reminded of that old Dr. John song about it. I don't do it, somebody else will. With the industry running at 97% right now, just it seems like the market is getting a signal that we need more capital in the business or we need more capacity in the business. Can you talk about sort of beyond that 2018 debottlenecking, what else you guys are looking at or might think about to bring on additional capacity? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hey, Mark. It's Tim. Yeah, I mean, we look at a number of things in terms of how we create value in this business. And certainly, given market conditions and the growth that we see in both boxes and in board, growing with market is a significant component of our value creation strategy. Mark's talked in the past about the breadth of capability across International Paper. We've got a great organization. We've got great assets with a lot of flexibility. So, we constantly evaluate how to deploy those assets and when to deploy them for the greatest value creation. So there's opportunities there. Not ready to speak about anything specifically, but we do have opportunities. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So just to kind of follow that a little further along though, Tim, can you say just generally right now, does it look like the better opportunity is kind of incremental debottleneck at existing mills or it might involve kind of conversions which you guys have talked about in the past. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: We've got multiple opportunities, Mark. I wouldn't want to single any one out, but I think we've got multiple opportunities. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, Tim, just one short follow- on, I just wonder if you can talk at all about what you might be doing to kind of help mitigate risk of another Kleen Products settlement? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Great question. One of the things that we do is we have a very robust pricing mechanism and pricing governance protocol within Industrial Packaging. So on a regular basis, every month, we are updating the macro factors, the metrics that we look at and evaluating how we feel about our pricing posture and that is there's a lot of analytics involved, and there's a lot of discussion and we do it religiously every month no matter what. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, Tim, also just on Brazil, can you give us some sense of what you saw in your box business in Brazil in the second quarter? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Generally, improvement across the board. Not as much as we would like, but we did get pricing improvement, our operations ran better. Volume was better, but not as good as it could have been given some of the segment issues down there around protein and then the just general market conditions. But on balance, I think we're performing better in the market, and certainly from pricing and volume, commercial excellence, the team is doing a better job down there. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, Glenn, I think you guys mentioned that $13 million insurance recovery on Pensacola in the second quarter. Can you help us understand sort of what other impacts from Pensacola we might have seen in the second quarter? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yes. Yes, I can, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just give us kind of bridging first quarter to second quarter, so we understand sort of how Pensacola kind of played into second quarter results. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Sure. So the net earnings impact was just $3 million in the quarter, Mark. The $13 million was the insurance recovery, but we had continued business interruption, this is more on the supply chain area moving through the quarter. So that was really how it affected the second quarter. If I put the whole thing in perspective, the impact we looked at for the whole year is around $63 million, $50 million of that is business interruption, the other $13 million is capital investments. We expect to recover on the earnings line $46 million of that $50 million. Insurance recovery to-date is $25 million. So the net earnings impact is miniscule, and the cash impact is at best basically the size of the deductible. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Right. That's fine. And finally, Mark Sutton, can you just update us on kind of thoughts around Ilim both in terms of IP's ownership stake there, but also I think you've got some potential expansion opportunities at Ilim, and I just wondered where those sit right now? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Sure, Mark. As we said before, we think Ilim is a powerful example of building an advantage position in a number of businesses, serving really attractive markets. So the pulp side of Ilim is really all about the Chinese and Asian softwood market. We just came off of a big capacity expansion, and we're ramping that up and getting it into the hands of the right customers in the right segments. There are more opportunities longer term in the future. We would time that when and if the market needed it in the targeted segments we have. But the opportunity is there and the advantage of fiber and logistics are just really, really compelling. The balance of Ilim is really an International Paper microcosm. We make containerboards in the Ilim business and we're working to expand that today as we speak. We also make boxes in Russia with our partners in Ilim and we make some uncoated free sheet and some other forest products. And so, those businesses are growing, serving the local market and certainly some of the markets in Eastern Europe. It's a 50/50 joint venture, right now. We really believe it's best to operate in Russia with partners. We have great partners today that are not just generic business people, they are forest industry professional that have been in the industry their whole life. And they're educated in forestry and sustainability. So the common view on how one should run a forest products company from a renewable natural resource all the way through (38:41) carbon-neutral energy generation to recoverable and recyclable products matches the IP value proposition perfectly. So ownership stakes will be discussed over time when it makes sense, but what we do like is we like the business and we like our partners and we like the potential that that business has. Under normal CapEx, inside of the normal scheme of things, we're de-bottlenecking, we're improving capacity. We're looking at things together in the industrial packaging market and that's all going very, very well and you'll continue to see a really powerful EBITDA generation out of that business. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, fair enough. Thanks and good luck in second half. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to follow up with couple of questions regarding the fluff business. So as we think about the path to \u2013 you guys have talked about longer term getting this to a $600-ish million of EBITDA business. A couple elements that will improve things, I think, 2018 versus 2017, so if you kind of help me with the size or scale or buckets of these. I mean, one is going to be your synergy stuff, which you're telling us you're ahead of and have identified new things. The second is, it was earlier you talked about some of the rebates or discounts and I guess, my question here is most of your contracts are \u2013 those only get addressed when the contracts get renewed, meaning, if there are 3, 4, 5-year, what's kind of a 10-year component to that is kind of my question. And then the second is what portion kind of just get an automatic bump when base price for fluff as we would see in the market that's up a good chunk here reflects through. So just kind of help me understand the cadence or the pace as to how this change goes? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Jean-Michel would you take a shot at answering Chris' question around contract versus non-contract and the synergy component? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Yeah. I will. Hi, Chris. I hope you can hear me fine. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Let me try to make something which is a little bit complex a bit easier. When we have price increases, those encompass being with a formula, being with an index, ultimately, we'll get about the same net price increase, it's just a question of timing. One might be immediate, another might be a three to four month maximum, I would say, before it gets applied. So the way to look at it in fluff is whatever the mechanism we have in place, ultimately you do get about the same price increase. The second question, which is more kind of the contract side, we have most of our contracts, I would say, are one to two years. So we have many of our contracts two years. And some of these contracts are not formal. Some are very formal, some are in countries where they're usually more so, hey, this year the target is, let's say, 57 tons. And I can tell you, it's works as well as a very contractual contract because we are partners for long time and we inter depend on one from the other. So it's a mix of different things, it's not just one way to do it, which is why maybe sometimes it's confusing. But at the end, it's the same result to the long-term commitments with our customer, and the pricing goes through as the market can accept it depending on our demand versus our supplies. So the normal things of market applies with different mechanism but the same result. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So ultimately, we're still \u2013 it maybe \u2013 it's still a couple year process to get towards your big picture target of $600-ish million? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yes. I mean, this is \u2013 if you take the average, I would say, cycle prices, which we had around 2015, you can see we're not that yet there. We are progressing significantly this year, but we might be on the pricing only side halfway. On the synergy side, we are ahead. So, yeah, I would say, a couple of years, which is as we said on a normalized price market is what we need to get there. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then one question for Glenn, usually this is the time a year or so when you guys take a look ahead at the pension. I know you did a big settlement last year. But how would you view or think to the appetite as you sit here today to doing another kind of pre-fund component of the pension as you have in the last couple years or do you think you're pretty well set for the next few? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, as you know, we have no mandatory contributions in the near term. But with that said, we are in a deleveraging mode and we're looking at all our options to most efficiently deleverage to bring our ratios back in line with our target. So I would say that's an option that's still on the table. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Hey. Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : I guess, Tim, can you maybe offer some perspective on what you're thinking about in terms of OCC? What's been driving it? What you expect maybe over the balance of this quarter and just fundamentally, is this a new normal? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, certainly, over the long term, we've always said we expect OCC pricing to move to higher levels. Our crystal ball is probably not any better than anyone else's in the short term. We think we're going to see some modest uptick in the quarter, in the third quarter. You read a lot and you talk to your people on the ground a lot. I think, first of all, demand which has been pretty strong is one component of it. And then generation, supply being tighter is another component. And what I think I understand is that traditional retailers' generation is not growing. It's holding, but it's not growing. And so there's an e-commerce impact. There's probably a distribution or redistribution impact as well. But I think quite frankly, up at this level and sustained, we see that in the future. This time last year, I don't think any others would have predicted it for this year. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : And I mean, any sense of how much of what's been going on, it's been domestic versus pull from China? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I think, it's both, China pulled back earlier in the year and maybe there's some timing here as they kind of race to catch up. But I think, it's broad based and you look to other markets around the world and OCC is up in those markets as well, so other countries in Asia. And so I think this is \u2013 you can find pockets where there maybe anomalies, but I think it's fairly widespread. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Gail, this is Mark. Just to add to what Tim said. If you just take it up a level and look at, this OCC phenomena is a great example of this whole business model and you can't look at it in isolation. Kraftliner and OCC go together. OCC begins its life as virgin fiber and as the market for packaging \u2013 sustainable packaging grows, where it grows determined what type of fiber is used, but the feedstock for that fiber is virgin fiber largely generated in the southeast U.S., some in Brazil, some in Northern Europe. And so the dynamic is China, let's take that as an example, China surprised everyone by really ramping up their collection rate beyond what people thought they could do. And it reached very, very world-class levels and they're there now. So any incremental growth has to be fed with strong fiber coming from other regions and then you got the dynamics that Tim described where we might recycle as individual consumers a little less diligently than a large retailer would. So generation suffers for a while. But at these prices, the market will find its place and OCC becomes really, really valuable. And I know where we live in this area of the country. OCC generation is actually increasing because the municipalities have really stepped up curbside, making it easy for consumers to do it, may not be the same in dense large cities, but that's something that we will see play out. But it all starts with this pretty good business model of renewable natural resources, making products that are using the by-products to make energy in a carbon-neutral way with biomass. And then in the case of the corrugated box in the U.S., 90% captured and recovered and recycled. So the amount of attractiveness that has with customers and segments is just not to be underestimated. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. And just one last one. A European producer has just announced an acquisition of a U.S. player and they're talking about being a multi \u2013 a supplier to multinational customers. And I'm just wondering as someone that has a toehold in the European market, the Latin American market, is that a real trend and opportunity that you see in the market or is it more in local terms? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I'll take the first part. And Mark may have something he wants to add, Gail. But this is \u2013 it's not new necessarily, we've been talking about this for a long time. Certain companies are more equipped and capable of taking advantage of it than others, customers, I mean. Where we can and it adds value for us and it adds value for the customer, we certainly do those kind of things. We do it between our footprint in Brazil, our footprint here and in Europe. So there's certainly opportunities. I personally don't see it as a broad brush type of seismic shift, if you will. And having the capability broadly to meet those customers' needs is sometimes a significant hurdle to get over as well. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning and congratulations to Jay and Guillermo on the new roles. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Thanks. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Pulp and paper we showed a $20 a ton increase in corrugated medium prices this past month, I was just wondering if you could quantify the impact, if any, that you anticipate. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, it's Tim. It'll be minimal to us. We don't sell a lot. We don't buy a lot. We break for a little bit. So it'll have a minimal impact, not all of our customer contracts reference medium. And so where they do, you can pass through, where they don't, you won't get it but it's single-digit millions on an annual basis for us. Yeah. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you referenced the very strong export pricing that we've been seeing in the slides, but I'm guessing your margins domestically are still better. Is it possible to quantify how much you pulled out of the export market in 2Q, if you anticipate pulling incremental tons out in 3Q, just kind of the mix of export versus the domestic market given the very strong demand we've seen in the U.S. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We export between, say, 12% and 15%, depending on the time of the year, but year by year, it's in that range. We didn't really pull back a lot during the second quarter. Given Pensacola and its exposure to the export markets, we were working hard to meet all of our demand here in North America and also working to catch up with customers that we have commitments to in other parts of the world. So it was a strong push across all the channels in the second quarter. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glenn, just a clarification on the bridge you gave us. If we take all those pieces, would that get us to about $1.1 billion for the third quarter on EBITDA? I didn't catch everything, so I just wanted to confirm that with you. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, I think we outlined the areas on our outlook that we have a clear line of sight on. And if you can pick that back up in the transcript, we don't come out and just give a broad-based number. But directionally, I think if you look at and do the math on the pieces that we've built up, you'll get it in that range, and you could speak to Jay and Guillermo afterwards. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Regarding the bridge as well, what exactly is your pulp price forecast for the second half? And secondarily, what is the flow-through or the anticipated flow-through in the third quarter from your previous price increases that had a, call it, two to three-month lag? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, again, we're not going to be forecasting, looking forward on pricing. We gave you the macro view of net-net in the pulp business for the third quarter, an incremental $10 million that has all the pass-through that that's going to come through from what's been announced and that's net from some of the situation relative to volume and the seasonality, as well as the dip in softwood prices. So, again, that's a round number of $10 million net-net. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just two others, one, in terms of what Jean-Michel was saying, because historically, I believe, softwood and fluff pulp have moved basically exactly in line with each other. So is he saying that he thinks that will de-couple to some extent in the future? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Jean-Michel, do you want to take that? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Jean-Michel speaking here. Yeah, I would take it. When we look at softwood and fluff, you do see some conversion long term but not immediate. There can be a broad band of difference between softwood and fluff, and they don't move at the same speed at all. So I would say a plus 30% or 50% or what is going today on softwood and what is going today on fluff is really not related. We have very different situation in fluff. Even if we have like every year a little bit of seasonality in the summer, which is a bit lower, fluff prices run lower, very stable with the end of the pricing season in fluff versus the slight decrease you have in softwood. So we need a big difference between the two before you can see one of them affecting the other. This level of swing you have in softwood today does not affect fluff at all. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for that Jean-Michel. And just, Glenn, one last one for your on cash flow. Do you expect a meaningful step-up second half versus first half in terms of cash flow? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We don't forecast cash flow either, Adam. But at the end of the day, you could see that there's a significant step-up across the board and cash flow should fall in line with that as well. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. If you could talk a little bit about a couple of markets we haven't talked a lot about in terms of the markets and that is especially the fluff market as you see the growth there. I know you mentioned Riegelwood is ramping up on the production side a little better than you expected. But what's the demand look like out there? Is it something that's still looking 3% to 4% up? Or is it varying from what the recent past has been? And then also on uncoated, if you could talk about the fact that outside the U.S. we seem to have prices going up, I believe that's true. Certainly, RISI is saying that. And is that having any impact at all in the U.S. market in terms of us not being as attractive for some of the importers? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Jean-Michel, do you want to take the first question on fluff demand globally? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Yeah. So fluff demand globally is actually very stable growth. I would say the recent trends are even... [Technical Difficulty] (56:40-56:47) Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think we might have lost \u2013 I think we might have lost him. So I'll finish this sentence. Fluff growth, we're seeing in our customer portfolio and I think the public numbers are close, but more than 4% growth. We had built our model in the 3% or so range and we're north of 4%. Some regions did 4%. Some regions even more than that and across a broad-base of uses from baby diapers all the way through the adult incontinence and hygiene products. And so part of that just have to do with, we just track GDP per capita in different parts of the world with tight correlation when people can afford these products. That's where the highest growth rates are. So we feel really good, Chip, about what we're seeing, there's innovation going on in those products that are making them more accessible to more people around the world. And we are right there in the middle of all that innovation. And that's part of what the combination of IP and warehouse of those products is a much, much stronger innovation DNA inside of our company that we had as IP alone. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.: Chip, this is Mike Amick. Your question around this particular market, if you look at the data imports into the U.S. whether on a quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year they're roughly flat. There's not been a whole of change there. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood. But are you \u2013 do you anticipate or are you feeling \u2013 because I know you sell paper around the world. Are you feeling the strength or stronger pricing outside the U.S. in uncoated? W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.: We are, we've seen some modest increases as we reported. You see in the appendix pages and also in EMEA as well. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So Mike, you've been a little bit modest you've got strong pricing pressure in Latin America. And Chip, obviously, it's the differential that makes the U.S. less attractive to Mike's point. We probably will see in the quarters probably stay in the range. It's typically how the market incremental trade flows have worked in the past and that we don't see anything that would say or they would work differently. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Got you. Thank you. Operator : And now, I would like to turn it back over to Jay Royalty for closing remarks. Jay Royalty - International Paper Co.: Well, thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. Michele, Guillermo and I will be available after the call. Our phone numbers are on slide 19 of the presentation and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 International Paper Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call for your questions. It is now my pleasure to handover program over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim JV, slide 4 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I'm going to begin today's presentation on slide 5. International Paper delivered strong results in the third quarter, with earnings growth across all of our business segments. These results were driven by continued solid business fundamentals and price realization, particularly within our North American Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. Our Global Cellulose Fibers business also generated $52 million in synergies, which contributed to solid margins for the business in the quarter. Our Papers business delivered solid results as well, underscoring the resiliency of our overall portfolio. Unfortunately, our operations were impacted by two hurricanes during the quarter. And even as our teams managed the recovery extremely well and safely, often through very challenging personal circumstances, it was nevertheless a significant headwind in the quarter. We also faced record high OCC prices in the third quarter, with average prices $14 per ton higher than in the second quarter. Our Ilim JV delivered solid operational results, driven by strong underlying demand and price realization. And yesterday, we announced a strategic decision to transfer our North American Consumer Packaging business to Graphic Packaging. I'd like to take a few minutes to share some thoughts regarding this announcement. So turning to slide 6, I'd like just to start by revisiting how we think about strategy and value creation and how that framework shaped our decision to transfer our business, our North American Consumer Packaging business and to essentially invest in a stronger Graphic Packaging. Quite simply, our strategy is to create value in fiber-based packaging, pulp and paper by establishing what we call advantaged positions and serving attractive markets. What this means is that, when we choose the right products and the right markets and the right customers in those markets and importantly when we execute successfully, we create the most value for our shareholders. So turning to slide 7, when you look at our North America Consumer Packaging business, we have a talented team of people, very good assets and really great customers. However, we also realized that our business does lack the overall scale and broad portfolio offerings and the integration levels between board and converting required to grow value in this segment today. At the same time, we recognize the strong potential of the consumer packaging space overall, and wanted to find the best way to participate and create the most value for our shareholders. And so after evaluating a range of strategic options, we concluded that putting the business together with Graphic Packaging could unlock the full potential of our business today. And at a high-level, we're transferring the business and establishing an ownership interest in Graphic Packaging through a very tax-efficient structure that captures the greatest value for our shareholders. IP is investing in a strong consumer packaging platform, that is well-positioned for long-term value creation. We are creating option value in the consumer packaging space, while we remain focused on growing and improving our core businesses. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glenn, who will walk you through the details of the transaction and the rest of our third quarter performance discussion. So, Glenn? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm speaking now to slide 8 in the presentation, which outlines the key points of this transaction that combines our North American Consumer Packaging business with Graphic Packaging. First and foremost, we consider the $1.8 billion consideration for our existing Consumer Packaging business to be an excellent value for International Paper shareholders, given the implied multiple of 8.6 times our adjusted 2017 estimated EBITDA for the business. We believe strongly the transaction captures the underlying value of North America Consumer Packaging, our business today while also allowing International Paper to participate in the value-creating potential of the combined entity going forward. Regarding the specifics, IP is contributing our North American Consumer Packaging business into a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging that will hold the assets of the combined businesses for $1.8 billion. In the form of an ownership position in new entity of 20.5%, which was valued at approximately $1.14 billion at the time of the agreement and has appreciated by approximately $70 million by the close of trading yesterday. We will also receive $660 million in cash proceeds from a new loan that will be assumed by Graphic Packaging. The agreement incorporates a two-year lock-up whereby IP cannot sell its ownership interest in the partnership and a five-year standstill whereby IP cannot increase its ownership interests. From a financial pro forma standpoint, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral to slightly accretive for IP in 2018 and it's also important to note that no current cash taxes are due at the time of the transaction given the efficient tax structure we've put together. Further, we intend to use the $660 million cash proceeds to pay down existing debt, ultimately keeping the transaction leverage neutral. Going forward, we expect to receive dividends of approximately $25 million per year beginning in 2018 based on Graphic Packaging's current dividend policy. So let me sum up this discussion by saying that we feel very good about this agreement, which should close in early 2018 pending customary regulatory approvals and conditions. And International Paper is investing in a new stronger and premier consumer packaging platform that's well positioned for shareholder value creation, while further enabling our company to be focused on growing meaningful value in our core businesses of Industrial Packaging and Cellulose Fibers. So now back to the quarter. Turning to page 9 to review our third quarter financial results, the company delivered solid margin expansion and free cash flow during the quarter driven by healthy demand across our businesses, price realization and lower seasonal maintenance outages. In terms of the quarter-over-quarter bridge depicted on slide 10, we saw a significant price lift in the quarter, mainly driven by our North American Industrial Packaging business as well as continued pricing momentum in Global Cellulose Fibers. Volume was down sequentially with one less shipping day in our North American box business and seasonally slower demand in Europe. Our North American mill operations were impacted by the two hurricanes, resulting in the $30 million higher costs in the quarter, which we do not expect any insurance recovery on. Maintenance outage expenses were lower and input costs were sequentially higher, driven mostly by record high OCC prices, which peaked in the quarter. Corporate and interest expenses were also higher and the effective tax rate was more favorable, due \u2013 mainly due to investment tax credits on energy projects. And lastly, earnings from our Ilim JV were strong on improved pricing and favorable FX. Now turning to the businesses, beginning on slide 11, earnings in Industrial Packaging improved sequentially on continued price realization and lower maintenance outages. Pricing in our North American box business flowed through as expected and the 2017 spring increase is effectively complete. We also continue to benefit from higher pricing and flow through in export containerboard markets. Volume, again, was lower given one less shipping day in North America Packaging versus the second quarter as well as seasonally softer volume conditions in our EMEA Packaging business. As we said, our operations were impacted by two hurricanes with a net impact just to Industrial Packaging of $20 million during the quarter. Beyond the hurricanes, our mills were also affected by certain isolated reliability issues, which combined, put additional cost pressure on a system which continues to run full to meet our strong demand. Input costs in the third quarter were also higher driven by record high OCC prices and marginally higher wood, chemical and distribution costs associated with the impact of the hurricanes. And lastly, the business received $5 million in insurance proceeds related to Pensacola during the third quarter. On slide 12, we've outlined some of the details of our recent announcement to convert our number 15 paper machine at the Riverdale Mill from uncoated freesheet to high quality virgin whitetop containerboard. This again is an excellent example of our strategy that Mark outlined : to establish and leverage advantaged positions in attractive markets and to grow value by investing in high-return projects that support growth in our strategic segments. Further given our refocusing of resources to our core businesses, this project will be funded within our existing annual capital investment allocation run rate. We are aiming for a mid 2019 startup, which is timed well given our outlook on incremental demand. Now on slide 13, our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered very solid results as well in the third quarter. Earnings improved $45 million, driven by better pricing, lower maintenance outage spending and strong synergy realization, despite having overcome a $5 million headwind from Hurricane Irma. All-in, we're very pleased with the progress in Global Cellulose Fibers, which improved to a 19% average EBITDA margin in the quarter, again exemplifying our commitment to allocate our resources to growing profitable businesses. Project to date, Global Cellulose Fibers is performing well ahead of our initial acquisition financial model expectations. Turning to slide 14, as you can see, our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered very strong synergy realization performance in the third quarter, capturing $52 million across the enterprise, including approximately $17 million of one-time benefits for tax credits related to the energy projects I spoke of earlier. All-in, we have high confidence in our ability to continue to deliver synergies at a faster rate than originally outlined. And we also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm our new synergy target of $200 million, which we view as an essential pillar to the sustained earnings potential of the business. Moving to Printing Papers, results came in better than expected, driven by improved price and mix, particularly in our Brazil business, as well as continued price realization in European Papers. Maintenance outage expenses were significantly lower in the third quarter as expected, while input costs were impacted by higher fiber and energy. On slide 16, as you can see, our Consumer Packaging business results improved sequentially across all components of the financial bridge. Commercially, pricing continued to improve on realization of the April 2017 price increase and planned mix upside was delivered. Lastly, maintenance outage expenses were significantly lower in the quarter again as expected. Moving to Ilim, the JV again delivered solid results, driven by higher pricing, which was partially offset by lower volume related to the Bratsk maintenance outage. And equity earnings also benefited from a non-cash FX gain on the JV's U.S. denominated debt. So, let me now turn to page 18. This is our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect to see flow through benefits from the spring 2017 North American containerboard and box price increase as well as further price realization in export markets, which in the fourth quarter alone should amount to an incremental $20 million. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we anticipate additional price realization and mix benefits of $15 million on continued strong global demand, particularly in China. We also want to note that Brazil Papers \u2013 in Brazil Papers, we expect an additional $10 million in earnings on better seasonal mix. On volume, our North American box business will be unfavorably impacted by one less shipping day, even as we expect demand to remain very strong. Across our other businesses, we anticipate stable volumes with some modest seasonal improvement as noted in the heat map for a total benefit of about $15 million. In operations, our North America Industrial Packaging business will improve by $35 million as we put the hurricanes and other operational issues we discussed earlier behind us. Within our Global Cellulose Fibers business, operating costs will be modestly higher and planned maintenance outage expenses across the entire enterprise are expected to increase by $11 million in the fourth quarter. Input costs, again, in North America Industrial Packaging, are expected to improve by $35 million quarter-over-quarter. This is driven by lower OCC costs, but partially offset by higher wood and chemical costs. Across our other businesses, we anticipate $15 million in higher input costs, partly driven by the lingering effects of the hurricanes primarily in wood and chemicals. Lastly, in the other items category, we included our refined outlook for corporate expenses, interest expenses, tax rates and equity earnings from our Ilim JV. So to close, on page 19 for me and before I hand the call back over to Mark, we wanted to address our capital allocation priorities. While we speak often about our balanced use of cash approach, it all starts with strong cash from operations. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our cash generation. With that said, in the near-term, we are clearly in a de-leveraging mode following our pulp acquisition last year as we aim to bring our leverage back to less than 3 times debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's adjusted basis by the end of next year. And as noted earlier, the cash contribution of the Graphic Packaging transaction was structured to ensure we have no obstacles and a clear path toward meeting our balance sheet commitments. At the same time, within the quarter, we also took material risk off the table with targeted moves inside our pension plan, including the recently announced annuity purchase that essentially transferred $1.3 billion in pension benefit obligations to a highly rated retirements benefits provider. All this enabled us to continue to increase our dividend. Earlier this month, we announced our sixth consecutive annual dividend increase since restoring it to pre-recession levels in 2011, keeping with our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend as earnings and cash flow expand. And lastly, we will continue to reinvest in value-creating projects, and with a healthy spread above the cost of capital, such as the Madrid and Riverdale conversions we have discussed in detail. So in summary, the takeaway here is that we are confident in our cash generation and reinforce our commitment to a balanced use of cash as we enter 2018. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Glenn. International Paper is well-positioned for a strong fourth quarter, and with solid results across the board and solid cash generation. We continue to see healthy global demand across our key businesses. And we expect additional margin expansion from our first half pricing initiatives. On input costs, we expect some relief from record high OCC prices in the third quarter with some offsets on seasonally higher wood as well as higher chemicals and energy. We also anticipate another quarter of strong synergy generation in our Global Cellulose Fibers business and a seasonally light maintenance schedule across our mill system. Net-net, we are optimistic for a solid performance in the fourth quarter with excellent cash generation and a very strong year for International Paper. With that, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Thanks for the details. And congratulations on the transaction announcement and the progress throughout the year. Just housekeeping, folks, I just want to double check. On the bridge sequentially that you provided, unless I'm double counting something, I kind of came up with something between $0.15 and $0.20 sequential pick up in earnings fourth quarter versus third quarter. Is that in the ballpark? Or did we miscalculate something? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: I think that's roughly in the ballpark, there is certainly a sequential uplift, George, quarter-over-quarter. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that, Glenn. Second question I had regarding Consumer. Obviously you're putting the North American Consumer business into the venture with Graphic Packaging. When we think about Kwidzyn, obviously that was part of Consumer, it produces a lot of different grades, but one of them was coated board. What's the role of Kwidzyn in the strategy for International Paper on a going-forward basis? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, it's a great question. We do have a board machine at Kwidzyn, and we also have one at our Svetogorsk mill in Russia. They serve targeted segments that are generally in the Consumer Packaging. That's not part of this transfer into Graphic Packaging. And when we think about what we do in Europe, we have \u2013 we serve a number of markets, packaging, industrial and consumer, uncoated freesheet, we make boxes. We don't do any consumer packaging converting. And really when you look at mills in countries like Poland and Russia, you tend to have the model where you use the wood advantage and you make some of the products that the market needs locally in all kind of segments. So, that's still an important part of our EMEA Paper and Packaging portfolio. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Mark, thanks for that. My last two and I will turn it over. One of the things that we were picking up at recent industry conferences and we're seeing a little bit in your results here as well, some building impact from inflation throughout the supply chain, everything from input cost to labor. Can you comment on that and to the degree to which your customers are beginning ask you, maybe mostly in the box and containerboard business how you might be able to help them either with the systems or machinery approach or some other approach that help them take cost out of the supply chain, and how are you dealing with inflation as well on your business? And then Riverdale, a little bit more costly conversion than what we've seen in the most recent round of conversion, I know whitetop's a consideration there. Is there anything else that we should consider in terms of the capital cost per ton on that conversion? Thank you. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hey, George, it's Tim. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, Tim. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: On Riverdale, I'll start with that \u2013 hey. Start with Riverdale and then I'll go back to your previous question and Glenn may have something he wants to add. But on Riverdale, we know this internally, a machine is not a machine, a mill is not a mill, and so, it depends on what you're trying to do. This is going to be a two-ply sheet. It's a bit more of a sophisticated \u2013 I mean, we understand that we've done it before, but sophisticated investment. And when you look at it on an annual ton basis, we still think it's very attractive with very attractive return. So, we're going to be making a whitetop liner, not a brown product as the lead product on the machine. So, I think it's understandable on that basis. Your inflation question, I mean just from a box standpoint and Industrial Packaging standpoint, we work with our customers all the time on trying to help them take cost out of their system. And we do it through a number of means. We have technical experts inside. We're either looking at case erecting equipment or we're looking at process flow. So it's pretty much ongoing. And we don't often talk about it, but just in general inflation internally to the business, we have a significant lift every year that we have to try to cover and then have initiatives that create value on top of that. So I'm not familiar with the conference you're referencing or the comments, but that's just a little color on what we do. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Tim, the internal inflation, I'll let you go here, what is that roughly, can you remind us? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: It varies from year-to-year, but it's significant. I mean, it's over $100 million. So \u2013 and then in recent years, medical cost have jumped up a little bit, so it's not uncommon for us to have $120 million to $130 million of just general inflation built into the business that we have to cover. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, sir. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, this is Mark. Just a final comment on inflation. One of the things we target in our internal improvement, something we call non-price initiatives, so reliability improvements in our manufacturing operations and cost improvements in all our business processes, we target to overcome that internal inflation at a minimum and maybe in some cases do better than the internal inflation. And then we work on input cost and all of that with our commercial terms. So it's part of our philosophy of how we need to operate every year. One last comment on Riverdale, capital costs are also relative to what system you're investing it in. And the way we look at this is, this will be the 17th containerboard mill in our world class systems. So the investment in Riverdale also enables savings in other parts of the system that don't show up in just a capital cost per annual ton. We are currently buying bleached fiber to make whitetop in a mill that was designed to make brown linerboard, that mill will now be free to make brown linerboard. So there's system effects, when you have a system our size, that the capital cost per ton can be a little deceiving. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Mark, thanks for that. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Steve. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: First of all \u2013 good morning. I had a question on pulp actually. It looks like the pulp price realizations were up $33 a ton year-over-year, with presumably a richer mix, but list prices were up easily $100. So, evidently the discounts are growing. And I guess, question one is, is there a pent-up pricing that we're going to see in the future that we're going to start to catch up with realizations? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Hi, Steve. Jean-Michel speaking. Good morning. I think there is a couple of things to look at. First of all, there's a big mix effect, too, in the price of pulp because you get a price, which includes fluff, which includes softwood in general, so sometimes it doesn't appear really like it is, because if you just take fluff, our realization is more like $65. So, it's kind of high of what you have here. The other thing is, we have \u2013 when we take what happen usually in the market, but then what happened this year is after the contract negotiation in 2016 and that's a (24:48) question of rebate or whatever, in general, the prices went down in Q1. So, when we compare to last year, you have to be careful because you have the drop of $20 in Q1 that we have tendency to forget. So, if you take December to today or quarter-to-quarter, you have the increase was down, plus the drop, which will make up for. So, the actual price increase realization is more around $65. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: So, thanks, Jean-Michel. Does it make sense to reduce the discounts, so that the realizations are closer to what the lists are? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: So, to be honest with you, this is a \u2013 it's a complicated and complex question. Some customers wants to work with an index. And the reason is relatively logical, which is because we do multi-year contracts. And they feel that it's better with an index. But I'm not always sure that an index and a discount is the right way to make price. Even if when you look at the long-term, ultimately it comes to the same number. But we don't sell on the index. Let's not forget that we have a lot of customers, which are list price quarter-to-quarter or monthly price, so the mix of contracts, list price, is always another difficulty to do, but I understand your point. This being said, as of today, we haven't found a better way to look on very long-term contract pricing, that doesn't mean we're not trying to find one. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick one on the Graphic Packaging deal, so I guess we're going to create a second equity earnings line similar to Ilim and you'll get a $25 million annual dividend, is that the way to model it? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: There'll be an equity earnings line and we will also get, from a cash basis, a $25 million dividend. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. And if you were to monetize it and I \u2013 looks like a great investment, in the couple of years, would you get 64 million shares in GPK plus the 4% cash component? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: So, essentially it would be broken down, so 19% of that would be in shares and the remaining would be in cash. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Oh I was thinking it was 16% or 17% (27:14). Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with The Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. One, obviously waste paper OCC's been very, very volatile, wanted to get your take as to what you're seeing currently and what would you expect to happen in the months ahead? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I'm sorry, Mark, that was for OCC? Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Mark, Tim. I don't know that my crystal ball or our crystal ball is any better than anyone else's. I think that we believe that there may be some elements in the China market that are starting to buy again. I think there was a period of review given permit levels and making sure that no one exceeded a permit level in China for this year, caused a bit of review and maybe a cessation of some part of purchases. And now, it may be that some of that is starting to come back as we approach the end of the year. But I think the full effect of what's happened in China is still rippling through the North American market. So, in big picture terms, I think OCC goes higher, it's hard to put an exact time on it until we see exactly what China does around not only re-issuing permits, but at what levels. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And do you have any intelligence on where that dialog on contamination levels in particular might be? And if, in fact, that were to be at the 0.3%, what type of capability do you have in your system to, for instance, bring OCC to meet those levels? And how might the market play out if, in fact, these very aggressive limits on contamination levels were to be put in place? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: That's a great question. I think it's a bit of wait and see. I don't know that we would say we have any differential capability that anyone else does not have, it's a challenge, it's at very low level. I think it's going to impact some grades of waste fiber more than others obviously. But yeah, it's very low and I don't know how that ultimately gets worked out. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So Mark, let me add just a little bit. This will settle out given the importance of this input material for the Global Packaging business. So for example, if capital is needed to better screen OCC at different quality levels and the economics are there because by not doing it you've eliminated part of the supply, the capital will be spent. There are other ways to manage fiber quality, the fiber quality gradient by treatments on recycled paper machine. So my view is, this is a really important long-term input material for the Global Packaging business. And as the market grows, the fiber quality will be stretched. And over time, you will find capital solutions or other types of workarounds to manage a different quality of fiber, just like you manage in some cases different qualities of virgin wood fiber. And so, there is an engineering solution to most of this that the economics will drive. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Makes sense. And two real quick ones. Can you tell us where your box prices were exiting the quarter versus where they were on average versus the quarter? And then maybe just what current demand trends through the first two weeks of October in containerboard and corrugated were? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Demand has been good. We're having a very solid October so far. And you know it's a tough comp given what happened seasonally last year. Yeah, we exited the quarter higher on pricing. We were probably $8 to $10 above what the average there is in the appendix. And we think we're getting full realization on both of the \u2013 both the $40 from last fall and the $50 from the spring. If you recall, there's a little bit of \u2013 it's customer-by-customer, but some customers were not impacted by the published down early last year. And so, instead of getting a $40 or $50 they got, you know, $25 to $35 depending on the movement. The other thing is, it did not apply to all tons. If you're looking at the number and thinking that it's below the $90, there's still a little bit more realization to go and some of the segments like agriculture, pricing was already set as price increase announcements came through and so that will catch up over time. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Last month, obviously, some of your competitors floated a price increase in containerboard. And I know you guys make your own determinations on price, obviously you chose not to participate in that, but just wondered, if you could comment on what the decision making process was like there? And your thoughts on the ability to pass through some of the inflation that you're seeing in some parts of the business now? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, we don't talk about forecasting price going forward. I can share a little bit about the type of internal dynamics in general that we look at when we consider pricing. There's a number of macro factors that go into that consideration, but it's not just a numbers exercise. So we try to think both tactically and strategically about pricing and how we want to manage through cycles. So we were looking at a number of factors, OCC cost being one of them, and trying to take into account \u2013 at the end of the day what we're trying to do is we're trying to grow margins sustainably. And so all of the decisions that we take, whether it's commercially or operationally is about creating value and doing it on a sustainable basis. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And a question on Riverdale, I was wondering if you could comment on what made that the right asset to convert? And once the conversion is done, where do you think that it'll \u2013 where you think its cost position will lie against your other containerboard assets and versus the North American industry in general? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. A good question. Well, we like Riverdale, it's a good mill, it's in a good fiber basket, and it's got good access to all the geographies that are important to us. So we like the mill a lot. It's got a great team there. And so we're excited to have those team members become a part of Industrial Packaging. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just a sense of where you think like maybe quartile wise... Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Oh yeah. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...it will fit on the cost curve, yeah. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, yeah, comparing it to brown and white really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. From a white standpoint, we think it'll be first quartile. So we'll get a cost advantage. It's going to be a very high quality sheet. So just everything about it looked good, and as Mark said, it does free up other machines that were producing whitetop for us, they now produce brown, and so we get a benefit there as well. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. One last one. Any initial (35:32) thoughts on 2018 maintenance expense or capital \u2013 CapEx numbers? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yes. This is Glenn speaking. Again, we'll lay out the full view of 2018 either later in the quarter or after the end of the year. But as we look at our outage schedule into next year, we have a heavy outage schedule coming at us as we move, continually move forward into our 18-month outage program. So net-net, we can expect higher outages next year, but we did not quantify that for today. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Hi, good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : In terms of the Graphic Packaging deal, is there any significant kind of corporate over \u2013 like overhead that might kind of be stranded with the company? Like, would we expect a fairly higher corporate line next year just as you work through that? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah, I think you're right on target, Gail. Certainly there will be some stranded overhead that we're going to put our energy around mitigating to the largest extent. We will plan to keep that at the corporate line next year as we work it down. We haven't quantified that exactly yet, but that's an expectation that was factored into all the analysis. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. But you'll quantify it, I guess, as they start modeling next year. And just some of the outages and issues that you've had in containerboard between Pensacola and Orange this year. Tim, can you just give any sense of where you are with your inventories? And where you might think you'll be kind of as we enter next year? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We've been tight all year, Gail. In fact it's starting with Hurricane Matthew last fall and working through that and then Pensacola as you managed, and now two hurricanes that impacted two different containerboard mills. So it's tight, we're managing it, we're getting better at how we manage it. I think we're on steady footing at the moment. And I expect us \u2013 when you run tight, you build capability. And so I think we've demonstrated to ourselves that we can run with lower levels than we've carried in the past. One wrinkle in all of that is what's happening with the transportation markets, which have been somewhat disrupted due to the same influences but also a lot tighter, given what some of the rail lines are doing around business model, but also trucking. So when supply chain delivery times start stretching out, then we need to start working with more inventory to support our network. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And maybe just one last one. I don't think you quantified but can you give any sense of what your box shipments have been doing year-on-year through what you've seen in October to date? And I appreciate it's a tough comp, but... Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Tough comp, but we are running on an absolute basis up about 4% so far through the month. So it feels very strong to us right now. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning, Mark and Glenn. First question has to do with the Riverdale conversion. If you could give us the timing of when that starts to switch over from white paper, is it going to be one \u2013 like three months or two-month period, where you're doing all the work? Or are you going to stage it like one of the other conversions we know about? And then secondly, that's a lot of whitetop at once. Are you planning to tweak your system, where maybe you'll focus more on your whitetop production at Riverdale and de-emphasize it elsewhere? Or how should we think about that? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hey Chip, it's Tim. Yeah. That's exactly the play, move it from where it's being produced today, get a better cost structure, get a very high quality sheet, and then free up those assets that are currently running it today to run other products. So that's exactly the play. On the conversion, we said mid-2019, the long lead time on all of that is finishing the detailed engineering, getting the equipment on order, getting the equipment delivered, getting everything ready to go from a project standpoint, the actual conversion really doesn't take that long, 30 to 45 days and it can come off of uncoated freesheet and be back up on containerboard. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, one other quick one. When you look at the pulp situation, I know there was a question earlier, but \u2013 and you mentioned the discount, I would imagine that varies when you re-strike contracts? And if you could just remind us, I understand that about maybe a third or so, maybe 40% are actually renewed or are subject to renewal each year and that's when that discount is addressed and I would imagine there are some movement there based on where the market is overall at that time. Is that a fair way to look at it? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Hi, Jean-Michel speaking again. Yes, you're correct, we are in the middle of \u2013 almost the end actually, the contract renegotiation. Some are more than one year, so every year roughly we do have 30% to 40% of our contracts, which are being renewed. It's really customer per customer, because it will depend of the volume they want, the product they want, the mix, so it's difficult to give a trend. I will say so far our renewal, which is the most important, because it shows the confidence from our customers is going very well. So I think that's the first thing, that means the customers are satisfied with new GCF. And this is what we wanted to achieve first and foremost. And then customer per customer really it varies tremendously. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. Welcome back. Operator : Mark, if your line is closed, can you please unmute it at this time? Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Can you hear me? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: We can now. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: We can hear you now, Mark. Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. So in your white paper outlook, you call the outlook stable in most places, I'm curious what your expectation is for white paper imports. And I was also hoping you could give us a sense of what the demand looks like from the Brazilian white paper perspective. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Mark, I'm going to ask Mike Amick, who runs our \u2013 most of our Paper \u2013 white paper business globally to take a shot at that. Mike? W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark. And hello, Mark, welcome back. Yeah, on demand from an import standpoint, as you know, North America has been down about roughly 20%. We saw that continue in the third quarter. And with respect to outlook, I don't know that it will change a whole lot. We also with respect to Brazilian demand, and in particular across Latin America, we posted two positive quarters in Brazil domestically, let's say it was (43:18) about a 0.5%. So it continues to be a little on the light side, and I wouldn't call it robust. We do \u2013 are moving into a seasonally stronger period, and we... Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Right. W. Michael Amick Jr. - International Paper Co.: ...expect to see that pick up. And demand right now both across the Americas looks pretty good as we kind of closed out third week in October. Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's super helpful. And just \u2013 I'm sorry to come back to Riverdale again, but as you move that whitetop to Riverdale and re-optimize at the other mills, is that going to actually free up productive capacity as well? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yes. So it's absolutely right, Mark. We currently produce whitetop at two other mills in our system, and we would move all of that to Riverdale, and then have the benefit of producing other products at those two mills. Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: And as you produce those products, is that going to reduce your changeovers et cetera, and will that actually increase the capacity of those assets? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: It'll increase a little bit incrementally, it's just \u2013 they'll be producing products that are easier to produce, and so we should be able to squeeze a little bit more volume out of those two mills. Mark william Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: That's super. Thank you very much. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Chris. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. One, if I could come back to the cellulosic business, Jean-Michel or Mark which ever you want to take this, just so I make sure I understand this right. When we look on a year-over-year basis, there is somewhere between $130 per ton to $160 per ton higher for various grades, with SBSK fluff et cetera. And you guys produce about 4 million tons there just a tick under, when we think about \u2013 and appreciating that some of that maybe 20 (45:17) is already down or some movement in there, I mean there could be directionally $100 million of price lift year-over-year, that could be a $400 million swing. Help me understand how that might phase in or help us scale and size what the opportunity may be appreciating that maybe not everything happens in one year and you talked about indices and different components, but I mean it sounds like a pretty big swing, and help us understand how this phasing could occur? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So, let me come back. We produced roughly 3.5 million metric tons, (45:55) most, we have on that about 65% fluff and specialty and 35% market pulp. So, they, as you know, move differently. The market pulp moves faster even if in the NBSK from Grande Prairie, we work a lot with contracts too because NBSK from Grande Prairie is very, very well appreciated. When you look at the upbeat on (46:23) prices compared to when we started the year, it's big, it's already in our number now, but you can see it, it does create an amount, which is maybe not far from the number you mentioned. And it's in our number now. I don't think there's \u2013 maybe a little bit more if Q4 continue to be strong like that. So, yes, it is a strong dynamic. I mean, if you take a 3.5 million metric tons and you get just $20 increase, that's $70 million dollars, so any increase in pulp is very strong for us. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Are there not kind of contracts for example on the two-thirds that you make that's in the fluff side that those are generally locked for a year and then they get reset the following year or I guess for a bonus (47:15), I don't feel like that's all been realized when we look at spot versus contract in the numbers. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, is there another substantial step-up, perhaps, in 2018? That's what I'm really trying to get at. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: No, you won't have on 2018 from what we've announced in 2017. 2017, what we announced will be done by the end of the year. When we have a contract that moves, they \u2013 even if they are for one year, they are \u2013 most of them, most of them again is generality, a quarterly revision with index. So, the time you get it, it's sometimes six months that you get it. And so far, most of our increase have been on the first half of the year. So, we're getting it this quarter, and so we got another 15 and we're planning to get on average another 10 or something like that, all grade included for next quarter. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: But you have the average annual yield curve. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: The average annual curve will be there, yes, because we've been very strong on the second half, if you compare to first half. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I'll follow up a bit later. One other question, I kind of wanted to touch on was, when I look at your corrugated business, it looks like you were \u2013 perhaps, Tim, you can help me with this. You were down a couple points in the quarter. I think the market was up a couple points. Was there something in particular about your mix, in particular customer mix or would we kind of expect that to go back towards market levels as you work through the next couple quarters? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah we're actually \u2013 yeah. I mean, like any point in time in a business like converting, there's things moving in and things moving out. So, we had taken some decisions that hit us earlier. We also have some new business that's coming in, that hasn't been fully ramped up yet. So, I attribute it to just timing. And you'll see our growth numbers go up as we go through the next couple of quarters with those wins coming in. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Was there anything potentially hurricane-related, that you had a bigger footprint through a region or something of that nature but... Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: A little bit, but it was \u2013 it hit us for about 7,000 tons. So, big enough but not significant in a way. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Good morning, Glenn. Thanks, everyone. Mark or Jean-Michel, just a couple on pulp, if you don't mind. In terms of the Chinese mills using more pulp in lieu of OCC at the moment, how sustainable do you think that is? And why? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: That's a very good question because I think, it's sustainable in the condition of \u2013 because they don't have the choice right now. I'm sure if they had more OCC or recycling product they could use, they would probably mix it up. So it's more a question of, is the OCC or is the recycled products going to be more available in China than anything. In terms of is it possible, it is. Actually, you see in China that all grade prices are going up, so it's not only pulp or OCC, it's all the grades because pulp and other raw materials are more expensive, it has gone through and prices are up. Is it sustainable? I can't tell you that, I don't know. Really no idea. I mean if we stay like we are today in terms of what's going on with the imports or what's going on with the government limiting the recycle, it could stay for some time. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Related question Jean-Michel, I mean, some producers \u2013 pulp producers have talked about these global pulp market conditions being the best they've been in a decade, just given all the supply disruptions and the additional Chinese demand, because of the recycled fiber import restrictions. How sustainable do you consider these conditions just based on all these unusual supply disruptions, the China situation et cetera? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: So I'm going to separate if you allow me, market pulp and fluff pulp. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: Because in fluff pulp, we don't see that impact. Fluff pulp is linked to the \u2013 and consumer consumption, and they use fluff, they cannot swing from something to another. So, the fluff pulp market worldwide continues to be very wealthy with a 4% to 5% growth. And we are growing about 4% to 5% as the market. So, I think this is one thing you have to separate from the market pulp. The market pulp is today probably, I would say, more shake up than it should be, because there is a lot of things as you were mentioning both from the demand standpoint and from the supply standpoint, which are all going out in tightening it up. How long it's going to last? I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know, but I do think with time that pressure should not be as big as it is right now. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And one last question about fluff versus market a bit, over time fluff and softwood have moved roughly in tandem with each other. Do you have reason to think that will not continue to be the case and if so why? Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: So, I think it is always a question of supply/demand as you know. And they will lack (53:04) some trends, but fluff is always much less cyclical. So, when the market pulp goes very, very high, very, very fast, we go, but because \u2013 not so fast. And when the market goes down, we don't go down as fast either. So, it's a less cyclic market. Then, of course, you have some products with sawmill which can go from fluff to SBSK (53:34) for example, so that can impact one market or the other. So this is more why I think you've seen some trend following each other. I kind of think that with time it could be that that link separates a little bit more. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Jean-Michel. I appreciate it. Jean-Michel Ribi\u00e9ras - International Paper Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hi, Debbie. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. I wanted to go back to Industrial Packaging. I think you addressed some of the questions on price mix and the hurricane impact. Could you talk about Europe and Brazil specifically? I think Europe was a bit lower than I was expecting? And then just kind of the outlook for both of those regions going forward? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I can start with Brazil. Yeah, we had a slightly better quarter, which was good to see in Brazil, volume was a little bit better. We've actually been performing quite well on a volume standpoint. Our operations ran very well during the quarter in Brazil as well. We're nowhere near where we want to be, but it seems like the economy was starting to pick up a little bit more and volume was beginning to recover. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: On the volume recovery, do you have any sense of what specifically is improving and driving that? Because there's been a lot of comments about the backdrop in Brazil improving and I don't think a lot of answers as to what specifically is driving that. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: It took a little bit of a hit early in the quarter on protein, given all of the disruption from the news that you \u2013 I'm sure you've seen, related to some of the political scandals. But that didn't turn out to be as bad as we thought it might and actually recovered through the quarter. But it's fairly broad based. It just seems like economic activity is picking up broadly in Brazil over the past quarter. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: And, Debbie, in relation to the EMEA question, you're correct, couple factors. One is the seasonality in the third quarter that we spoke to, relative to box demand. The other factor is we are in the full conversion of the Madrid mill and we didn't have any \u2013 or didn't have material newsprint sales or production in the quarter, which put some stress on fixed cost absorption. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So when we look to 2018 then I'm assuming that European contribution becomes positive... Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yes. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...in that segment. Okay. And then just final question. You talked a bit about the $210 million in EBITDA for NA consumer, but \u2013 and you're going to quantify the corporate later, but were there any other one-time items that you could call out? I think there was something maybe related to maintenance. To help us just understand the deviations that we're already noticing? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Inside the $210 million adjusted EBITDA, that we're using... Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: ...it was largely Augusta, Debbie. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And can you quantify that? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, in the quarter it was $15 million to $20 million (56:56). Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one final question this morning. Our final question will come from Dr. Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Glenn. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You know, Mark, you've got two businesses now that are going to be reported below the EBITDA line. And I just am curious as to whether this is making you think any more about potentially kind of raising your stake in consolidating Ilim going forward? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Mark, the Ilim joint venture is, as you know, a very, very well advantaged business. And we continue to be happy with that investment and with our partners. And we will continue to grow that business together. The ownership structure, if we change it ever, will be done cooperatively and collaboratively with our partners. But having it below the line isn't the driver. Making sure it's the right thing to do from a value creation. But I understand what you're saying around getting full recognition for that powerful EBITDA generation. And that's strategically as we kind of think about what advantaged positions mean, that's one of the criteria we look at is what's the best way to structure it and make sure that it's properly recognized and that our investors can see it for what it is. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Just another one. Glenn, can you just help us with the transaction yesterday? If you guys monetize that position two plus years down the road... Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Right. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...what's the tax implication of that? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Okay. So essentially if we sold the business outright, we would basically have a $1.2 billion (58:47) tax basis on the $1.8 billion and we'd pay 38% of that. On any appreciation above and beyond that, down \u2013 two years down the road, we do have a tax receivable agreement in place, so that would allow us to get an offset since there would be a \u2013 that we would have a gain, but the JV would also have a tax basis step up in the amount equal to that gain realized by us. So basically Graphic [Packaging] would pay us the NPV of 50% of that gain back. So, there is an offset on the accretion of the deal on taxes that we would pay if we exited our original tax exposure, less the basis. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then just a couple things on containerboard. Can you tell us, Tim, did you get any benefit from that summer corrugating medium hike? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No, it's fairly neutral to us. We do purchase a little bit of medium through trades and so it has a modest negative impact, but it's not substantial by any means. And most of our contracts on the box side are in terms of price pass through and what not are linerboard based, there's a few that have a medium component but not many. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then can you \u2013 with regards to Riverdale, can you just help us think about sort of the potential conversion of that second machine down there, at some point how you're thinking about that? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I think that it gives us tremendous optionality. So we look out in time and there's still good demand on the uncoated freesheet side of the business for number 16 and \u2013 but we have the option at a point in time further down the road of thinking about other uses for it. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Are there any inefficiencies in trying to run it as a split mill right now or going forward? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No. I mean, we do that in a number of places across the system where we have a landlord and tenant making multiple products, we know how to do that. So, I don't \u2013 it actually works quite well in terms of covering all the fixed costs that are in there in everything. We did look at a point in time, what a conversion would look like, and so, we know that and it's just a matter of understanding what the business need is to support our customer growth at a point in time. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Mark, one thing interesting about Riverdale, it's a little unique for most of our mills, is it was built by Hammermill and it was built as two distinct process lines. So many years later, it makes the conversion to one product on one line co-existing with another product on another line, actually a pretty good fit versus mills that were built to be multi-line mills with a common pulp mill and a common backend. So it's really working in our favor now. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. That actually gets to the question I was kind of \u2013 I was really curious about. Finally, any thoughts about potentially converting white paper over to containerboard down in Brazil? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: That's not on our radar screen right now, given the two things, one is, it's probably the best place in the world to make high quality uncoated freesheet and it's \u2013 we competitively export it around the world. And two, you've got to look at the forest, and most of the Brazilian softwood is spoken for, would take a long time to plant and grow, and you got mostly eucalyptus forest. So the fiber basket is really conditioned for hardwood based grade, so at least in the near future. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Fair enough. Good luck in the fourth quarter, guys. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thanks. Operator : That will conclude our Q&A session for today's call. It is now my pleasure to hand our program back over to Guillermo for any additional or closing remarks. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thank you. And thank you, everyone for taking time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call for \u2013 after this call. Our phone numbers are on slide 21 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the third quarter 2017 International Paper earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning. And thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide two of our presentation. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim joint venture, slide four provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. With that, I now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and 2017 full year earnings call. I'm going to start on slide five. International Paper delivered a strong year of performance in 2017. When we entered 2017, we said it would be a year of two halves. And we made a commitment to a strong second half performance in order to deliver more than 10% EBITDA growth for the year. I'm very pleased to share with you today that we delivered 16% EBITDA growth in 2017, excluding the Consumer Packaging business, which we are recording as discontinued operation. The 16% EBITDA growth includes 10% of organic earnings growth and 6% from earnings growth related to the pulp acquisition. Including Consumer Packaging, we delivered $3.9 billion in EBITDA in 2017 or a 13% year-over-year growth. Our performance was driven by excellent commercial execution across our businesses and solid synergy realization in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. We continue to grow value for our shareholders with an ROIC of 10%, solidly exceeding our cost of capital. We also made substantial progress on many fronts, including the outstanding integration of our Global Cellulose Fibers business, as well as accelerating strategic investments for growth in Industrial Packaging. We also made an important strategic move in Consumer Packaging that further enables us to focus on growing value in our core businesses. We generated strong free cash flow of $2 billion in 2017, which enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our dividend for the sixth consecutive year. I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the continued strong performance at our Ilim JV, which delivered solid operational and financial results and provided more than $130 million in cash dividends in International Paper in 2017. So overall, I feel very good about what we accomplished in 2017. And as importantly, I'm really excited about how we are positioned as we enter 2018. Turning to our full-year results on slide six, and I'll remind you again that Consumer Packaging is now reflected in our financials as discontinued operations from 2013 onwards. Do keep in mind that our free cash flow does include discontinued operations. For 2017, we grew revenue by 11%, driven by the pulp acquisition and excellent commercial performance across our businesses, with improvements in volume, pricing, and mix. And those improvements accelerated throughout the year. This enabled us to offset significantly higher average for recovered fiber cost and other input cost headwinds such as transportation to grow our margins and deliver solid earnings and free cash flow in 2017. Moving to slide seven. International Paper continues to be a strong and sustainable cash generator, which enables us to execute our strategy and optimize capital allocation to continue growing value for our shareholders. On slide eight, International Paper delivered another strong year of return on invested capital, with a 300 basis point spread to our weighted average cost of capital. This marks our eighth consecutive year of value-creating returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Glenn, who will cover the performance across our businesses and a few other financial topics, including our first quarter outlook. Glenn? Glenn Landau : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide nine in the presentation, which shows our full-year operating earnings per share bridge from 2016 to 2017. Notably, as you can see, price and mix improvements played an important role in our earnings growth in 2017 and was largely driven by realization-associated increases announced in our North American Industrial Packaging and Global Fibers businesses earlier in the year. Operations, on the other hand, were negatively impacted by two significant hurricane events and the interruption of production at Pensacola. Our maintenance outages in legacy operations were a partial offset. Our reported higher outages in our acquired pulp business are captured in the pulp acquisition column. Input costs were clear and sustained headwind through most of 2017, driven by significantly higher recovered fiber cost, OCC on year-over-year basis, along with higher energy and transportation costs, especially during the latter part of the year. Moving across the bridge, I'll point out the negative swing at Ilim. It was due primarily to FX. And lastly, we have the baseline carryover benefit of the pulp acquisition whose positive contribution accelerated as the year progressed. Now, let's turn to slide 10 and focus on our results for the fourth quarter that show a strong finish to a solid year. International Paper delivered record operating EPS in the fourth quarter of $1.27 and continued to see healthy demand in US and globally. Our North American Industrial Packaging business and Global Cellulose Fibers business both had record volumes in the quarter. And we benefited from the full realization of first half price increases and continued price gains in export markets across our portfolio. Global Cellulose again outpaced our plan, delivering more synergies and faster. And our Ilim JV delivered strong performance, with $64 million in equity earnings underlying the strength of that platform. All-in, we had another very solid quarter capped with stronger free cash flow and generation. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter EPS bridge on slide 11. We saw more price realization in the fourth quarter, now driven by further gains in containerboard exports and higher prices across all pulp grades. Volume was strong as well, with record shipments in North America box, containerboard exports, and our pulp grades in the quarter. Unlike the year-over-year trend, inputs provided some relief in the fourth quarter as OCC moved off its historical highs established in third quarter. This was partially offset though by seasonally higher wood costs, higher chemical costs, and higher transportation associated pipe rail and truck capacity. And lastly, Ilim delivered sequentially stronger results on higher pricing and solid demand. Relative to our segment performance, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on page 12. As I already mentioned, we realized meaningful price gains in containerboard exports and solid demand across all international channels, backstopped by record shipments in North America box. Baseline operations improved sequentially as well, even excluding the non-repeating items of both the hurricane impact in the third quarter and the benefit of the final tranche of Pensacola insurance recovery of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Maintenance outage expense decreased by $10 million as we had our lowest maintenance outage quarter of the year. And input cost improved as OCC pulled back from the third quarter historical high. Although partially offset by seasonally higher wood costs and very difficult transportation operations, primarily availability, which again reflects the strong underlying demand environment, which we are experiencing. Taking a closer look at our Industrial Packaging business in the fourth quarter. Our margins expanded meaningfully, as expected, driven by several factors. First, we continue to see strong global demand for our corrugated packaging, as reflected by record shipments in North America box and containerboard exports in the fourth quarter. Second, our multi-channel go-to-market strategy continues to be an important driver of our platform performance. These channels to market, which include the integrated box business and our domestic and export containerboard segment, provide choices for International Paper to maximize value. This was especially evident in the fourth quarter where we saw a significant margin expansion, largely due to higher realized prices. And lastly, I want to address our industrial packaging mill optimization initiatives. We've now brought online about half of the 250,000 tons of capacity we announced in 2015. This added capacity is not only providing us with the needed flexibility to optimize our product and geographic mix, it has enabled us to keep up with strong and steady market growth, no more apparent than in the fourth quarter. So now, moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on page 14. This business delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, with earnings of $98 million and an EBITDA margin of nearly 23%. This was driven by outstanding commercial performance, driving price and mix improvement across the portfolio. We continue to see strong demand across all grades, but particularly in our fluff segment. Executing our plan to qualify our Riegelwood 18 machine on fluff on an accelerated basis allowed us to serve the growing demand from our customers and increase our mix towards more fluff pulp, ultimately providing margin uplift better than planned. And on the synergy front, we again accelerated our realizations in the fourth quarter. And I will come back to that with some more color on the next slide. Moving on, and with full transparency, fourth quarter operations did benefit by $15 million from the inventory valuation associated with our LIFO accounting convention. And maintenance outage expenses remained low during the fourth quarter. And input costs were moderately higher on seasonal wood costs. All in, we are very pleased with the progress made integrating the Global Cellulose Fibers business. And just to make one underlying before we move on, we are extremely well positioned to service our customers globally and have made outstanding progress in bringing synergies to the bottom line. I do want to point out though, as we enter 2018, we do have higher maintenance expenses planned. And we will have a significant step-up in corporate allocations to this business, impacting reported results only at the segment level. Turning to slide 15 and taking a closer look at Global Cellulose Fiber synergies. The business delivered very strong performance in the fourth quarter, capturing $53 million across the enterprise and bringing the full year to $155 million. You will recall that our original 2018 exit target was $175 million, which we then revised upward to $200 million. We can say proudly that we are closing 2017 at $205 million run rate, exceeding our target a year ahead of plan. In summary, we are capturing more synergies faster, exceeded our target and, therefore, have executed in a central pillar of our earnings growth commitment associated with this acquisition. With that, we officially close out our synergy reporting and move to the next step of further optimization. And as you can see in the table, meaningful optimization opportunities are still in front of us in 2018 and beyond, particularly in manufacturing supply chain operations. Moving to Printing Papers. Results came in better than expected on improved commercial performance, particularly in Brazil, where we benefited from stronger-than-expected seasonal volume gains, better mix, directly correlated with higher domestic net demand. We also saw realization in the quarter across all our paper segments, confirming more recent initiatives have good traction on price. Maintenance outage expenses were higher than the third quarter, as expected. And input costs were impacted by higher wood costs, particularly in Russia operations, as well as higher pulp costs in Brazil. So coming back to North America, our operations were impacted by seasonally higher operating costs and unusually cold weather, as well as higher distribution cost due to the constrained availability of trucking options in this environment. Now, on to Ilim on page 17, that JV delivered very solid results, driven by higher pricing and strong volumes, only partly offset by higher seasonal wood and energy costs. There were no maintenance outage expenses during the quarter. And our equity earnings benefited from a non-cash FX gain on the JV's US-denominated debt. Turning to the balance sheet, on page 18. During 2017, although we expected, we delivered step-change progress towards bringing our leverage ratio back to our stated target of less than 3 times debt to EBITDA on a moving adjusted basis. Our pension gap decreased by $1.4 billion on a $1.25 billion voluntary pension contribution, which was partially funded by a $1 billion debt issuance at very attractive terms. Internal to the plan, very strong pension plan investment returns were only partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate. Further, and as I've - we discussed earlier, during 2017, we took meaningful measures to derisk the plan, including transferring approximately $1.3 billion of pension benefit obligations to a third party, effectively reducing the cost of our PBTC insurance premiums. Going forward, we will remain fully committed to a strong balance sheet. And as we enter 2018, we will continue to deleverage by paying down additional debt in order to meet our commitments and sustain our investment-grade credit rating. On slide 19, I want to take this opportunity to update you on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to International Paper. First and foremost, with regard to border tax policy, our position has been clear. Tax policy should help drive economic growth and level the playing field with competitors around the world. While a lot has been achieved here, we continue to evaluate the impact of these significant changes and many smaller changes to International Paper. But there is no question, the main impact to us is the headline corporate tax rate, which moves from 35% to 21%. Correspondingly, you will notice that we recognized a $1.2 billion non-cash benefit in special items in the fourth quarter, which includes the remeasurement of our US deferred taxes to the new corporate tax rate. I'll remind you that we do not have any US federal NOL carryover. So essentially, International Paper is a full taxpayer of tax. Of course, we also pay state and local taxes, which takes our projected global operational tax rate to approximately 25% to 27% in 2018. Another important impact of the tax reform to International Paper is the accelerated depreciation, which will allow us to develop the full amount of our US-based capital investments within the same year through 2022 versus 50% previously. Lastly, relative to the repatriation of cash, also known as the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, this means we are no longer taxed when bringing cash back from our foreign subsidy. With that said, we do have to pay for this flexibility. And we currently estimate this cost, net of foreign tax credits, to be approximately $200 million to be paid over the next eight years. Net-net, however, this flexibility is a strong positive to International Paper. All in, we expect a positive cash tax impact exceeding $200 million in '18 and beyond. Now, turning to our first quarter outlook on page 20. We expect to see a $10 million benefit from additional price realization in containerboard exports and a $5 million benefit on improved pricing in our Paper segment associated with announced 2017 increases. Volume will be down seasonally versus the fourth quarter as we go into this normally slower period and, therefore, expect a $40 million impact in North America Industrial Packaging and a $20 million impact in Brazil paper. We will also see a modest decrease in Global Cellulose Fibers of about $10 million, driven by the impact of Chinese New Year. Our North American mill operation is affected by the severe weather experienced at the beginning of this year, summing to a cumulative impact of $35 million, primarily in our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. And also, recall that during the fourth quarter, our North American Industrial Packaging business had a $14 million insurance recovery payment for Pensacola. And our Global Cellulose Fibers business had a $15 million benefit for inventory valuation, LIFO. But this is more about timing. And neither of these items will repeat in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we will also see $15 million higher cost in our European packaging business, primarily related to the Madrid mill startup. Given our uneven outage schedule, planned maintenance outage expenses will increase by $145 million in the first quarter. And further, input costs will be a headwind of $35 million across our business, driven by our higher wood, energy, and transportation costs. Lastly, in the other items category, we include corporate expense, interest expense, tax rate, and the equity earnings from our Ilim JV and our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. Although here that our equity earnings from Graphic Packaging will be before tax. And the effect of approximately 1% is included in our tax outlook. Net-net, we are off to a strong start in the first quarter, despite seasonal and timing noise. And our confidence in the full year remains robust. Turning to slide 21. You can see some of our key planning assumptions for 2018. As stated previously, we expect higher maintenance outage expenses due to the impact of an 18-month cycle and extended averages at several mills, all of which is an investment in the future, as we position them for longer maintenance cycle schedules, saving cost in future periods. For more specificity, you can find the 2018 quarterly maintenance cost by business on page 27 of the appendix. And as has become the norm, it is important to point that more than 70% of our average are planned during the first half of the year. Relative to capital expenditures, we have allocated $1.5 billion for 2018, including $500 million in strategic capital, as we fund value-creating opportunities in our core growth businesses, which I will discuss further on the next slide. Lastly, please note our estimates for D&A, interest expense, corporate items, and our new effective tax rate. Slide 22 shows additional details on our $1.5 billion capital investment priorities for 2018. Approximately, $900 million will go toward maintenance and regulatory projects to maintain our safe and sustainable world-class mill system of low-cost advantage assets, ultimately keeping the lights on with added benefits of improved liability. Further, we will also invest $100 million in high-return cost-reduction projects where we have a healthy pipeline in our core businesses with IRRs of 30% or greater, which we will fund over time to optimize our advantage assets. And lastly, we will invest $500 million in strategic projects with healthy spreads above our cost of capital. These include, for example, the Madrid Mill conversion from newsprint to lightweight recycled containerboard, where we'll see the benefit starting in the second half of the year. And a recently announced Riverdale machine 15 conversion from uncoated freesheet to virgin white top containerboard with a total capital investment of $300 million over 2018 and 2019. Again, we are taking this additional step to unbundle our capital expenditures to scale and emphasize the meaningful shift to value creation in our growth businesses. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Glenn. We are very pleased with the progress we made in 2017 and, as I mentioned earlier, with the momentum we're carrying into 2018. We're confident in another year of 10% plus EBITDA growth, driven by continued strong outlook in our core businesses and the full year price flow-through of 2017 increases. We continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our portfolio. We're making great progress on our optimization initiatives, as we improve our world-class manufacturing system. We have great customers in all of the important segments in the businesses that are core to International Paper. In addition to our EBITDA growth, we're also confident about our equity investment outlook. The Ilim JV is well positioned for another strong year performance. And we will start to see the benefits of our investments in Graphic Packaging. All in, we expect another year of strong cash generation. And we'll continue to allocate capital to grow value for our shareholders. And with that we'll open up the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. Lars Kjellberg : Yes. Good morning. And thanks for all the details. I just wanted to have a couple of clarifications on the input cost. You talked about $0.60 for the full year 2017. Do you have any sense where you're going to get through 2018? And also, if you can comment a bit on fluff prices. There's, obviously, some degree of time lag. So should we not have expected a bigger positive from pricing and fluff in the first quarter? Mark Sutton : Why don't we start with that first? And I'll turn that over to Jean-Michel. Jean- Michel Ribieras : Good morning. Fluff prices, as you know, as always, I've mentioned, some time difference. And we actually [indiscernible] reason and also price increase for February. So we mostly expect to see the benefit of these price increases in Q2. We did announce this month a price increase in Q4. But it was only captured and officially reported this month. So again, I think some of the announcements we had in Q4 were not clearly taken. And because now they are officially, I think, we will see the benefits in Q2, but not in Q1 - or very small in Q1. Lars Kjellberg : Okay. Mark Sutton : So, Lars, can you repeat the question on input - Lars Kjellberg : Yeah, you talked about a $0.60 hit, I guess, in one of the references you made in the presentation. Could you kind of - yeah. So how do you think input cost - what sort of impact do you see for the full year in 2018? Mark Sutton : Well, in the full year in 2018, what we spoke to is $35 million across our businesses, driven by higher wood, energy, and transportation costs. Lars Kjellberg : No, I appreciate that. But if you kind of look at a full-year basis, I suppose just the first quarter. Do you have any view on - Mark Sutton : On a full-year basis, we're looking - go ahead, please. Glenn, would you want to refine that? Glenn Landau : No, Lars. What we've outlined is the 35, we've outlined the first quarter. And we are continuing to refine as we look forward for the balance of the year. Lars Kjellberg : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just one clarification on the guidance. The 10% EBITDA growth and then a couple of price increase announcements in the last week or two and a number of new different product rates. Just wondering if that's contemplated in the guidance, or if you think you can get to that sort of an EBITDA growth level even before the impact of those price increase announcements, recognizing that even if they did happen, they will be impacting you more later in the year? Glenn Landau : Yeah. I think our outlook is based on our exit rate performance and our initiatives. And we don't include any outlook of initiated increases in that number. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks for that. And just a question on the balance sheet. You're getting a little closer to your leverage targets. The pension looks like it's in pretty good shape. I think you've outlined before, not a lot of cash needs there. And you're obviously getting a fair amount of money - a benefit from the tax law change. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on uses of cash, going forward, so we see the dividend maybe move up in line with some of the - giving some of the cash tax benefits back to the shareholders. Any kind of priorities you've got for use of cash at this point? Mark Sutton : Brian, this is Mark. That's a great question. And if you think about our capital allocation framework, we don't plan on changing that framework. It's a balanced framework with shareholder return through dividend and occasional share buyback, with balance sheet maintenance to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, investment-grade, as Glenn mentioned in his remarks. And a certain amount of that cash we generate for strategic projects, small acquisitions, things that are creating value across the Company. So a tax saving flows more into free cash flow. That free cash flow goes through that balanced framework, just as it did before. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just one last one for Glenn. Just on the cash tax rate. I think you mentioned you get some accelerated depreciation benefits. Any guidance on how that would compare to the book tax rate of 25% to 27%? Glenn Landau : All in. So we factored all of the points I related to earlier into that new effective tax rate. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Landau : Good morning. Mark Wilde : First, just coming back on that question Brian just asked. So what would the cash tax rate be, Glenn, in '18 and '19? Do you have any guidance on that? Glenn Landau : Mark, we don't give guidance on the cash tax rate. But I underlined that we are a full taxpayer. The incremental savings due to the tax reform is around $200 million a year. And roughly, you can think about that as a third of our tax obligation. Mark Wilde : Okay. I want to just step over to kind of capital spending in light of the - some of the tax law changes and also in light of a weaker dollar. And I'm just wondering whether these changes are going to affect your kind of capital spending cadence over the next few years, given the fact that you can accelerate the depreciation on new capital programs and also whether it's going to pivot IP back more towards a domestic focus? Glenn Landau : Well, Mark, we have a balanced approach, as we speak too often, in terms of our capital allocation. Clearly, we've unbundled our strategic capital projects. And we've already oriented them to our core businesses of Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, where most of those assets are in North America. So we were moving in that direction earlier. And it's accelerated depreciation and just helps us along those lines. Mark Sutton : Yeah. And I would add that the cadence of capital is really driven by the opportunity to get returns and the demand signal we have for the businesses we are in. Where we spend it? Obviously, our regions compete on returns. So there could be an opportunity to do more cost reductions sooner, for example, in a US asset than somewhere else. But we're not going to spend more capital because of the depreciation change. It's going to change the economics of some of the capital we spend. But it will all be based on solid strong returns and a demand signal that says, our customers need better products or more products. And on the internal side, we've got lots of opportunity across the entirety of International Paper to get better on the cost and productivity side. Mark Wilde : I guess, kind of following on that, Mark, then. In your biggest business, in the Industrial Packaging business, the box volumes have picked up pretty markedly over the last 18 months from what we had seen over the last several years. Is that a change in the demand signal in your view? Or is that just a cyclical element? Mark Sutton : I think it's a change in the demand signal, if you look at the absolute growth of the box market. But you have to remember, converting capacity is very flexible. So with the system, the size, and the geographic scope of IP, we have had the capacity to address that in our box-making operations. Where you've seen us add some capacity starting with way back with the valiant restart is adding containerboard capacity to match more of the box demand we're seeing through all three of our channels. Most importantly, our own box channel, where most of our containerboard goes. So that is true demand. And our box plants in certain regions are a lot busier. We've hired people. We've added shifts. We're creating jobs in areas where we have entire shifts of business that we didn't have before. So again, matching what our customers want with our core capabilities and doing it all in a profitable way is what drives all of these investment decisions. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then, lastly, just on - one of the capital elements is this Selma conversion, which I think you've talked about is $300 million. But according to some stuff in the trade press, you've talked about a $500 million investment in some local meetings down in Alabama. And I just wondered whether that's like money that you're spending in kind of preparation for the second machine conversion down there, or the trade press just has it wrong? Glenn Landau : Ultimately, Mark, you just need to focus on the $300 million. That's what's associated with this project. Timothy Nicholls : Yeah, I think, Mark - this is Tim. The other is normal maintenance and regulatory spending, which will be done in - over a long period of time. So we're going to try $300 million in specific for the project. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris Manuel : Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you. And, I guess, to kind of come back to the cash tax component. I appreciate you're not necessarily given that guidance that way. But we're trying to, I guess, get a sense of the differential. So when we think of the $1.5 billion you're spending this year in '18 - and I think it's going to be a pretty chunky number next year - what portion would be US-based that we'd be able to accelerate the depreciation on? Or how would we think about that? Glenn Landau : It's going to be the lion's share. You could count on $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion on a run rate basis. Chris Manuel : Okay. So in short, then we would expect, at least for the next year or two, that the cash tax rate probably is a little below book then? Would that make sense? Glenn Landau : We're not going to forecast that. But the $1.2 billion will be the write-off on that capital. Chris Manuel : Okay. Thank you. And then, my second question was, when we look at box - to Mark's question earlier - box has picked up a bit the last few years. But when we look at, particularly just even this last quarter, I think your volumes were modestly higher or still continuing to lag a bit. I get that at times, things happen to flow. But how would you have us think about on a go-forward basis that - I think most of us are kind of looking for box shipments with the economy getting better and with eCommerce and different components being 2% to 4%. How would we think about IP participating in that? Should be anticipate that you'll kind of be at industry rate? Should we anticipate maybe there's some leakage there? Or how would you have us think about it? Timothy Nicholls : So, over - hi, this is Tim. Over time, we expect to be at market rate. And they do have been slow. And I think you saw in the second half of the year, we started picking up just through normal churn of business and customer wins. But we saw really strong demand right through the end of the year. And it's continuing in January. Chris Manuel : Okay. And just a sense of what January is out for you? Glenn Landau : Right - through January and their preliminary numbers, but we were up a little bit over 4% in January. Chris Manuel : Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Yes, good morning. Just a couple questions. First, you mentioned that the fluff business or cellulose business would get a bigger part of the corporate allocation. Can you let me know how much per quarter roughly that will be in 2018 versus 2017? Mark Sutton : Okay. Yeah, think about 30 million of new allocated for the full year. Chip Dillon : Okay. And then on the pension. Just to be clear, you show that you got the ratio down to 3.3. Is it really a little below the 3 times around there, because I believe you didn't get the proceeds from the consumer sale till after the first of this year. So if you adjust for that, it's even lower or was it already adjusted? Glenn Landau : it's already adjusted. Chip Dillon : Okay. Got you. And then last thing Glenn, you mentioned that the unlimited tax payments that you have to make would total about $200 million over the next 8 years net of credits. Now, I guess it's fair to say you probably could use those credits at some other point and if that's true, sort of, what was the gross amount, was it closer to say $300 million or $400 million? Glenn Landau : We haven't disclosed that - it's a meaningful number. But this is the net. Chip Dillon : Okay. And then I guess the last thing is on the - in the fluff business, I think you - if you could just repeat what you said would be some of the changes going from the 4th to the first. I know was the inventory write-up, could you explain how that works. Is that a function of what pricing was doing. And is that something that could repeat in future years. Guillermo Gutierrez : Repeat the question. Chip Dillon : You remember the fluff you had inventory benefit in cellulose, I should say a $15 million from an inventory. I guess a positive or credit. And could you just let us know how that worked and if that would likely repeat? Mark Sutton : Sure. Chip. Certainly that's something we measure over time and it's somewhat hard to forecast, but that's a one-time that's LIFO. It's a one-time event true up we do on annual basis in the 4th quarter. Chip Dillon : Okay Got you. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, and good morning. Thanks for all the details. And congratulations on the progress in '17. I wanted to come back to the question on box volume. And I know you've made progress in this regard. But the 0.3% volume growth really is more, when we think about it, emblematic of the growth rates we were seeing prior to eCommerce hitting stride, whatever would have been, at least gaining critical mass, a year and a half ago. So is there something underlying in the business, Tim, that's caused the greater growth to be flatter, perhaps, than we would have expected, considering especially your strong weighting with some of the larger etailers that are out there? Or was it very much as you had expected? And if it was as expected - part two of this question - IP, given its scale, given its size, given its position as number one, we probably would expect not initially lead the market every quarter. But it has generally trailed most of the publicly reported companies in terms of box growth over a number of periods. So when should we expect - should we expect that gap to ever close? Thanks. I had a couple of follow-ons. Timothy Nicholls : Sure. Hey, George. Yeah. I mean, we did trail in '17. We performed in line '16. We had some customer turnover. We made some choices, started picking up business in the second half of the year. So it was in line with our expectation in what we thought we would do with our customer base. And I think it will continue ramping as we go through the first part of '18. George Staphos : Okay. Fair enough. And you expect to be able to maintain more of an industry growth rate, recognizing - there are no guarantees in life. You need to monitor month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter. But from what you'd see right now, there is no reason why you shouldn't be at least trending with the industry over 2017. Would that be a fair assessment? Timothy Nicholls : Yeah, I would put it this way. Our expectation is we will do it over time. I mean, we'll pick our spots in terms of how we look at margin. And we will make choices from time-to-time where we think we are making the right decision for maximizing sustainable margins. George Staphos : Okay. That's fair. Thank you for going through that. I don't know if you can comment to this. But nonetheless, there's been some discussion in the trade press about International Paper being out with a containerboard price hike to customers. Can you comment as to whether you've been notifying customers in that regard, or where you stand in terms of any pricing action in containerboard in North America? Timothy Nicholls : No, I really can't, George. We can't for our customers. George Staphos : Okay. Fair enough. And, I guess, the last question I had to start - I mean, the bigger picture. Actually, two questions and then we'll turn it over. First, you mentioned - again I think within the box business that you've been pleased with your commercial performance over time. How do you measure your commercial performance? Is it just the timing of what you get the containerboard price into the market? Is it margin in boxes? I know you can't discuss too much live, Mike. But how do you evaluate your commercial performance and which is suggesting your view that you've been doing well in that regard? And the bigger picture question is, going back a number of years ago, there was a much larger EBITDA target that the Company had been hoping for. And obviously, the markets and the Company's portfolio have changed such that maybe that's not we should ever be thinking about anyway. But what other things can IP do that would step-change directionally the EBITDA closer to that 5 number than where it's currently been and, obviously, been making progress? What would you have us think about? Is there an Analyst Day, perhaps, coming up where you might be able to talk to that? Thank you, guys. And good luck in the quarter. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. There was a lot wrapped up there. And let me try to go back to the first part and unbundle some of it. I think, at a macro level, we look at margins. We look at - not just on box, but how we think about all the channels that we operate in. And growth is a piece of that margin. Price is a piece of that margin structure, cost is also. On a more granular level, it comes down to customer-by-customer and understanding our customers' needs, understanding where we can deliver value propositions that are meaningful to them. And we do that across our portfolio of customers. So we do it high level. And we do it right down to how do we execute with any specific customer. Timothy Nicholls : George, I'll take the second part on the $5 billion that we shared back in 2012. You're right. The Company is a significantly different company than we were back then. And I think the way we get the EBITDA grow and it's put together years like we had in 2017 with double-digit EBITDA growth. And we think we'll do that again in '18. And positioning the Company to have high returns. So our returns today, return on invested capital, for every bit where we said they would be at the $5 billion. What we haven't done is delivered. That's not the number to think about. The number to think about is growing International Paper from where we are and maintaining a solid spread in actual returns above our cost of capital and that's, we think, the best way to create long-term value. So we position the Company to have our strongest business, get the most resources. And we position the company to have a growth profile. It's not a high-growth profile, but a growth profile with packaging and a growth profile with cellulose fibers. And I think if we put that together, we'll have more opportunity to create more value than even the Company that we just described in 2012. George Staphos : Thanks for all the thoughts, guys. ' Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thank you. Good morning. Glenn Landau : Good morning, Steve. Steve Chercover : First of all, freight is becoming a hot topic again. And a few years ago when it was tight, the industry raised their inventories. And I'm just wondering if you could - and I'm not sure that you can - would you do so again? Timothy Nicholls : Hey, David, it's Tim. Let me just speak to Industrial Packaging. What we're trying to do is make sure that we have the capability to service our customers when they need to be serviced. So fourth quarter was a lot of commotion - rail lines not running as effectively as we would have liked them to, knock-on effect between rail lines, knock-on effect to trucking, complications from structural issues in trucking itself. But we did, given our capability, service all of our customers. And so, we were able to sort through that. But for me, thinking about - it's not a level of inventory, it's the capability. And we produce thousands of SKUs for 15,000 to 20,000 customers. And making sure we have the right thing in the right place at the right time is how we go about managing our system. Mark Sutton : Yeah. I think, Steve, I'll add on to Tim and speak for the rest of the Company beyond Industry Packaging. When we think about inventories, it's one of the choices we had in our value chain. And so, when everything is working great in transportation area, the velocity of the inventory is moving, the levels tends to be lower. If there are bottlenecks somewhere in the value chain, then that's a use of cash to have more inventory and spend less on emergency transportation. The whole goal is to serve the customers' needs. And so, absolute inventory numbers are not certainly designed to velocity that inventory through the system and meeting customer expectations at profitable levels as what we designed to. And we have the supply chain systems in place, people. So we were organized what we've centralized, what we haven't, and the IT systems to underpin and to be able to do that. Steve Chercover : Yeah. I appreciate that. Because it seems to me that people look at inventories in isolation, and it's just one factor to service customers and maximize profits. Thanks. So then, one other question on - especially on cellulose. Pulp prices continue to go up. And the discount between list and mill net is starting to narrow. And was that part of the synergy capture that you mentioned? Jean- Michel Ribieras : Hi, it's Jean-Michel speaking. We are maximizing our customer. It's exactly like in packaging. We're going to the best segments where our customers look at the long term, where they value the products we do, especially the big portfolio of products we do. We don't have one fluff specialty. We have niche products of fluff. So this is even more important actually than the 1%, 2% discount change or whatever. We have a lot of customers. Now, we actually sell net prices, don't have discounts anymore. So the optimization is much more a capacity to answer our customer needs, both in terms of products and innovation. And when you look at our growth in sales - and let's thank our customer - because we have had record fourth quarter. We've had a very nice year in terms of growth. The market is continuing to have a very strong demand. And we are winning in this market. So I think this is clearly the main point. And just to be clear, in the synergy, you don't have pricing. Pricing is not in the synergy. So what you do have is mix improvement, for example. Let me give you an example. [indiscernible] got no more capacity at warehouses. We had Riegelwood 18. Between the knowledge of our innovation center and the knowledge of International Paper, we're able to qualify Riegelwood much faster than we ever thought about it. And Riegelwood 18 is a very big success in the market. And today, the machine is producing about 10% more than the initial investment. And the machine is fully qualified. And for this year, it's sold out. This is well ahead of what we had planned. And that's one of the synergy we've had of getting together. But not pricing. There is no pricing in synergy. Steve Chercover : That's terrific. Okay. merci, Jean-Michel. And thank you, everyone. Jean- Michel Ribieras : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Mark, just - first one question was, how are you, treating the Consumer Packaging and Graphic when you're giving off the EBITDA guidance of 10% plus 2018 versus 2017? Glenn Landau : Basically, it's excluding Consumer. Consumer is a discontinued operation. And our 10% plus is from the new base. Mark Weintraub : Okay. So if I understood you correctly, you said that the - that EBITDA guidance included nothing for the containerboard anchor depreciate or pulp price initiatives that you also have underway. But that was just your exit. And so if I take 10% of your $3.7 billion, that's $370 million. And so, you just do the math of what that would be, and that's like $0.70 per share of accretion, all else equal. And then, additionally, we have that lower tax rate, which adds $0.25 from last year as well. And then, I guess, we'll have to factor in what we think will happen with Ilim and then whether Graphic/Consumer does better or not. Is that an appropriate framework to think about how you see 2018 playing out using the exit from 2017? Glenn Landau : Yeah. I think, in general, that's directionally correct. Certainly, any initiatives that have happened subsequent to the end of the year and not in the run rate are what we call the plus piece of that 10%. Mark Sutton : I think, Mark, the other thing to think about is, you get all top line changes that are all positive. The way it will work out, we just don't know exactly how. If all of that happens that you just described, that probably means a really strong economic environment when that happens. Lots of things are unpredicted like where inputs go, transportation we talked about earlier. So there is sometimes a margin squeeze on that strong economic background, comes with activity as it is value chain. So that's why - Glenn Landau : There's puts and takes. Mark Weintraub : Yeah. No, I appreciate that. It's a very fair point. And, I guess, just the one thing that is - I don't want to say different than. But on the 1Q guidance, you're giving - you're certainly calling for a lower profitability than - at least where expectations, I believe, by my quick math on it - than where people might've been expecting. But again, your full year doesn't seem to be doing that at all. Maybe talk a little bit about - and it does certainly seem like you have a lot of maintenance in the first quarter. That certainly could be a part of this. Glenn Landau : That's exactly it. I think we framed it as seasonally slow, heavy maintenance. And there are some non-repeats. The main message here is the full year that Mark underlined. And a new rate of 10% plus in this first quarter, as we've seen in the past, is timing. We feel good about the fundamentals in the first quarter. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Great. And then, very quickly, lastly. So the box shipment data came out this morning. And that showed average week up 0.4%, which - I was just curious what you had seen in December. It just seemed a little bit surprising, given there had been talk about how strong December in particular was, albeit against a relatively difficult comp. And - but for the full quarter, if you looked at the industry data, it wasn't actually that much ahead of yours. It's just like 1% on an average day basis. But again, a little bit antithetical to the notion that business is really good, which is what I'm hearing from everybody. Timothy Nicholls : Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's Tim. Yeah, our fourth quarter felt very strong. We see the box market is strong in the fourth quarter. We see it continuing in the first. And you mentioned that it was a tough comp. And if memory serves, I think it was the toughest comp of any month in the year. I believe December of '16 was close to 6% daily. And so, it was a beat on that comp in December. So I see it as a very strong market. Mark Weintraub : And can you share with us what your December - or your December specifically, what your comparison was? Glenn Landau : I don't have it on top of my head. You saw the quarterly number. But December was strong for us, led by eCommerce again, which was over 20% for us. So, yeah, we had a very strong December. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I've just got a couple of follow-up questions on cost. I think in the past you've talked about an manual labor inflation hurdle of $120 million to $230 million. Is that still a decent target for 2018? Or could you see something above that, given the tighter labor market in US? And then, on the 1Q outlook, you quantified the impact from energy, wood, and transportation. Is it possible to carve out how much of that was transportation or basically freight? Glenn Landau : Okay. Two questions. First one relative to inflation. I still think that's a good point that you mentioned relative to year-over-year inflation. We have contracts with employees. That's not going to change a lot in the near-term. The variability that we would see in other inflation would be more along the PPV lines. Relative to the guidance of $35 million of input headwinds, that's certainly wood, energy. But transportation is meaningful. It's certainly kicked in as the businesses have spoken to it, about constrained availability in the fourth quarter. We think that will continue in the first quarter and throughout the year. So I won't give you a percentage, just meaningful. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. And then, just switching to the 2018 outlook. One of the catalysts you identified was the Madrid startup. Can you remind us the timeline there? And then, more broadly, European Industrial Packaging, I think profit was negative in 4Q. As you look to 2018, what's kind of the timeline there for margin recovery and profitability in Europe? Glenn Landau : Well, that's a good question, Anthony. And clearly, as we have laid out, the Madrid mill is a big piece of that margin recovery. That gives us the vertical integration we were looking for in the recycled segment. It's going be a low-cost first quartile mill. Candidly, as we have laid out the time-frame here, it has been delayed somewhat, mostly just due to engineering scoping. But we feel good about the ultimate outcome. And we should see those benefits in the second half of the year. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi. Just two quick ones for me. I just wanted to confirm on the annual purchase for key inputs slide that the delta between last quarter and this quarter is primarily due to removal of the Consumer business. Just some of the numbers seemed like a pretty big shift like caustic, for example. And then, is this something that we would use then for assumptions for 2018, just give us a 2017 on it? Glenn Landau : So on the input slide in the appendix you're talking about, yes, those have all been adjusted for the removal of our discontinued operation of Consumer. And they would be good estimates for you. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thank you. And then, just - if you can just give us your updated comments on OCC. I didn't quite catch what rate you're assuming for your Q1 guidance. And just what you're seeing in the market right now in terms of what China is doing? Timothy Nicholls : Hey, Debbie, it's Tim. Permits have been granted. It feels like it will be somewhat flattish in the early part of the quarter. And then the best view we have from on the ground in China is that things would start accelerating again after Chinese New Year. I think you also have to consider this is one of the lowest generation times of the year. So it's what China is doing, it's what's happening with generation. And then, transportation going to have an impact as well, just trying to move fiber from one place to another. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. Operator : I'll now turn the conference back to Guillermo for closing remarks. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thanks, everyone, for taking time to join us this morning. As always, Michele and I will be available after the call. Our numbers are on slide 24 of the presentation. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Marcio Farid - UBS Brasil CCTVM SA Operator : Good morning. My name is Sera and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2018 International Paper Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Guillermo Gutierrez, you may begin. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Sera. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Landau, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation that you should take time to read including certain legal disclaimers on slides 2 through 7. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outlined on slide 2 of our presentation. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. As noted on slide 3, a reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2018 press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim Joint Venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide 4 provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. As indicated by the information on slides 5 through 7, International Paper's proposal to acquire Smurfit Kappa is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under Irish Takeover Rules, International Paper Management is prohibited from discussing any material information or significant new opinion that has not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in International Paper or Smurfit Kappa is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisor. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin the presentation on slide 8. International Paper delivered solid first quarter performance and strong year-over-year earnings growth. We continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our global businesses. Price realization momentum continues across all three of our businesses, and we remain focused on delivering differentiated and innovative solutions to the right segments and the right customers. Operationally, we executed well in a heavy maintenance outage quarter and managed through weather-related disruptions and other unusual events. We completed approximately 35% of our scheduled maintenance outages in the first quarter and we expect to have 75% of our total maintenance outages complete by the end of the second quarter. Transportation and other input costs were a headwind in the quarter with higher wood, chemicals and energy more than offsetting the lower recovered fiber or OCC cost. And on equity earnings, our Ilim joint venture in Russia delivered record performance. Turning to the financial results on slide 9. Revenue increased by nearly 10% year-over-year, reflecting strong commercial performance and solid global demand. This includes record first quarter shipments of Fluff & Specialties in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. EBITDA improved 19% year-over-year. This performance reflects the solid business fundamentals and margin expansion across our businesses. In fact, we had record first quarter EBITDA in Industrial Packaging. Total equity earnings were $95 million including our Ilim joint venture as well as our 20.5% ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. Cash from operations improved by $30 million year-over-year, while free cash flow decreased, largely due to the fact that we spent nearly one-third of our $1.5 billion 2018 capital plan during the first quarter. I'll now turn it over to Glenn who will cover performance across our businesses and our second quarter outlook. Glenn? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide 10 in the presentation, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.94 bridged sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year as well as our 2017 first quarter results of $0.56 as a year-over-year reference. Operating earnings improved year-over-year largely due to $0.51 higher revenue driven by the flow through of pricing initiatives across all our segments as well as mix and volume growth. Sequentially from the fourth quarter, as you can see on the bridge, we saw continued price and mix gains of $0.10 from both prior year and current increases. However, given seasonality, this was more than offset by softer volumes as expected. On a seasonal basis, although demand remains quite strong. As Mark mentioned, operations were impacted by weather disruptions, primarily frigid conditions across the east and heavy rainfall in the south, as well as other unusual events which ended up impacting the quarter by approximately $50 million or roughly $0.08 but will not repeat. A detailed reconciliation of these events is included on page 24 in the appendix. And while we are still evaluating potential insurance recovery, keep in mind these were discrete events with discrete deductibles, so any recovery is unlikely to be material. That said, our operations on balance performed well despite these upset conditions and in an otherwise very heavy planned maintenance outage quarter. Supply chain costs continue to trend higher due to very tight rail and truck availability as well as higher diesel fuel costs. And looking forward, it is hard to see much relief here, so we believe this headwind will linger. On fiber, lower OCC costs were largely offset by seasonally higher wood costs, and energy and chemicals were higher sequentially. Lastly, Ilim delivered sequentially higher equity earnings and we also reported equity earnings from Graphic Packaging of $8 million, which was offset by purchase accounting deductions of approximately $6 million in the quarter. Moving now to our segment performance, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on slide 11. The business delivered a record first quarter result of $464 million EBIT despite weather and unusual events and heavy planned outages. Both domestically and globally we continue to see strong demand across our channels to market with export containerboard up approximately $40 per ton sequentially and continued flow through in domestic box. As expected, volume was seasonally soft, but we were in a position to repatriate volume from export markets to meet U.S. demand as our system remains oversold. Operations were $54 million lower versus the fourth quarter driven by weather events, which impacted results by approximately $31 million. The remainder was largely Pensacola insurance recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat. In terms of the heavy planned outages already referenced, we completed approximately 35% of our annual plan during the quarter including pulling up some work opportunistically at the mills impacted by the upset conditions. Lastly, higher wood costs for energy, chemicals, and transportation more than offset lower OCC costs in the quarter. Taking a closer look at segment positioning in the North America corrugated packaging market on slide 12, we outperformed the industry in the first quarter, largely due to our strong overweight positions in the fastest growing segments. And while our scale and footprint enables us to serve just about every corrugated segment in a material way across North America, our deliberate focus on the fastest growing segments, those benefiting from secular growth trends is paying dividends as we apply our vast network of packaging design and innovation expertise to meet and exceed our customers changing needs. Leading the way in both e-commerce and fresh produce and protein, our objective is to grow with these markets over time and to be well aligned with the market leaders in these segments. So turning to the next slide 13, our approach to innovation begins by fully understanding the needs of our customers through the value chain to the end customer. Across the business, we have segment specific innovation teams that work with our customers to develop value creating solutions. Pictured here, we have an award winning retail beverage display with immediate brand recognition, combining functional design with storage capability, while also very easy to move and reposition for maximum visibility. Our club store box with a tear out window for frozen protein that improves retail efficiency by simplifying restocking. In e-commerce box with impactful print inside that allows for added branding and enhances the cost to consumer unboxing experience, and a printed point of purchase bin for watermelon season. So these are just a few examples of solutions we bring to our customers every day. Moving to our Global Cellulose Fibers business on slide 14, we continue to see robust global demands, particularly in absorbance and specialties, which represents about 75% of our business. Pricing mix improved $12 million versus the fourth quarter and volume was down partially unexpected seasonality, but also unplanned lower shipments of NBSK from our Grande Prairie mill in Canada due to ongoing rail service issues, which have now been largely mitigated. Our North America pulp mill operations took the brunt of the weather disruptions, which impacted results by approximately $12 million in the first quarter and maintenance expenses were $50 million higher sequentially as we completed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year. All-in, we are very pleased with the strong performance and progress of the business, stepping up EBIT by $66 million versus the first quarter last year with record fluff shipments. Turning to slide 15, one of the most exciting aspects of the Global Cellulose Fibers business is our R&D capabilities. Our innovation engine is essential to how we create value for our customers and IP. It starts with our basic philosophy of global reach and local execution. Remember that we export approximately 85% of our North America production. Our business brings together a world-class technology center with leading industry experts and strong customer technical support networks. We create value by understanding and addressing customer needs through a robust product development process that currently has more than 1,000 patents. A very recent example of how we're bringing innovation to our customers is our new absorbent fiber called Elegance, which we launched in Asia last week. This innovative fiber is especially desirable for adult incontinence consumers who value discretion. And there's more to come, we have a rich product development pipeline underpinned by our unique capabilities and innovation engine that is well-positioned to create value for our customers and IP. All of which fuels the path to our target mix improvements. Moving now to Printing Papers on slide 16. We are now clearly seeing improving global demand. With the Southern Hemisphere and Eastern Europe more than offsetting slower secular declines in Western Europe and North America and in the North America supply demand balance, we see a backdrop that has improved significantly from last year and we continue to realize announced price increases. On an enterprise basis, price improved sequentially by $22 million and we see that as continued realization globally. Mix was a $9 million headwind unexpected seasonally lower demand in Brazil and volume was also seasonally lower in Latin America and Europe as expected. Operations were $8 million unfavorable, driven by weather impact in North America and unplanned downtime at our Kwidzyn mill in Poland. Distribution in North America continues to face headwinds, which we expect to continue as we explore improvement options. Also, like the other businesses, frontend loaded on outages, Printing Papers completed more than 35% of its scheduled maintenance outages in the first quarter and will complete nearly 85% by the end of the second quarter. Input costs were higher, primarily due to seasonal wood costs in North America and Europe, and higher purchase pulp cost in Brazil and Europe. But overall, we feel really good about our outlook in Printing Papers this year with a stronger demand environment and better industry fundamentals, all of which allows us to focus on our commercial excellence. Turning to slide 17, our Ilim joint venture generated record EBITDA and equity earnings in the first quarter with EBITDA margins of 43% and an annualized ROIC of more than 25% associated with our investments. During the quarter, we also received $160 million in dividends, representing another year of solid cash distributions. On slide 18 before moving to the second quarter outlook, we show our strong trend of revenue performance across all three of our business platforms on a year-over-year basis by quarter, looking through to the next quarter. We see the strong growth as a reflection of improving industry fundamentals and outcome of our customer product and geographical segmentation, we see this as sustainable, and importantly, early in this current phase of margin expansion. While price underpins a portion of this trend, volume and mix improvements are meaningful components as we focus on bringing differentiated value to our customers. Looking through to the end of this year, revenue growth will continue to accelerate in all three segments as we realize recent price increases grow and improve our mix. In fact, we expect a year-over-year CAGR in Industrial Packaging, Cellulose Fibers and Printing Papers to be 6%, 9%, and 4%, respectively from 2016 through the end of this year. Now, turning to our second quarter outlook on slide 19, in our Industrial Packaging Global segment, we expect to see a $25 million benefit from recent price increases in North America packaging and export containerboard. While mix is expected to be a $10 million headwind globally, volume is expected to increase seasonally with a benefit of $35 million. In operations, the non-repeat of the prior quarter's weather disruptions is expected to be a benefit of $28 million, which will partially offset, which will be partially offset by about $10 million, largely due to LIFO inventory revaluation charges on previously announced price increases. Outages will be $11 million higher and input costs expected to decrease by about $20 million. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect to see a $15 million benefit due to recent price increases and mix improvements. Volume will be sequentially flat with continued strong demand and a non-repeat of weather disruptions is expected to be a benefit of $12 million with a modest offset of $5 million due to higher distribution costs. Outage expenses will be $26 million lower, although still another heavy maintenance outage quarter. In our Global Printing Papers business, the benefit of recent increases and mix improvement is expected to be about $20 million and volume is expected to improve by $10 million on seasonally stronger demand globally. Operations will be flat quarter-over-quarter and maintenance outages will be higher by $11 million. You can see our outlook for Ilim JV and Graphic Packaging partnership on the equity row of the slide. And lastly, in terms of corporate and interest expense and as well our estimated effective tax rate, they remain consistent with our previous disclosures. So with that, now let me turn it over to Mark. Mark? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Glenn. We're very pleased with the performance in the first quarter and the momentum that we carry in 2018, which is underpinned by healthy demand and solid fundamentals globally. As Glenn mentioned earlier, we continue to see profitable revenue growth across our three businesses. We also have meaningful catalysts that will further improve our performance including the startup of the Madrid mill later this quarter, which will produce 400,000 metric tons of high performance lightweight recycled containerboard for our European packaging business. We also have more runway as we optimize our Global Cellulose Fibers business, which is already well ahead of our investment commitment, and in our papers business, we're seeing improved demand globally. Looking forward, we have clear line of sight to 10-plus-percent EBITDA growth and strong cash generation in 2018, with an improving trend of performance throughout the year. Before we open the call for questions, I recognize there's a high level of interest in our proposal to acquire Smurfit Kappa. At this point, there is no new information to share. We have a compelling proposal on the table and we're disappointed we haven't been able to engage with Smurfit Kappa. Relative to the Q&A session of this call, I'd like the focus on the quarter and the strong year we have ahead of us. With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on, as I look across, the main business here \u2013 thank you Guillermo for some of the new slides and some of the color. It looks like one of the things that isn't in there any longer, it's kind of the volume and the price per ton outlook that you used to provide in the back, perhaps could you give us some color as to you know where you are in realization of some of the price in the containerboard and in the cellulosic fiber business, what's and if perhaps you could remind us what yet you have announced out there yet, particularly on the pulp side, there seemingly is a new announcement everyday there but what IP's announced, and how we might see that flow through over the balance of the year? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Chris, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. I'll just make an overall statement about the pricing movement across the business as you mentioned. As we've said I think on the last call, we expect and we're seeing what we would say as a normal realization pattern both in the Industrial Packaging business and in the Cellulose Fibers business. But with some particulars, I'll ask Glenn to try to cover a couple of the particulars that you asked. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah, Chris. Hi, Glenn here. The way I would think about that is basically what we shared back in January was 10% plus EBITDA growth. And what we share there relative to pricing and volume was primarily the carryover of price increases that were implemented in 2017. You're absolutely correct, and as Mark said, we have had further announcements and we are implementing current prices. What we see there is those increases change our view, make it more confident in the 10% plus and we will see them roll out as scheduled through the remainder of the year as upside to our views. For example, the March 1 containerboard increase on boxes is a tailwind to the previous stated 10% plus or... Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And Chris, just a reminder on what I said about normal realization in that box price example that Glenn just referenced. It's normal for us across segments and the mix of customers that we have to see two to three quarters of our implementation until we get to full realization. And we expect that to be what plays out in this particular increase. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. This is incremental. That's where I was going with this as to what you've got there. Second question I had, Mark, and I appreciate you don't want a lot of questions about Smurfit on the call, but could you just perhaps give us a sense of the decision tree that you worked through with respect to timing? I mean, obviously, this isn't a bid that has a shelf life forever but kind of the decision tree as to when you feel you have to make a decision and then get back to run what you do on a regular day-to-day basis without the overhang? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, I appreciate the question, and as I mentioned at the start of the Q&A, there really isn't anything new to report on that. There's a process that we're in right now and we will continue to look at our options, but I'm not really at liberty to say what the next process or as you said decision tree is. Fundamentally though, if you look at the performance of the company, we're running the company very, very well and that's where our focus is right now. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I might have missed this, but I had a question probably more for Glenn on the equity income line. You mentioned or in the slides that basically it looks like almost all of the equity income, the $95 million, was from Ilim or said differently, only $3 million would have come from Graphic. And so could you just walk through why that apparently was only $3 million? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Chip, absolutely. So, subsequent to Graphic making their earnings release, we saw a number of $12 million. We got an estimate, a pre-estimate of that of $8 million and we had corporate accounting changes or corporate accounting adjustments that took $6 million off of that. So, the net-net is essentially $3 million that showed up, we'll true up the difference in further quarters. But that's essentially how we get to the math. You're right, the large percent of the $95 million is Ilim. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood. And it seems like that would be sort of their GAAP number and not their \u2013 if I'm not missing, if I have this right, and not their adjusted number. They basically had twice as much adjusted income as they had GAAP income. So, is it sort of fair to say that you didn't make that adjustment? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: We made our internal adjustment from the estimate given which was $8 million to get to the $3 million answer. Ultimately, we will true up in the future from a purchase accounting standpoint. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. There was no adjustment for going from reported to adjusted earnings, okay. And then, the next question is, just want to make sure I have this right. I think you called out \u2013 roughly looks like to me a little over $100 million in net positives going from the first to the second quarter, not including pricing and industrial and fluff, but not to make you go through all those numbers, but does that sound right, a little over $100 million on a pre-tax basis of net improvements in the three segments, not counting the price in those two segments? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. When you look at the bridge, ultimately the large portion of that is the revenue uptick across the businesses. So, yeah, directionally you're in the ballpark. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Just to clarify, so the numbers on the outlook which you gave, and they came fast and furiously, so I'm not sure I got all of them first time, but so they did not include any potential from fluff or the box price increase or they did? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: No, they absolutely did, Mark. So, our quarter-over-quarter look into the second quarter was holistic to include all our recent increases. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And I'm sorry, so on the Industrial Packaging side, what was the price mix number 2Q V 1Q? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. This is Mark Sutton. So, what Glenn outlined by business, I would encourage you to follow up with Guillermo and Michelle because they can walk you through all of that detail, but the number for Industrial Packaging, Glenn decided was $25 million due to recent price increases. There's also a number for Cellulose Fibers and for paper, but the IR team will be happy to go through that with you in detail. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, just lastly, wanted to also just clarify on that from the first question. So, the 10% plus in EBITDA that did not include benefit from incremental pricing, but I think on the question it was suggested is that, that would all be additive. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there other offsets so that we really can't do that simple math of the 10% and then whatever pricing have that additive? Just wanted to clarify that. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So, Mark what we said on the 10% EBITDA plus outlook 90 days ago was that it included flow through from previously announced 2017 pricing actions and our outlook on input cost and other elements at that point in time. Fast forward to now, we just discussed that there was a number of new price increases that are out there. There's also movement in some of the inputs. So, that's why there's a plus sign there, and you're right, those latest price increases that have been announced for 2018 were not considered in that original outlook. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: As well as any changes to inputs or volumes that you or we may see going forward. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. And I guess that's why I just wanted to focus on it. So, with that, today's point in time, would that be anticipated to be a partial offset or not necessarily? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Well, I think there's a net upside. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just a question on the Cellulose Fiber business. Just a little confused by the price benefit there. It seems like maybe not getting as much leverage to some of the price increases that we've seen, and I know discounting happens, but just wondering if there's just more of a delayed impact there, if we should expect the acceleration to come a little bit later in the year? And then, just sort of relate it to the weather outages in the quarter, some of that volume, it sounds like wasn't able to get out, but it was produced and it's just sitting there. So, does that mean you know we should expect a little bit more volume than normal as you get those shipments out the door and recognize that revenue? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Good question. Two points there, this is Glenn, relative to Cellulose Fibers. One on the first question is, is we're implementing price increases and I think I heard earlier there have been a lot of incremental price increases, we're realizing those as we expect to realize them, and yes depending on which channel to market, they have varying degrees of lag. So, a lot of this is still back end loaded in this year to the extent it was already announced and is being implemented. From a standpoint of your next question relative to... Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So what \u2013 what he asked about was volume and if there is going to be a catch up? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: So, the point there is at Grand Prairie as I said we had flow backs associated with supply chain interruptions. We lost volume there and we call that out in the summary section there. We are recovering from that, but that was a headwind and did cause us some loss volume in the first quarter. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I would say overall some of these products were qualified and we are the primary suppliers of the idea that we will have catch-up ability is definitely in our commitment to our customers. There's strong demand for the fluff and specialty segment of the product mix and also good demand for the special market pop like, what we make in Canada. So, good operations will allow us to get more of that product out to market, so we expect strong demand and some of that we'll be able to catch-up, there's no doubt. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And just a follow-on, you know, some of the industry box shipment data that's come out shows maybe a little bit of a deceleration from the trend we were on coming out of last year. Just wondering, if you're seeing that as well, maybe if you could kind of comment under April volumes, how they've been shaping up so far and then just sort of in general, do you think if there is any deceleration, is it weather driven, economically driven or just tougher comps, any kind of color you give there will be helpful? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think seasonally there're some changes in box demand. I guess, it depends on an individual customers' mix. I can only speak for IP, we see continued strong fundamentals and it's broad based across many segments. And recently, we've seen box demand, the traditional offset we've seen with GDP that gap has closed and we see for the foreseeable future that that's going to be a sustainable trend. So, it's pretty strong across the segments, wherein Glenn had shared a chart in the presentation around some of the segments and where we're underweight and overweight. If you dig into the sub-segments there and the customers that participate there, you can see what drove our slide over performance to the market. And so far this quarter, box demand remains very healthy and strong. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about where your inventories stand, both on the containerboard side, both in terms of all the outage issues in the quarter? There were press reports that you had lost or were talking about with customers 100,000 tons and relative to the tightness and the logistics side of things? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Sure, Gail. This is Glenn. Overall, as I indicated in the core presentation, our businesses in North America, but across the globe are sold out. We're not \u2013 we're running with any lack of order downtime and we're hand-to-mouth so to speak to meet our customer needs and that's been exacerbated by some of the upset conditions, weather related and otherwise, in the first quarter. And some of the supply chain constraints, like we talked about at Grand Prairie. So, again, we're \u2013 our supply chain is working incredibly hard to put what we need and what customers need in inventory to support their growth. But we're tight. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And going back to (32:46) a little bit. In the past, you've been willing to share kind of what your long-term modeling looks like and I'm just wondering if you could, I know you mentioned that would just tracking closer to GDP, but can you put some specific numbers to that and how that might have compared to this time last year? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We are seeing, I guess, from public information that trends right now look closer to GDP and that's a great outcome if that's sustainable. Clearly, some of the secular movements whether it's fresh food and e-commerce has closed that gap in the medium term to the extent you believe the runway on those secular trends that could be more than norm, but we're just going to have to see that play out. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And Gail, I would just add to Glenn's answer, on the long term planning, we never live in the moment of current demand, we look at a number of different things, so that we can plan appropriately our capability and the box plans, our capacity for container board, and so that long term planning still has a very rigorous look, and it almost always is a lower number than the moment that we're in unless the moment we're in is really low, so we don't, we don't confuse in the near term, we're happy to have the near term where we have it, but our long term and our investment plan is based on a much more sober look at the overall market, and but right now, we're lucky to be able to have the capability and the footprint to serve the demand while it's there. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Thanks very much. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details, as always. I had two questions, the first is really on the subject of your non-North American operations, we look at the paper business in, or let me rephrase it, on the one hand, North American paper, we look at the business and recognizing there is a firm amount of freight and maintenance outage burdened this quarter. Nonetheless, you know, generating a million or so of EBIT on the revenue that that segment does, does that suggest perhaps you need to take another look at this business strategically longer term, and then the related question, is getting ahead of myself, you know, when we look at the non-North American packaging businesses, again we see very modest EBIT on relatively large revenue gains. At some point, do we need to think about the strategy, the structure? Whether it's within Brazil or Europe in terms of your containerboard and Box business there? Thank you, guys. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thanks, George. This is Glenn, and those are both good questions. Relative to North America papers, we feel great about where we are, probably we feel as good as we have in the last decade in terms of the dynamic, again we acknowledge we're in secular decline and we don't think that rate of decline has changed materially. But what we do see is our good industry fundamentals. We are shipping less exports to meet U.S. demand, and quite frankly, there are less imports coming in. So, those are good signs. We have price traction. We do have headwinds, supply chain is a headwind, but that's something \u2013 somewhat in our control that we're going to manage and optimize. So, again, does this make us rethink of the business? No, I think this is a reinforcement that this is a cash generating business, it has the potential to \u2013 with our asset quality to draw up a lot of cash and we have assets that are very material to our other businesses. So, I think it's right in line with our strategy, but when you look at it holistically, given our geographic footprint, the printing papers around the world, it's a growth business when we're in a mid-cycle environment and we're certainly seeing that right now by the revenue growth over the last couple of years and into the future with Brazil and otherwise. Fair point on packaging outside of North America. We have positions obviously in Europe and South America. In Europe, we're augmenting that position with catalyst, which we believe is going to make a big difference in integration, our Madrid mill, and we're quite committed to our market access in Europe, but we have some squeeze now as a non-integrated player and that's why we're addressing that with some organic moves to do this conversion. Relative to Latin America, structurally we're somewhat impaired there, but we're growing our market access, we're building customer relationships, and I'm not going to open up a can of worms here relative to our aspirations globally, but clearly, we see fit to improve our market access in those very profitable pools around the world through acquisitions if we can do it at the right price. George Leon Staphos - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, I want to just follow up on George's second question there and talk about the international container board operations. Can you, A, give us some sense of kind of the sequencing on Madrid ramp up and sort of how you think about that in the context of what looks like an awful lot of new supply coming in Europe over the few years. And then, secondly, down in Brazil, the business is EBITDA negative. It's been five years since you bought that business, what's a reasonable timeline to be generating reasonable returns in Brazil? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Two good questions, Mark. I appreciate them. Relative to Madrid, we have line of sight. Clearly, there were some obstacles, largely due to labor and management of that labor in Spain, but Madrid is now looking to be ramping up by the end of this quarter and we feel great about that. That addresses a primary concern. Understand the backdrop of new capacity, but we also like the growth quotient in Europe, so a lot of that new capacity we think will be absorbed by growth. The good news for International Paper is our mill is 100% integrated at day one. So, we get to keep that margin, which is meaningful now given where OCC's at in Europe and around the world. So, again, we feel it is a big step forward for our business in Europe. Orsa continues to struggle but improve. There's year-over-year improvement two years in a row here. We're focused on our customers. We're cautious on capital allocation. So, it's really about understanding market access and understanding how to navigate Brazil in a non-recessionary environment. Line of sight, we think we have line of sight to an EBITDA positive business, that certainly isn't a return that's acceptable to us, and we'll make decisions and keep our options open on how we operate across Latin America. But clearly, we see Latin America as a profit pool we want to be a part of. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hey, Steve. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: So, you had some extraordinary items in Q1 that were more extraordinary than normal. And you said it hit the quarter by about $0.08 and you also moved some maintenance forward. Can you quantify that on the maintenance front, either in dollar terms or in percentage terms? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah, we can, and what we talked about was the cost headwinds. There were some volume headwinds as well on that 50%. We talked about Grand Prairie maybe as another issue. But yes, of the $0.08 hit, that's going to be a non-repeat. The pull forward predominantly in Industrial Packaging, let's say that's about $15 million of outages out in the second quarter that'll come in that have already been taken care of. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. That's great. And then also a question on the Riverdale conversion. How is that going? And when does the free sheet machine there get turned off, so to speak? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: So, Riverdale is on track. We have not disclosed specifically our point at which we pull the plug. We are ultimately going to time that with the engineering and time that with market demand. But as we outlined and disclosed from a macro standpoint, we're right on track with the project and we'll keep updating you as we go along. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Steve, what we did I think when we announced a project, we talked about it being online, which would obviously mean the conversion would take the uncoated free sheet somewhere in the middle to second half of 2019, and right now, that's still our current thinking. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you both. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glenn, you talked earlier about OCC being low around the world. I just want to follow up on that. What are your longer term views along those lines? I know some have been of the view that OCC has to go up over time because of some eventual global fiber shortage, but we obviously have not seen evidence of that as of late. So, can you just talk about what your view is to the extent you have a strong view along those lines? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I think we do have a fairly firm view long-term and I appreciate you framing it long-term, because short-term is a lot more complicated answer. But long-term, it comes down to if you believe in global growth and the fact that boxes ultimately will facilitate that global growth that there will be strong demand for recovered fiber and there will be pressure on that important substrate over time. We suggest in any medium term period it can be quite volatile. This definitely impacts the trade today, forcing even different fiber streams to meet some of the needs. We'll watch it closely. We still remain very confident in North America that our low cost virgin position is a winner, but we see OCC a strategic, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And the good news, Adam, is we're located both in Europe and in North America and Brazil for that matter where it's produced. So, ultimately, we have the first access. So, we have the right to first supply, the rest of the world's growth has to come from our region. So, again, in any medium term situation, we'll have access, and over the long-term, to your original question, we see you know, incremental pressure. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sure. Why not? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Adam, I'll just add \u2013 just a high level statement around what you would have to believe to arrive at the view Glenn just described. If you believe in global growth of fiber based packaging, then you understand that OCC is going to become more and more valuable. If you look at where a lot of the growth is occurring and the source of OCC of course is a box that starts with virgin tree fiber. So, we believe in global growth, and fiber based packaging enhance the value that OCC is going to play long-term in that value chain is going to be pretty important. That should lead to a commodity that's worth a lot more. But there's always going to be dislocations like what's happening in China, but cleaning it up is the right thing to do. But it's going to cost money to do it, but it's still the best solution for that type of packaging. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. And just aside from OCC, obviously, just about everything's been inflationary at least in the states in recent months, just along with an improving economy to the extent the economy continues to improve, you know, the freight, labor, chemicals, other stuff. Do you expect those buckets to remain quite inflationary as we've seen them in the recent months? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It's a great question. And when we look at our year-over-year view, you know, we \u2013 we do see inflationary pressure for sure. We see it in energy and chemicals. I think what we're experiencing more than that right now in terms of wood is more seasonal. But you know OCC is \u2013 is the big variable and whether that neutralizes or not, I guess will play out during the year, but certainly, transportation is structural. You know energy and chemicals is \u2013 is material. Wood, we think it stays very competitive. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much, Glenn. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hey, Scott. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Mark or Glenn, when I \u2013 when I look at you know slide 20 on the EBITDA guidance and then you've got the comment around strong and sustainable free cash flow on \u2013 on that slide as well. I'm just trying to triangulate down that the free cash flow. So, get 10% plus EBITDA growth in 2018, do you think you'll be able to get to a 10% plus growth in free cash flow as well or there are some things that hold it back in 2018, relative to 2017? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Good question. And we talked 10% plus, we frame the 10% plus relative to what we said last quarter and what we believe now. We don't forecast cash flow. But I \u2013 but I can say that it \u2013 it should be within \u2013 within the same conditions materially to somewhat equal. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: So, yes to the extent we have upside in EBITDA, most of that will translate into free cash flow. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, fair enough. And then, just as my follow-up question, if I look at the proxy that you filed back on April 5, in regard to compensation, there was a little bit of a change to the long-term management compensation, especially around return on invested capital, I think you move to an absolute ROIC versus a relative ROIC prior, which would seemingly give you a little bit more leeway to change your ROIC targets on a long-term basis. Can you talk about that, and am I reading that correctly? Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: So, what you're, what you're seeing here is, is a change, it was a change under consultation with multiple external advisors including our board advisor. You know, we had an issue with, with relative ROIC in that \u2013 in that plan meeting versus, versus competition, just because of the variability associated with that. While we have built in the ROIC piece of the long-term incentive plan is a structural imperative to have a meaningful spread to our cost of capital, balanced by TSR. So, again, we think a very robust view of growing the size of our intrinsic value with TSR and maintaining over time a ROIC with the spreads of the cost of capital. So, so again, we believe a much more clear and clean way for our organization to see value creation and also to report back out on it. Clearly, the baseline for any payments is our cost of capital, but target is, is a meaningful spread of 200, and again, today we \u2013 we would do any capital allocation with that factor in mind. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Appreciate it. Thanks, Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: So, you've described a couple of your businesses as representing attractive profit pools in this call. Can you expand on what sort of criteria you focus on in determining what constitutes an attractive profit pool. And the second question is fairly simple. Can you tell us more about commercial excellence? My guess is that that's mostly a customer focused program, but I'm wondering, if there are specific financial targets on it as well? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Mark, on a profit pool comment, what we look at and it's part of this framework we described around building attractive positions, building competitive positions and starting attractive markets. One of the attractiveness criteria of the market is that, there's profit to be made and that you can actually see that flow back through the value chain, so that the producer in our case of packaging has a chance to capture some of that profit. There are other markets that have high growth rates, so that's an attractiveness criteria, but based on structure and where they are in the world, there's not much money to be made, and I think if you look at International Paper, you might conclude that our on the ground operations in Asia didn't meet our test for being able to capture a profit pool even though the market has some of the highest growth rates in the world. Instead what we did is we shifted our manufacturing focus and made products that they need in that market and produced them where they should be produced, and hence, we captured the profit pool. For our packaging, when we look at the world, there is more value appreciated by customers, and hence, more ability to create a compelling value proposition and capture profit in the Americas and in Europe. So, that's how we think about that \u2013 that is one of several attractiveness criteria. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And on commercial excellence, are there financial targets there or is that really just making customers happy? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, I think at a high level, it's more than just making customers happy, it's really integrating what we do operationally with what we do commercially. We talk a lot about some of the programs we use to run a good operation in supply chain, in manufacturing; lean manufacturing tools, processes that evaluate data and do predictive analytics on our factories. There's a whole world of similar initiatives around helping customers find solutions to their issues and it might be that our package helps the throughput in a certain customers filling plant, things we've been working on significantly, but when you think about International Paper's journey over the last several years, building the company we have today, a lot of our focus is rightfully been on successfully bringing new people into the company, integrating acquisitions, building a really competitive set of offerings, and focusing on getting our best possible position from a cost and product quality standpoint, and blending the human side of all of that. We've done a very good job of that. And I think it shows in our results with our returns, with our cash flow, with our dividend capability; and we want to re-energize our efforts now on taking the company we build and taking the next step in integrating commercial excellence and operational excellence. So, the targets in there are really reflective in our normal financial targets. We want to produce best-in-class margins and in some cases we already do. We want to increase our distance in our lead. It's also about profitably finding ways to grow the company. We're not a high growth company, but we should not shy away from the ability to grow our company; hence, why we talk about profitable revenue growth. So, if you've got returns like International Paper has, well above our cost of capital and you can profitably grow, you're going to create higher intrinsic value and that should be exciting for investors. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: That's super. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Marcio Farid with UBS Global Research. Marcio Farid - UBS Brasil CCTVM SA : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just one follow-up question on the JV Ilim, I'm not sure how much you can comment on it, but the company has clearly been performed pretty well. So, I just wanted to understand what are the long-term plans there? Do you see room for more investment on capacity growth or the idea is just to pay dividends from here? Thank you. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks for the question. Ilim is a fantastic business, it's one of the best examples we have of our competitive position of serving a really attractive market. A lot of Ilim's products end up going to Asia. There is optimization underway right now in Ilim across the business that gets exported out of the country and across the businesses that served the Russian market. And as Ilim has already in the past disclosed there's opportunity for growing that business through further investment, and that plan is underway in various stages. But business has a tremendous amount of potential, it's performing very, very well. We've got great people in that business and great assets and we have very attractive markets especially the adjacent market in Asia. Marcio Farid - UBS Brasil CCTVM SA : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our final question does come from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Thank you. Just want to make sure I have my numbers are right. It looks like you've cut about $11 million out of the maintenance expense from the year, at least versus the first quarter and with the \u2013 looks like the $14 million extra you spent in the first quarter versus the plan means that we kind of are looking at a nickel of benefit in the back nine months in terms of the maintenance being less than what we would have thought before, you know, based on the first \u2013 the numbers in the first fourth quarter call back in February. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Hey, Chip. This is Glenn. Yeah, I mean, you caught it. Your numbers are directly correct. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Just want to make sure I got that. Thank you. Glenn R. Landau - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: So, thanks, everyone for being \u2013 I'm sorry, operator. Operator : And now, I'd like to turn it back over to Guillermo. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And Guillermo is going to turn it back over to me. Thanks, operator. Thank you for all being on the call and for your interest in International Paper. As I said earlier in my remarks, we have a lot of momentum coming out of the first quarter, and it's driven by solid fundamentals and significant success with our customers and really all of our businesses. We look forward to delivering a very strong year of performance in 2018. We also look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Second Quarter Investor Relations Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you. Mr. Guillermo Gutierrez, you may begin. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2018 conference call. Our key speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered a very strong second quarter performance and year-over-year earnings growth. We had outstanding commercial performance with volume growth and accelerating price realization across our three businesses. Operationally, we performed well in another heavy maintenance outage quarter, and we have now completed 75% of our planned maintenance outages in 2018. Input costs and transportation remain a headwind, which we view largely as a reflection of the healthy underlying global demand environment. The only notable exception is recovered fiber costs, which decreased sequentially and continues to be affected by China policy changes. Overall, we continue to see healthy demand and good fundamentals across our global businesses. Turning to the financial results on slide 4. Revenue increased by more than 8% year-over-year, which again reflects healthy underlying demand, strong commercial performance and a focus on profitable growth. Our North America Industrial Packaging business outperformed industry shipments through the first two quarters of 2018. It's a reflection of really great customers in growing segments. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we delivered record fluff pulp shipments during the quarter. EBITDA improved by 23% year-over-year, driven by margin expansion across all of our businesses, as well as a continued focus on commercial and operational excellence. Many of those initiatives are internal initiatives unique to International Paper. Our equity earnings were $70 million in the quarter, which includes $57 million from our Ilim joint venture and $15 million from our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. We also received a $6 million cash dividend from Graphic Packaging during the second quarter. Our cash from operations in the second quarter improved by about $160 million year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our earnings. Free cash flow for the quarter is essentially flat, and that's just due to the timing of CapEx spending in 2018. Also during the quarter, we purchased $300 million of IP shares. Tim will provide additional details on those purchases as well as our broader capital allocation framework later on the call. I'm excited to be working with Tim in his role as CFO. Many of you know him from his previous roles most recently leading our North American Industrial Packaging business. I'm now going to turn the call over to Tim to cover the performance across our businesses as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Great. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm very happy to be back in the role and able to share our second quarter performance with you. So let me begin on slide 5 of the presentation, which is our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Operating earnings improved $0.25 sequentially, driven by strong commercial performance and price realization across all businesses. Our operations performed well in what was another heavy outage quarter and, as Mark mentioned, we've now completed 75% of our planned maintenance outages in 2018. Input costs were favorable, mostly due to lower recovered fiber prices in the second quarter. Distribution costs continue to trend higher on a very tight truck and rail availability as well as higher diesel fuel costs. We expect the distribution environment to be an ongoing challenge and continue to work aggressively to mitigate its impact. Our corporate expenses and taxes came in largely as expected with a 25% effective tax rate in the quarter. And lastly, equity earnings were lower sequentially due to the non-FX charge on Ilim's U.S.-dollar-denominated net debt, which works out to be about $0.09 deduction to our EPS. All in, a very strong performance across the company. So, on page 6, I'll turn to Industrial Packaging. Industrial Packaging, the team turned in very strong performance in the quarter and delivered quarter EBIT of $569 million with an EBITDA margin of 23% in North America. We continue to see good demand across all channels and realized about 50% of our recent box price increase as we exited the second quarter. We've also completed approximately 75% of planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Operations and costs in the second quarter includes higher LIFO inventory revaluation charges related to the recent price increases. And on input costs, we saw the favorable impact of lower energy and recovered fiber costs, which was partially offset by higher distribution costs across the system. In our European Packaging business, we continue to see compressed margins on our non-integrated business. But having said that, the Madrid mill start-up is in process and we expect to have paper on rail in the coming days. Once up and running, it will materially improve our margins, improve our cost position and our product range. Again, we're very pleased with the business fundamentals and our strong performance in the North American Industrial Packaging business. Turning to Global Cellulose Fiber on slide 7, delivered $69 million of earnings in the second quarter. The two big drivers were the acceleration of price realization and lower planned maintenance outages. On the last point, you may recall that we moved some outages to help meet strong customer demand in the quarter. Global pulp demand is healthy and demand in the fluff segment continues to grow at 4% to 5% annually. During the second quarter, we delivered record fluff pulp shipments, which represent about 75% of our pulp mix. Overall, we're pleased with the progress that the business is making on the commercial side, and the optimization initiatives that they're bringing to the bottom line. Moving to Printing Papers on page 8, we continue to see improved demand globally, and North American mill operating rates have improved significantly since last year. As such, we're realizing price increases across all the regions that we operate in. Volume improved sequentially despite the truckers' strike in Brazil and the lingering effects of the incident at the Kwidzyn mill which returned to normal operations earlier this month. The impact of the truckers' strike of $7 million was offset by favorable FX. Operationally, we did perform well and we've now completed 85% of planned maintenance outages for the year. And although input costs were essentially flat, distribution costs remained elevated, particularly in North America. We're pleased with the improved earnings and the runway in our paper business. As you can see on slide 9, all three businesses continue to show strong year-over-year profitable growth. At a high level, you can see that we came out of a weaker 2016 with consistent revenue growth quarter-over-quarter. In our North American box business, we're ahead of industry volume growth through the first half of this year on what is certainly a tough industry comp. In our business, we are well-positioned in segments that are benefiting from strong secular growth trends. We are also progressing well on our recent box price increase that was announced earlier this year, with 50% realization at the end of the second quarter. And looking forward to the third quarter and year-end, we should be at a 90% realization as we exit the third quarter with full realization by year-end. As I mentioned earlier, the pace of price realization in our Global Cellulose Fibers business accelerated in the second quarter. We're also making good progress with new product introductions in our fluff pulp segment, which is one of the reasons we have expanded fluff pulp to about 75% of overall pulp mix. In papers, we are seeing improved demand and have value propositions in global brands to capture profitable growth. Turning to slide 10, the Ilim joint venture delivered record operating EBITDA of $307 million in the second quarter and an EBITDA margin of 44% before foreign currency charges. IP's equity earnings were $57 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's after-tax portion was $39 million. Taking a look at our third quarter outlook on slide 11. In the Industrial Packaging business, we expect to see a $50 million benefit from continued realization of our recent price increases, mostly in North America. Mix is expected to be a $10 million headwind mainly due to geographic mix. Also note that North American has one less shipping day in the third quarter. We also expect $5 million of incremental expenses related to the Madrid mill start-up during the quarter. The mill is in the start-up process as we speak and we expect to ramp up to 1,000 metric tons per day by the end of the year and to run at full capacity of 400,000 metric tons within one year from start-up. Staying with Industrial Packaging, outage expenses will be $55 million lower, while input costs are expected to increase by about $25 million. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we expect to see a $15 million benefit from our recent price increases and improved mix. Volume is expected to increase seasonally with a benefit of $10 million, as we continue to run our system full to meet customer demand, and outage expense will be $14 million lower. In our global Printing Papers business, we expect to see a $20 million benefit from our recent price increases and mix. Volume is expected to improve sequentially on stronger seasonal demand in Brazil with an expected benefit of $10 million. Also within Printing Papers, operations are expected to improve $15 million, partly offset by higher input costs of $10 million, mostly related to wood in Brazil, Europe and Russia, and outage expenses will be $43 million lower. Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and investment in Graphic Packaging. And lastly, in Other items, we include corporate and interest expense and our estimated effective tax rate for the third quarter. Looking at slide 12, I want to take a moment to share with you our capital allocation framework and more specifics on how we will maximize value creation with our strong and sustainable cash from operations. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, which we view as foundational to the strength of International Paper and provides us with the financial flexibility to maximize value creation. Specifically, we will target debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis. With regard to our pension plan, we feel very good about where we are today with no funding requirements on the horizon. Going forward, we will continue to assess if there are attractive opportunities to further de-risk the plan on a structural basis. We will invest to create value. Our investments will be selective and disciplined, and they will be grounded on clear strategic and financial logic. We will start with a commitment to maintain our safe and sustainable world-class operations with low-cost advantaged assets. We will also invest in cost reduction projects with high returns and quick paybacks, and in strategic projects, with a meaningful spread above cost of capital in our core businesses, Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, all of which further enables us to grow our free cash flow. M&A will be disciplined, selective, and compelling. It must align with our strategy of advantaged positions and attractive markets, and create compelling value for our shareholders with clear financial targets. EPS and free cash flow accretion within the first two years and returns above cost of capital within the first three years. We will return cash to our shareholders through a sustainable dividend and systematic share repurchases. Our dividend policy is clear. We're committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. We will also make share repurchases with a minimum threshold to offset dilution from our compensation plans. And we will continue to evaluate our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that additional share repurchase opportunities are weighed against other capital allocation options with a commitment to maximize value creation. As Mark alluded at the opening, we did repurchase $300 million of shares at an average price of $57.32, and we have $600 million remaining on the current authorization. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Tim. We're very pleased with our strong performance in the quarter. It's our best second quarter in more than a decade. But more importantly, we're pleased with the momentum we carry going into the second half of the year. We continue to see profitable growth across our three businesses with a healthy demand backdrop and high mill operating rates. We're monitoring the tariff situation carefully and, although we do not see any near-term impact to our business, it's certainly difficult to predict the timing and potential impact of evolving trade policies, but we're watching it very closely and are involved in the public policy debate. Our team is focused on delivering on our earnings commitments, and that starts with commercial and operational excellence. We believe taking care of our customers and running safe, efficient operations creates sustainable value. We also have internal catalysts to further accelerate our performance, such as the Madrid mill, which fundamentally changes our business model in Europe, as we move from practically 0% integration to about 60% integration on recycled containerboard. And in Global Cellulose Fibers, the team continues to optimize the business and is bringing innovative solutions to our customers as we grow together in the absorbent pulp market. Looking ahead, we are confident in our commitment to deliver a second consecutive year of more than 15% EBITDA growth. With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Sarah, we're ready for questions. Operator : Your first question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color on the capital reallocation strategy. Just wanted to ask Tim if you marked for the pension to kind of current rates. How close to that targeted 2.5 to 2.8 times range you think we are today? And sort of related to that, for the right acquisition, how high do you think you'd be willing to go with that leverage level? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So, currently, we are roughly a little bit below 3 times. So I don't think we're far off. But I don't want to talk about what we might do and when. But the target is to be consistently in a 2 5 to 2.8 times leverage multiple, and it'll be a combination of debt that we pay down and earnings performance. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And, Brian, I could just add on the question about how high. I mean, fundamentally, we will remain an investment-grade company. And so there's a lot of that goes into that statement, but one of the things is managing even in an event of any acquisition; number one, how high; and number two, how fast you get it back to the level that we're targeting. And that's just in our mind not negotiable. We think it's important, as Tim said, the word foundational is what it is for International Paper. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And on the share repo in the quarter, obviously $300 million is the most it's been in a while. Just wondering, philosophically, was that just more of an opportunistic thing in the quarter or, obviously, you want to offset dilution from equity issuance through the year. This seems like it'll pretty much do it. But is the messaging and the communication here that this is going to be more of a consistent ongoing thing, or should we take it as this was kind of it for the year and more of an opportunistic thing too? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, I wouldn't forecast what we might or might not do in the year. The commitment is that we're going to be systematic about share repurchases and, at a minimum, we will repurchase shares on an annual basis to offset the dilution from our compensation plans. So we thought we had an opportunity in the second quarter, we bought some shares. As I laid out, all of these things are related and there's a number of actions that we could take around capital allocation whether it's balance sheet, share repurchases, dividend, is something that we look at annually. So I see them as all related, and we'll be reporting back as we do them after the fact. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. One last one for me, just switching to the base business. With the elevation in U.S. freight rates, it's been pretty well publicized. Just wondering, do exports look more attractive to you these days? Has your kind of thoughts on where you want to be putting your tons between the domestic and the export market changed much because of that? And maybe you can kind of just update us on where that mix stands today. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It really varies by business. So, if you look at Global Cellulose Fiber, it's mostly an export business. Our markets are in other regions of the world as well as North America. For the containerboard business, we look at it as a strategic part of our mix. We obviously value our integrated box channel. And so we make sure that we are managing the customer demand here in North America and as well as balancing that out with exports. But your question around just margin structure of one region versus another, we still see good margin structure here in North America even on a marginal basis with the transportation costs as they are. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Gail? Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : (22:05) year-on-year on adjusted basis. And then it's a bit slower than we've seen. I'm just wondering is there anything you're seeing in the business. Are there any end markets that you stand out? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hey, Gail. Hi, this is Mark. We didn't hear the first part of your question, if you could repeat it. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Just industry box shipments in 2Q were (22:27) which is somewhat slower than what we've seen. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing any end-markets that are slowing down or changing, or just is there any shift on the demand front? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Cut out just a little bit again, Gail, but I think I got the essence of the question. We felt really good about our box demand in the second quarter and it was against I think the toughest comp of the year year-over-year. So, protein produce, e-commerce, those segments continue to perform very well for us and we were really happy with growth both on a large customer level and our local business across the entire quarter. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And during the quarter, Ilim announced that they were looking at a large kraftliner expansion in Russia. You guys are working on a large expansion here. There are other producers that are looking at kraftliner on a level that we haven't seen in probably at least three decades. And I'm just wondering how you see that playing out globally. Do you think the fiber balance is there that we need that much more kraftliner these days? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: A great question, Gail. Specific to International Paper's efforts, on the Ilim side, the way projects work in that part of the world, you've obviously got to announce that you're going to study and look at something so you can get the different government agencies involved. Forestry is managed differently there. Infrastructure in this particular case is in Siberia, and we believe that's an opportunity much like our pulp business to serve an underserved market from a fiber standpoint, that'd be in Asia. But it's just that. It's undertaking a project and a lot of things have to happen for that project to come to fruition. I think that's probably true from some of the other ones I also saw that are not International Paper. And then you take that all the way to something that's certain and sure like our Riverdale conversion. Our view is kraftliner is growing globally because the box market is growing globally. It is the feedstock for all of the fiber uses downstream. And so it's hard to predict what the markets will look like three, four, five, six years from now. But International Paper has first and second quartile high-quality kraftliner. We have the position in the markets that need it and want it and value it. So, for us, it makes sense to continue to be looking at investing in that market over time. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Morning, Guillermo. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Morning. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Morning. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Mark, I wondered if we could just step back and talk a little bit about the kind of the pricing model in Industrial Packaging. In the past, John Faraci, your predecessor, talked about a willingness to maybe rethink that model at a particular point in time. And I just wondered right now, with the market in pretty healthy condition, whether this is a time you might engage customers to kind of rethink this basis on kind of trade paper pricing. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Mark, I'm going to let Tim comment, given his closeness to that particular market in Industrial Packaging. But pricing, as you know, is at the box level very unique to the type of customer and the type of packaging. There's a catalyst in this industry in North America for the input material changing and contracts are designed around that. There's lots of different ways to do it. Customers buy a lot of other inputs that are priced different ways. But, for right now and for the foreseeable future, this mechanism while imperfect, works for the parties in the value chain. And so, that's kind of how we look at it. But the pricing discussion is really a conversation between International Paper and individual customers, to some extent precipitated by some input cost changes. And, Tim, do you want to add to that? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, no, I think you said it well. The only thing that I would add to it is the way \u2013 it's inappropriate to first talk about what model we might move to. But in the various contracts, it doesn't establish price. It establishes the basis for us to have a conversation about how the contract will perform and how price may move or not move over time. So I don't know that I can add much more than what Mark said. It works at the moment. Our customers find value in it and it's been around for a long time. And so what we negotiate on actual price is our conversation to our customers and agreeing on the basis of supply. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Fair enough. But as a follow-on, I just wondered, Tim, can you or Mark talk about the options for fixing that Brazilian packaging business and maybe whether you're interested in expanding packaging kind of across Latin America more broadly? You're in the two biggest markets right now, Mexico and Brazil. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It's been a challenge, Mark. No question about it. And I think that we like our box plant assets there. We're challenged on the mill cost side, but we have a great customer base. We got pulled in the downdraft of the economy, and that hit us harder than we ever expected it would. And we're battling our way back from that. But, yeah, we're happy with the engagement of the team and the things that they're working on. But it is taking more time and it's harder than we thought given some of the economic realities on the ground. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I mean, does that mean you need like to have virgin fiber mill assets there or what does fix this, Tim? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I think we have the ability to continue ramping up our commercial execution. There's huge leverage there in terms of marginal volume that we put through our box plants. And that will go a long way to restoring margins. There are some cost opportunities, but I think we want to be very careful and very selective about how we think about incremental investments there. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I was going to ask a different question to start, but just given the way the stocks in the history have been acting recently. Tim, I know it's ultimately investors' and analysts' jobs to consider valuation, but has the fact that the market's been effectively applying a higher cost of capital on your results, with the stock having come down, change at all the way you think International Paper will think about capital allocation going forward and the returns that you'll require from new investments? Has there been any migration in those views over the last couple of quarters, and why or why not? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hi, George. Yeah. I think it's what I was trying to outline earlier. We're going to be selective. We're going to be disciplined and we're going to invest in things that support improvement in our core businesses. So I would say, no, there has been no change in our thinking, other than to say we are trying to make better and better choices about investment decisions over time. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I guess a related point and then I'll ask one more as my two-part and turn it over. With again the return that's being applied or discount rate applied to your equity value by the market these days and how it's changed apparently over the last few quarters, does that make buyback any more attractive? You're using a more systematic approach. You've talked about taking in the dilution. But does \u2013 equity has it moved up in terms of repurchases, in terms of capital allocation over the last six months and again given the way it's performed, why or why not? That's question one. And question two, just as we think about the heat map table or slide 11, are there any other points that we should consider in terms of sequential EBITDA trends, are we basically looking at or whatever the number works out, so I think about $130 million, $150 million sequential pickup in EBITDA 2Q to 3Q? Thank you, guys. Good luck in the quarter. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I'd just say, and Mark maybe want to comment on it, but I think the businesses are performing very well and we're set up for a strong third quarter and second half. And related to the first question, I don't want to start forecasting what we're going to do at moments in time. I think we're going to take a broad view. We're going to look at our cash availability and then we'll make the best decisions across the whole capital allocation framework that I talked about. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for the thoughts. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Tim, you discussed the leverage target at 2.5 to 2.8 times, and I think that's down, or at least a clarification from the kind of below 3 times level that you pointed to recently. And I'm just wondering, to follow up on George's question, kind of the thought process behind refining that target leverage change. Does it actually represent a shift and is it based on where you think we are in the economic cycle or discussions with investors? Any color you can give there? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Clarity. Mark said it. We're going to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and we think that at those leverage targets it is very supportive of our current rating. No more than that. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just shifting to a kind of bigger picture question. Mark, the Chinese Government has discussed I think banning imports of pretty much all grades of recovered fiber, which seems like it could have pretty profound impacts to global supply chain. I'm just wondering how you think that could impact IP over the mid- to long-term in terms of OCC prices domestically, or opportunities to send pulp or kraftliner into China, or maybe unintended consequences. Whatever thoughts you could share on kind of what this shift could mean. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: That's a great question, Anthony. And obviously, we're spending a lot of time trying to figure out strategically different options if you play these statements out to reality. Bottom line, though, is China's got a dynamic economy. It's going to need fiber in the long-term. And from an International Paper standpoint, given we have a large position in the new fiber, virgin fiber, which then becomes, as you know, recovered fiber around the world, we feel very well positioned to be a major player in that value-added fiber, whether it's in the form of a finished product or semi-finished product like containerboard, or whether it's in a less finished like, for example, our softwood pulp from Ilim. It's hard to see and I don't pretend to know what the Chinese Government is thinking around the puts and takes. If a position like that hurts one industry in China, but it helps another and helps trade balances. There's a lot of that at play. We're going to monitor it very well. But I think the big picture is that the world is going to need more fiber for all of these sustainable fiber-based products over time. There'd be dislocations from time-to-time and where it's generated and where it's used. But I think, from an International Paper business model, we are very well positioned with the world's best fiber to be a major player in providing that fiber need in different stages of the value chain, different levels of product sophistication. We feel good about that and we'll continue to try to monitor it and be ready to take full advantage of the position we can play. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. One question that's really striking me here is you just had a great quarter. You're laying out terrific momentum coming into the third quarter. The stock though is trading off and it's trading near the low of recent ranges. And certainly one of the catalysts this morning probably is the Cascade announcement that they're looking to go forward with that purchase and a potential conversion of a mill in Virginia. I mean, how concerned are you at this juncture about the capacity that has been announced? And as you overlay what you see happening demand-wise and expect to continue to happen demand-wise, how concerned are you? And are there things that you think are in your capabilities that will help you manage the various scenarios that could play out that you could talk to? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Mark, that's a loaded question with a lot of potential directions it can go in. But let me just say the way we look at this. We just had a recent period where a couple of million tons of containerboard, various types of containerboard were going to be added to the U.S. market. And the underlying box demand, the products that worked versus the products that didn't, I think we navigated through that pretty well. This is another potential global sense in the future. We believe fiber-based packaging is growing. We don't know how many of these projects are going to actually come to fruition and what type of end-product quality. We think it starts with our customers that buy the packaging. And so, that's why we spend so much time saying things like commercial excellence. There's a lot behind those two words. And by having the customer relationships and having the best value chain from tree to box and the recycled fiber in between, we believe we'll be well-positioned, better positioned than anyone really to really benefit from that. So I think it's a robust market. It's a resilient market. And I think we have some very recent history that we can look at and draw some parallels to. And we're going to always make the containerboard in our system that we need for the box orders we have. And right now, you've got containerboard systems in the case of International Paper basically running wide open and full, which is actually not sustainable with respect to customer service and the flexibility you need beyond just when you take mills down for maintenance. So, hard to predict the future. Some of this is way out to 2021 and 2022. But we are very confident in our position. We're confident in the role that we're playing and some of the capacity that will come on. And we're very, very confident in our ability to serve customers on the box end, because that's what really matters in all of this is are you a preferred supplier for the actual package. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for all the color. And just kind of as a follow-on, for instance, with the Riverdale project, if the uncoated freesheet market continues to perform quite well as it is now, is that type of where maybe you have flexibility and you do that a little bit slower and you wait for that corrugated box demand growth to absorb the capacity, or are those things that are sort of set and it gets done in the timing that's been laid out? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I'll ask Tim to comment on that, given it's a near-term project and there's some unique product given it's got the white top component. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So the paper margins are important, but we're really looking at what our Industrial Packaging customers are requiring and we're investing in better capability to supply a better product to them through our integrated channel. So this gives us options for a better white top product, more brown containerboard in the geographies where we need it and in the grades and basis weights that we need. So we would see that project continuing on a timeline that we laid out when we announced it targeting mid-2019. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens, Inc. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Morning. You mentioned that you're seeing improved demand in white paper. Obviously, the quarter was off. So can you give us a little bit of a sense of what you're seeing shifting there? And also was there a negative mixed shift in paper? The results were obviously excellent. The costs were fantastic. But I was surprised that the price realization wasn't even a little better. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. So, no, on the demand side, we were hit by two things. We had the operational issues in Europe around Kwidzyn, the fire and then reliability issue that's since been corrected. And then, we had the truckers' strike in Brazil, which obviously impacted supply chains for a period of time. In North America, it's really been the performance of our customers, stronger year-over-year sequential demand of our product from us. So those are the main reasons, Mark. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then just one other question. Can you give us a sense of where your pulp mix can go from here and what the timeline you're expecting? And also what kind of an operating rate you've got in pulp right now? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, we're running the system flat out. In fact, one of the challenges in the quarter was just product availability, given how much demand we have. And so we don't see that really changing as we're in the third quarter and going into the fourth quarter. We're 75% today, and the goal is to keep as much as we can adding to our fluff and specialty pulp mix, which could approach 85% at a point in time. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Mark, there is just one thing on the pulp. We do have a part of our capacity is the NBSK asset in Canada. So there's kind of a base load of non-fluff. It's a very good product. It's high quality and very profitable. The plan would not to be to convert that obviously to fluff. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Sure. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: But I think Tim's comment about probably 85% in the absorbent markets and then some of the specialty markets that are not exactly absorbent end uses would be where we think we can get to. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Fantastic. Thank you. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. So, just to start, I mean obviously great quarter on Industrial Packaging. But, clearly, Brazil and Europe are still challenged. Will Madrid be enough to get you to where you want to be? I mean, the integration level, I think you said would be 60%. But will it get you to cost capital returns or do you need something virgin over there as well? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hi. This is Tim, Steven. We are already integrated on a virgin basis with our operations here in North America. So we think we have that piece covered for our European converting business. Will Madrid take us all the way to cost of capital? It'll get us darn close. So it's a big factor in terms of product availability for the basis weights and grades that are growing the fastest. And so, as Mark referenced earlier, it gets us to 60% integration on recycled. And we think in the range for the integrated business converting and mill gets us mid-teens on EBITDA margins but with a lower capital base. So, should get us pretty close to cost of capital over time. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I think Tim said it right. It's a little bit of a unique business model because, as we've described the channels to market, we make the kraftliner in North America. We ship it, in this case, over the ocean and we convert it in Europe. So you can draw sort of a box around that part of the channel. And then we were buying on the open market all of our recovered fiber, except for a small mill in the Moroccan business. Now, we're going to be 60% integrated. There's still 40% of the recycled paper that we don't make or won't make. But we're a pretty good buyer. And where our geographies are, we should be able to buy that economically. And then there is virgin medium in the European context, the semi chemical medium, which we do not make. But we're a very good customer of the premium suppliers. So, when you put all that together, that channel to market from board to box is going to be cost of capital. It's just not measured the same way as a single geography would be because, as I said, the containerboard that's virgin is actually captured in the North American Industrial Packaging results. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. And then one other question. If in fact China is permanently out of the OCC market and, by extension, re-emerges as a virgin board buyer, which mills in your system are well-suited to serve that market? And I guess that would exclude Ilim, which is obviously close. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Would exclude Ilim? I don't get that point. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Well, I mean, I'm sure you'll say, well, Ilim is adjacent to China, so that's our conduit into China. But if they need board from North America, are any of your mills... Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Actually... Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: strategically (46:18) situated or would you wish you had something on the West Coast? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: We do. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No, we do. We have a mill on the West Cost and it does ship our product to China and other parts of Asia. But we also have Southern mills that are positioned very close to ports and have product capability and they ship as well. And Ilim today has a small amount of capacity around kraftliner board that they do ship into Northern Central China and supply that part of the market. So I think we're well-equipped across a number of geographies for supply to China if we need it. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Well, thank you both. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, just a follow-up on, I think it was Mark Weintraub's question earlier. How do you think about the relationship between the level of North American containerboard industry margins and how much competition they attract? It seems as if margins have reached a level that have clearly attracted a number of companies. And given that, how sustainable do you think the current margins are? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think the \u2013 it's a good business. So there's always going to be interest in a good business. But the absolute containerboard margins aren't really the final equation. The final equation is the box and having the ability to address all of the various needs of the box customers. And so I think there's going to be a pretty resilient value chain for a company like International Paper that makes both steps of the value chain, the containerboard from very competitive softwood fiber, all the way through to the box. And I think that's going to continue to be the hallmark of that business. It's a lot more. And I think, again, I'd just refer us back to just a couple of years ago, there's a lot more than just adding containerboard capacity and having that really work out in a sustainable way as an investment. You've got to see it all the way through to the box customer. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. And just one on the China situation again. I think RISI reported that of the 10 lowest cost mills in the country now, 7 were 100% percent recycled in the second quarter. Obviously, China is not changing its policy or doesn't appear to be doing so, which is why all these Chinese companies are building mills that touch outside of China. I mean, do you have any reason to expect the current state of affairs in terms of virgin versus recycled mills, and which one is cost advantaged versus the other to change anytime soon in the U.S.? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Anytime soon, I think that would depend obviously on primarily the recovered fiber price, and it is a wildcard to figure out exactly where China's end game is on this because that's the big lever. And then the rest of the inputs, energy and primarily natural gas, that would be the other input that you would have to track. And then, at some point, you just look at the fiber balance and I think it's dislocated right now because of China. But if any growth in recovered fiber comes at the expense of virgin fiber, you can quickly do the math. And then you're now creating less generation of recovered fiber for every ton that you theoretically would displace a virgin. So it ends pretty quickly. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, Mark. Hi, Tim. Welcome back to the CFO role. My first question has to do with CapEx. I noticed that it was a bit higher than it was year-to-date last year, of course without the consumer business \u2013 well, that's taken out. But the point being, are you still looking for around $1.5 billion CapEx or have you re-thought that, especially given some of the tax deductibility, and maybe you found some projects that you didn't have otherwise? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No. The plan hasn't changed. It's just the function of timing, Chip. Given outage schedules and project schedules, it just disproportionally fell into the first half of this year. So we're 60%, 60-plus-percent complete on the capital plan for the year. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. Got you. And then, following up on the whole discussion about China, we know last week that their Environmental Ministry is possibly looking to cease all waste paper imports, which would suggest to me they would basically have to re-footprint about 18 million tons, which is like half our industry. That would also seem to suggest that OCC does stay down while board prices, because of the shortage there, stay up. I didn't know if that was any of your thinking when you were thinking of getting much bigger in Europe in a hurry, because it looks like that they're going to benefit for years, while we see how China re-footprints itself. And even leaving that aside, are there other thoughts you might have about how your strategy could change if we do see a scenario where China basically needs to re-footprint a very major amount of containerboard on a global scale? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So I think, Chip, the first part of your question, was that a factor in our interest in building a bigger business in Europe. No, not really. The interest in Europe was we believe it's a good market and we can build a competitive operation by what we were trying to do. And, obviously, the things that affect the price of the raw material like recovered fiber matter. But you have to believe they're going to change structurally over time. And if you just do the mass balance of fiber, it's hard to find scenarios that really structurally change that for a long period of time that you would justify an investment on. As far as what China is trying to do, I think it's very difficult to predict. I mean, it's extremely popular right now for trade positions by countries to take a very extreme position, see what kind of effect you have, and we seem to be doing it in our trade discussions. I think others are taking positions that, to all of us, look illogical on the surface. But there may be an actual end game in mind or a position that's somewhere south of that extreme position that ends up being where they really want to go. And I think we just have to game it out, think it through and be ready for different scenarios, and that's what we're doing. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Got you. And real quickly on fluff pulp. You mentioned the growth rates and how you're up I think you said to about 75% of your mix. Do you see a situation as the market grows where you might need to make a capacity change in the next three years to five years there? Or do you think you can just instead not add any capacity and just transition more of your paper grade into fluff? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. What we're doing, Chip, and what we will do is look at the customers we have, the demand they have, and we're going to work hard whether it's through capacity additions or optimization to make sure that we can supply them product they need. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is actually John Dunigan on for Scott. How are you doing, Mark, Tim, Guillermo? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, John. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Good morning. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Good morning. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, realizing we're a bit late in the call, I'll just keep my questions to one for right now. You held on to the 15%-plus EBITDA growth rate for the year again obviously. But do you believe free cash flow can grow at that same clip or is there anything either positive or negative that couldn't cause free cash flow to dislocate from the EBITDA growth? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think, over time, we should expect to see free cash flow grow as we generate more cash from operations. The comment I made about the quarter was simply, as Tim just reiterated, CapEx timing. But, no, our expectation is to grow free cash flow because we're growing cash from operations. That's not automatically going to result in incremental CapEx. But as part of our capital allocation, we should be able to show the returns for that incremental CapEx that's in cost reduction and in the strategic category of capability and, in some cases, some capacity debottlenecking. But we want to lift the entire cash flow equation from cash from ops as well as free cash. John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for getting me on. Two quick questions, one on paper in Brazil and the other clarifying on guidance. There were just some trade articles about producers in Brazil sending offset to Mexico and avoiding duties. I was just wondering if that has a financial impact on IP or any thoughts on an impact to trade flows going forward. And then I'll move on to guidance aspect. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hi, Debbie. It's Tim. No, we don't see any impact on anything that we have done up to this point. It's hard to speculate on what might happen going forward. But any change that did happen would not be retroactive in any way. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, on guidance, you did note an uptick in paper volumes in Brazil. I think last year they actually went down sequentially. Am I missing something there? And then I don't think I caught your inflation guidance for Industrial Packaging. Not sure if you gave an exact number on that. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Inflation guidance for? Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just in the sequential bridge that you gave. It's kind of an uptick in freight logistics cost. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We didn't break it out, but you can follow up with Guillermo. But, in general, in Industrial Packaging in North America, we have usually between $110 million and $130 million on an annual basis of inflation in the business. And then what \u2013 I'm sorry, I forget the other question that you have. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You just mentioned you put in the guidance that you would expect Brazil that volumes to be higher sequentially I believe and when I look last year, that pattern doesn't hold. So I just wanted to know if there was something there that... Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Okay. No, we do expect them to be up. I don't remember if there was some unique circumstance last year. But from second to third quarter, we expect them to be up slightly. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Guillermo. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Sarah. And thank you again for joining our second quarter earnings call. As always, Michelle and I will be available for your follow-up questions. Let me now turn it back over to Mark for some closing remarks. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Guillermo. Just to wrap up. As you've heard from our remarks, we're very pleased with our second quarter, a very strong performance. International Paper employees executed very well in a very strong economic environment, running our operations close to full. We're very excited about the great outlook that we see for the rest of the year across all of our businesses. I think we're hitting on all cylinders right now and we have a balance of really good commercial performance with our customers and our product offerings, as well as we're running very well. So we appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation to those figures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and the Graphic Packaging investments, slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered very strong performance in the third quarter with more than 50% earnings growth year-over-year and building on our solid performance in the first half of the year. We expect the momentum in our businesses to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019. Coming back to the third quarter, we had solid commercial performance and continued price realization across our three businesses. And, overall, we see continued healthy demand for our products globally. We are facing cost headwinds from distribution and most of our inputs, but again we see this as a reflection of the strong economy that we're operating in and the healthy underlying demand for our products. Our operations performed well in a lighter planned maintenance outage quarter and our teams managed extremely well through Hurricane Florence. Tim will cover the financial impact of Hurricane Florence in more detail. But, first, I want to thank the employees in our company who were impacted by the historic storm for their commitment to prepare, recover and restart our facilities safely and clearly in the face of their own personal hardship. I'm also very proud of the response by the IP family. IP and our Employee Relief Fund provided $1.8 million in emergency funds at the time it was needed to more than 1,200 employees to assist them with the basic needs in the aftermath of the storm. I think this is a great example of what we call The o \u2013 doing the right things and the right ways for the right reasons all of the time. Turning to the financial results on slide 4, revenue increased by more than 7% year-over-year on solid commercial performance and continued healthy demand. EBITDA improved by nearly 18% year-over-year with very strong margin expansion across our three businesses. Our North American Industrial Packaging business performed very well. We are ahead of the industry volume growth in the third quarter, driven by our focus on segments that are benefiting from strong secular growth trend Our Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered record fluff pulp shipments in the third quarter despite the impact of Hurricane Florence, and our Papers business delivered very strong results globally with outstanding commercial and operational performance. Our equity earnings in the quarter were $92 million dollars, which includes $74 million from our Ilim joint venture and $19 million from our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging. Free cash flow accelerated in the third quarter on very strong cash from operations and lower CapEx versus the second quarter as we expected. All in, the company delivered a very strong performance and we managed it extremely well through the hurricane. I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our three businesses as well as our fourth quarter outlook. Tim? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. I'm on slide 5 which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Operating earnings improved $0.37 sequentially, driven by strong commercial performance and lower planned maintenance outage expense. Third quarter results were negatively impacted by $36 million related to Hurricane Florence. During the quarter, we also had a favorable one-time true-up of $24 million across all businesses that will not repeat in the fourth quarter. This was mainly related to lower health and medical benefit cost. And in operations and cost, we also had higher expenses related to the Madrid mill start-up. Input costs and distribution were unfavorable, with higher costs sequentially across most inputs. The distribution environment remains very tight and our businesses continue to work aggressively to mitigate the impact. Corporate expense and taxes were favorable with a 24% effective tax rate driven by discrete tax benefits in the quarter. Lastly, equity earnings were higher sequentially despite a non-cash FX charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated debt which works out to be about a $0.06 deduction to our EPS. As Mark said, it was a very strong performance for the company. Turning to slide 6, I'll provide more details on the financial impact of Hurricane Florence. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $36 million impact in the third quarter, which includes $8 million in volume and $28 million in operations. Looking ahead, we expect a $15 million impact in the fourth quarter, mostly in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. With regard to insurance recovery, we're currently working with our providers to determine the potential recovery, but do not expect any material proceeds in the fourth quarter. I'd also point out that the hurricane is deemed as a single event, so our deductible will be $20 million across the enterprise. So, I'll start with the segments on slide 7, first with our North American or Industrial Packaging business, and in North America, the business performed very well delivering $622 million in earnings and a 24% EBITDA margin. By the end of the quarter, we had realized 90% of our recent box price increase. And overall, we continue to see healthy demand across all channels. I'll have more on that in just a minute. Input and distribution costs were a headwind in the third quarter across most inputs, including recovered fiber which increased by $14 million sequentially. Performance in our European Packaging business was impacted by start-up and commissioning cost as well as the overhead burden of a mill that was not at a full ramp. All in, that was a $25 million dollar impact in the quarter. Additionally, box demand was seasonally lower and we experienced especially weak fruit and vegetable demand due to adverse weather conditions. A brief update on the Madrid mill. The mill started up in the quarter. We're making progress as we go through the checkout and test phase and we'll continue to ramp up operations and production as the quarter progresses. Overall, we're confident of the business fundamentals and very pleased with the strong performance in North America and momentum in the fourth quarter. In Europe, we anticipate seasonally stronger demand and we'll start capturing integrated margins on recycled containerboard as the Madrid mill ramps up. Coming back to the North American Packaging business on slide 8. An important contributor to our strong performance is our deliberate focus to serve the fastest-growing segments and be aligned with the best customers across all segments. While our scale and footprint enables us to serve just about every corrugated segment, we are leading the way in e-commerce, fresh produce and protein. Across the business, we have segment-specific innovation teams who work with our customers to develop value-creating packaging solutions. This is ultimately how value is created from fiber to the consumer, and it is a driver of why our box shipments are outperforming the industry as reflected by our third quarter box shipments, which were up 1.5% year over year on a blended basis. On slide 9, the Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered earnings of $85 million and 21% EBITDA margins in the third quarter, driven by strong commercial performance and price realization across our portfolio. As I mentioned before, Hurricane Florence impacted results in the business by $28 million, which includes a $7 million impact to volume. Even with the hurricane, the business had record fluff pulp shipments of 8% growth year-over-year in the third quarter. Our strong growth is driven by understanding and addressing our customers' needs. We have a unique and powerful innovation engine and an unmatched service model with global reach and local execution. And our multi-mill system allows us to deliver the value to customers in the fast-growing, absorbent markets around the world. Part of that mill system advantage goes back to the conversion we undertook at Riegelwood in mid-2016. For us, it was the right decision at that time and has enabled us to support the strong growth we see today. We've delivered more than 450,000 tons of fluff pulp through our customers from Riegelwood which is right in-line with expectations. Moving to Printing Papers on page 10. The business delivered outstanding results globally on strong commercial and operating performance as well as lower planned maintenance outage expense. EBITDA margins were 23% across the segment with all the regions contributing to a strong quarter. Input costs were a headwind in the quarter and year-over-year, driven by higher wood, energy and chemicals. And in North America, distribution costs remain a challenge. Overall, an extremely good quarter across all geographies. On slide 11, the Ilim joint venture continues to deliver solid financial performance with operating EBITDA of $297 million and an EBITDA margin of 45% in the third quarter. That's before foreign exchange charges. Volume was down sequentially due to heavy planned maintenance outages in the quarter. IP's equity earnings were $74 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt, of which IP's after-tax portion was $23 million. Taking a look at year-to-date performance, operating EBITDA through the third quarter is $898 million dollars, almost double last year at this time. So, turning to the outlook on slide 12. In our Industrial Packaging business, we expect to see the last part of the recent price increase in North America. Volume is expected to be a $10 million benefit from stronger seasonal demand in North America and Europe. Operations are expected to be flat sequentially as improved mill operations and lower Madrid mill expenses are offset by the non-repeat of the third quarter true-up I mentioned earlier. Staying with Industrial Packaging, outage expense will be $57 million lower and input costs are expected to be stable. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, additional price realization will be largely offset by geographic and product mix in the fourth quarter. Volume is expected to be a $5 million benefit and operations are expected to improve by $5 million. Outage expense will be $3 million higher in the quarter. In our Printing Papers business, we expect to see a $10 million benefit from our recent price increases and improved mix. Volume is also expected to improve sequentially on stronger seasonal demand in Latin America and Europe, with an expected benefit of $10 million. Operations are expected to be a $15 million headwind in the quarter. This includes approximately $10 million of currency headwinds in Brazil. Outage expense will be $3 million higher and input costs will be a $10 million headwind, largely due to higher wood cost in Brazil and Russia. Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and investment in Graphic Packaging. And in other items, we include corporate and interest expense and our estimated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. On slide 13, turning to capital allocation. Last quarter, I shared with you our capital allocation framework and more specifics on how we will maximize value creation. I want to take a moment to update you on the recent actions and provide additional clarity on what you can expect from International Paper. So, let's start with the balance sheet. In the quarter, we took a couple of actions to derisk our pension plan and further reduce our exposure to our pension liability. First, we executed a pension liability transfer of $1.6 billion, which was funded entirely with planned assets. We also, based on improved funding levels that we saw as we were exiting the quarter, we decided to adopt a more conservative approach on asset allocation, increasing our fixed income investments and reducing our allocation to equities. The key takeaway here is that we see no funding requirements on the horizon. As I said last quarter, we will maintain a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis. We are currently at about 2.9, so improving our leverage ratio is a priority. Turning to cash back to shareholders, returning cash is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework and it will be as we go forward. Earlier this month, we increased our dividend by 5.3% to $2 annually. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase since 2011 and reinforces our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% or 50% of free cash flow. Also earlier this month, our board of directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. This is incremental to the $400 million remaining from a previous authorization at the end of the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases. Going forward, you can expect our share repurchases to be thoughtful and have a consistent cadence based on value. Turning to investments and as we committed last quarter, M&A will be disciplined, selective and compelling. And we will invest to create through organic projects that are grounded on clear, strategic and financial logic. Currently, for 2018, we are expecting that our spending on capital will be approximately $1.6 billion due to the timing of spend on very attractive strategic projects. And staying on the topic of capital allocation, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Thanks, Tim. And on a related topic, I'd like to cover in this section of our call I want to share with you an update on our portfolio. After careful consideration, we have decided to explore strategic options for our Brazil Packaging business, including the possible sale of the business. Essentially, we have concluded that we cannot competitively serve the Brazil Packaging segment with the structure of our existing business. We plan to provide appropriate updates as we go forward. And coming back to Tim's remarks on capital allocation, to me, it's all about value creation. That's what drives our decisions. Our approach to capital allocation reflects our confidence in International Paper's strong free cash flow generation and our long-term outlook. Turning now to slide 14, I want to take this opportunity to share my views on International Paper and our performance. We delivered a very good third quarter and are well-positioned for a strong fourth quarter with momentum as we move into 2019. We see continued healthy demand globally for our products, but that's not the whole story. The way I see it, it all starts with our customers and our focus on commercial excellence. There's a lot behind those words. It's all about making sure we have the customer relationships and the best value chain to solve their needs \u2013 from fiber to box, from fiber to fluff pulp, and from fiber to paper. It's about International Paper's unique capabilities to solve our customers' unique needs. And speaking to packaging specifically, we're very confident in our ability to provide our customers with the best packaging solutions, because ultimately that's what matters \u2013 to be the preferred partner, to develop and supply the actual package. Across all of our businesses, we have unique capabilities to thrive through just about any challenge we may face. We have the people, the innovation, the products and a low-cost, high-quality manufacturing system to succeed with our customers. And with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is going to come from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions for me. First of all, it's good to know you still have about 10% of the containerboard price hike yet to be realized. And I'm just wondering, is it your client mix that is maybe a little slower in implementation than the competition? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Tim. It's all based on contracts and the negotiation around those contracts as we go through the implementation. So, for us, it's kind of a normal type of implementation across the mix of business that we have. And if you remember going back to the second quarter, we actually were able to accelerate part of that realization at the end of the second quarter and then I think the third quarter followed right as we would have expected it to. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for that, Tim. And then also on containerboard but this time in Europe, the operating profit is a little bit disappointing. And I know that part of that is due to the Madrid start-up and that will be ultimately part of the solution. But is the margin differential between Europe and North America also somewhat attributable to like your transfer pricing of the board that you shipped from North America across the pond? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: I'll take the transfer pricing question. Mark probably wants to comment on the margins in Europe. We transfer at markets, so we are in the open market. We are shipping board to our integrated business. And everything we do, whether it's here in North America or other parts of the world, we're always attempting to be right on top of a market price as we think about how we sell to our integrated businesses. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: And Steve, this is Mark. On the plan we have for Europe, we see the combination of the competitive Southern European focused box business with the integration of our high-performance Madrid mill and the integration of the U.S. kraftliner into our Kraftliner segment. As Tim said, the profit for that shows up in the U.S. business. We see our business being able to get to competitive European EBITDA margins. Now, remember, there's always going to be a gap in EBITDA margins. In a North American context, you got a lot more capital employed with virgin mills than you do in Europe. So, working toward a cost of capital return, you get there with lower EBITDA margins in Europe than you would in a higher CapEx environment that you have in North America. But in North America, you generate your own energy, you have a different cost structure, so you trade capital for operating cost, and the goal is to create value by getting well above our cost of capital in both business models. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: That's good color. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark, I'm just \u2013 my first question on your demand; Europe, a healthy 1.5% in the quarter. Did you see anything \u2013 have you seen anything much different in October and were you at all surprised by the slowdown in the rate of industry growth as the quarter progressed? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. In our quarter \u2013 hey, Adam. It's Tim. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: In our quarter, we felt very good about; it was very strong and we see it continuing into October into the fourth quarter. So, we only know what we see in terms of the segments that we're exposed to and the customer mix that we have. And as I've pointed out in the comments, we think we have the best customers across all of our segments but especially within these faster-growing segments very well-positioned. So, right now as we're in October, it feels like our third quarter momentum has continued. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. And Mark, just one question on vertical integration. I think you addressed this on the last call because there was a capacity addition announced on the day of your 2Q call and the question of vertical integration came up. The open market is supposed to be pretty small. But obviously, we've seen four capacity announcements in recent months from nonintegrated producers and the obvious question is where is all that paper going to go? What are your thoughts about that issue and why the limited open market has not prevented this number of capacity announcements of late, appreciating that we don't know for sure that they'll all come on but assuming they will. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: It's a great question, Adam, and I think your last qualification is a valid one. We don't really know how all of the capacity will play out. But as I said in my remarks, what really matters is the actual packaging solution, the box and the supply chain services you provide for customers. So being an open market provider of one or two grades of containerboard, you might find a place in that value chain and you might not. And I think the last time, in the 2015-2016 period where some capacity was added by different types of industry participants including nonintegrated, we saw a wide range of outcomes, from complete failure to being acquired by a vertically-integrated company and everything in between. And I think we're probably going to see some of that here as well. The way I look at it though, Adam, the big picture is containerboard globally is growing. And the virgin containerboard that's made competitively in the U.S. primarily is going to feed a lot of the fiber need. There are some dislocations right now, but I think we're going to see that mass balance of fiber to where packaging is made settle out over time because the corrugated box is a really good packaging solution for so many different segments, so I think that's what's going to happen. I said that and others said that in our company when we met with investors a few years ago, it sort of turned out that way. So, I guess we will have to see how things transpire over the next couple of years but I feel really confident about the supply chain, the value of integration because it's what addresses the customers' need. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, congratulations on a strong quarter. Question on inventories and where you sit today and we've heard a lot about increased distribution costs and such, and it doesn't look like that's going away anytime soon. Just how you feel about inventories in your system and highoperating rates as we look at industry data, how that might persist through the fourth quarter? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Gabe, it's Tim. We feel better about our inventory levels now than we have in a long time just based on a string of events, whether it was natural disasters or specific issues that impacted our mills. We spent most of last year and much of this year really working our supply chain hard to get back to more sustainable levels of inventory at a time when you had all of the transportation issues \u2013 first, rail; and then truck and so it's been timing to get product where it needs to go, but it's also been sourcing the right kind of transportation at the right time. So, I would say, across our channels, we've been chasing to catch up on orders especially in the export markets and also working hard to get back to a sustainable footing on inventory levels and I feel like we're just now beginning to get there. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, Mark and Tim. If you could just clarify the year for the CapEx number, the $1.6 billion, and then my main question is the \u2013 if you look at industry data, obviously, we've seen a surge of export activity in the last quarter. I think September was the highest for any quarter or any month on record. And I just wanted \u2013 it would be one thing if we were seeing a soft economy and you guys weren't running your mills to the max. But looking at the operating rates, it would seem to suggest that there was actually a desire to get board out there, and I just didn't know if you could help us understand what's causing the export market to be so attractive to make such a stretch to supply it? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, I think you've seen -good morning, Chip, it's Tim again. I think you've seen the price realizations over a period of time. The demand has been and continues to be very strong across all of the geographies that we serve and we've always thought of export as something as a strategic channel to market for us especially with a core group of customers. Part of what we've been doing, as I referenced in the response to the last question, is just catching up on orders as backlogs had extended out in time. So we saw healthy demand in the quarter. We continue to see healthy demand. I think that continues as we exit 2018 and go into next year. And it's been that way for several years in a row now, so this is not something that's new. The demand has been there consistently. On the capital spending, it's really timing. We're a little bit lower last year than what we had guided to and part of that has spilled over into this year and so we're thinking that it's right around $1.6 billion in 2018 after being $1.4 billion last year. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, this is my follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about maybe what CapEx will be next year? And in the context of that, if you think about it, the after-tax dividend yield, at least last night, was over 5%. And I know your after-tax borrowing costs are well below that. So, just any thoughts about how that impacts what you were saying about buybacks? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I think \u2013 I don't want to try to forecast for people about what we will do. I think we've laid the framework out and we see the same numbers that you see. And so I think the approach that we're taking is we're reporting after the fact what we've done in the quarter and let those actions speak for themselves over time. And the other part of your question about 2019, we're still working through the numbers. It will be lower but we don't have a number that has been finalized at this point. We normally put that out at the end of the fourth quarter when we release in January. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. So, despite the Riverdale project, it will be lower. Thanks. That's very helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody, thanks for taking the question and for the details. I want to take two questions \u2013 one from a packaging standpoint then I want to drill back into dividends and cash flow in a minute. Obviously, you showed better-than-industry growth this quarter and I guess that'd be one way to measure it but could you provide some sort of quantification or a qualitative view on how you're trying to distance your packaging business versus others? And the reason I asked \u2013 I mean to the earlier question about paper capacity coming in and the merchant channel being constrained because of all the buyouts that have occurred? In theory, somebody could also start opening up box plants and then you'd have more independent capacity available as well, so how do you quantify or how do you create a moat around your box business and grow that share versus peers from a performance standpoint? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, this is Mark, good morning. That's a great question and it's sort of embedded in those words we used in our prepared remarks. But when you think about all the different types of segments that go into the corrugated packaging market and what different customers need, we have the ability, starting with the base material of containerboard, to design the exact right package uniquely for that customer's need. And, in some cases, that's combining three or four different types of grades into a final package. And we control the making of those grades and the quality that goes into that. You can trade off specs on the inside of the box versus the outside. And all of those types of things are what we bring to the customer. In other cases, customers want additional services beyond just the physical package. They want supply chain services, maybe some fulfillment services. In some cases, our smaller customers want help inside of their plants with health and safety and reliability. So when we go to market, we study every customer \u2013 what we can offer, what their needs are and we look for where there's a match and where there's an unserved need, and then we go out and we prepare something that really is compelling for our customers. So when Tim talked about the high-growth segments and the customers within those segments, there is a lot of analytical work that goes on in that process of us targeting the segments that we believe will be here in the future and the customers within those segments. And so it's not just the physical box. It's a lot of what we call value-added services for our customers that we hope make our relationship with those customers pretty sticky. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that Mark. And as an aside, I mean do you feel you still have more opportunity to get paid for the additional service components or you feel like you're getting fair value for that? And then, my other question to the dividend and recognizing your commentary today suggest you're comfortable in your outlook and the momentum into 2019 and, yeah, the stock is up today. But when the stock is at $40 a share, the dividend yield is 5% and that is typically a level where people are really beginning to worry about the macro outlook going forward. Not that you're preparing for this but could you remind us how quickly and, to what degree, could you reduce CapEx if you needed to if there was something on the horizon that we're not all seeing yet and why and what issues you may have in securing the dividend through the cycle? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Thanks, George, this is Tim. Just on the capital, I mean go back and look at what we've done in prior periods. All the years are different. Circumstances are different. But I think we've demonstrated, over time, a level of flexibility where we can manage capital in the moment if we absolutely have to. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: George, I would add on that though. The context to your question is about how do you operate, what's your flexibility in a differing economic environment, a downturn or something like that. It's more than just capital though. We've got a cost structure that has a high component of variable cost that we can adjust based on demand, and you've seen us do that in the past. And we've worked very hard to make our marginal economics model for how we buy every input and how we schedule machines and what we make. And when we make less... George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: ...the majority of our costs are variable. They go away. And so, we've got the ability to manage our cash flow which is what I meant when I said we are well-positioned to deal and thrive through almost any set of conditions that are out there, especially on a relative basis. And part of that is just the scale of the company and the ability for us to be able to make decisions in high-demand periods, in medium-demand periods, and in low-demand periods. So, we feel good about that flexibility beyond just the ability to temporarily cut capital. It's much more than that. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate the context. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, two questions. One, I jumped in late, so I wasn't sure if you mentioned October volumes to-date. And then if you could just comment on any the kind of regional differences that you're seeing East or West Coast related to Ag or whatnot? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. Hey, Debbie, it's Tim. Yeah, we did cover it a little \u2013 a few minutes ago. But the synopsis was that we had a strong quarter in the third quarter. We've actually outperformed market all year long based on a lot of the factors that we talked about in the commentary, and we see that momentum continuing in October as we've gone through the month. So, I think you could look at third quarter and see the similar type of result so far. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, sorry about the repeat. But my second... Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No problem. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ... question, you have touched on this as well, but just kind of broadly speaking, I actually think it \u2013 it's actually not that surprising that you're seeing a lot of international players looking to build capacity in North America just given the increasing environmental restraints, higher cost of production that you're seeing with wage increases and things like that. And I'm just wondering if you think about getting more involved in kind of taking control of the supply that's going offshore, what you would need to feel more comfortable about that, because I think a lot of the concern for investors is just who's adding the capacity and kind of not really understanding what they might do with it. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Debbie, that's a great question. I think there's all types of companies that have announced intentions to make some containerboard. I think the fundamental issue that I always come back to and we come back to in International Paper is that the global fiber trade is a global business. And virgin fiber primarily \u2013 but not only \u2013 but primarily out of the U.S., some in Latin America and some in, let's say, Russia and Northern Europe, is the feedstock for the global packaging business. The markets are growing more in parts of the world that use recycled fiber as we all know. Recycled fiber, depending on where it comes from originally, was new fiber to begin with. So it's not two separate universes. And so it would be expected as the global packaging market grows, to see possibly more fiber being generated out of the competitive markets. So if OCC was working before but now it's not because of environmental concerns, then taking that fiber one step earlier in the process, cleaning it up and making it recycled pulp or something, and then feeding the box market is another business model. Is it cost competitive? I think that's the way markets are designed. We'll have to see. But if there's no other option because of environmental concerns then it becomes the standard. So it's about moving fiber to the places where packaging demand is growing. And I think that's what we're seeing playing out and we're a major participant in that. We've generated very strong margins many times, best-in-class margins as a longtime participant in these global fiber markets when, in some cases, they're not quite as attractive as our domestic box business, but over time, you can see that we've built this channel strategy that's developed into a very strong global competitor. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you for that. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I've got a couple of questions. First, I understand that Amazon is starting to make some changes in the requirements for packaging from some of their customers beginning in 2019. I think this is more on some of the heavier weight products that they move. Could you just talk about that and talk about the implications for IP? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I don't think we want to talk about customer-specific items, Mark, to be honest. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, it sounds like this affects like maybe 1,000 vendors in the Amazon and sort of what they're going to have to provide in terms of packaging. So I think just as \u2013 for the market as a whole, it's a fairly large potential issue. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. And we work closely with all of our customers. And I just \u2013 I think on principle, it's better if they speak for themselves and we don't try to. So we're very close with a lot of our customers, all of our customers in e-commerce. We understand the trends. We're working closely with them. I think the key there is that because we are viewed as a leader in the space, they seek our involvement and input. And so we feel like we are on the front-end of a lot of the innovations and changes that come about and I would just leave it at that. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And Mark, just coming back to kind of Debbie's question, I'm just kind of curious. If you think about the cost of making paperboard packaging; next to fiber, energy is usually the second biggest variable cost, so I'm just trying to understand longer-term how you think it makes sense or if you think it makes sense, to basically be passing fiber for recycled packaging through two energy cycles? You got to produce the recycled fiber here in the U.S. and dry it. And then presumably, you're sending it offshore to be rewetted and turned into paperboard and then going through a second energy cycle. It just \u2013 it kind of puzzles me how long-term that makes good economic sense? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: I think it's a great observation, Mark, and it wouldn't seem to make great economic sense, but you always have to measure that value chain against the alternative. And if you have non-tariff and tariff barriers, so other costs that are not operating costs, that raise the cost of your alternatives, one being OCC, one being tariffs on finished products, then the economics change. Is it long-term sustainable? Maybe not, but you've got a burgeoning packaging market in a part of the world that's struggling to get fiber, so in order to survive and provide products for customers, you may do something that raises your costs for a while. And I just think if you look at what makes it economically viable, it's what are your alternatives and right now there are limited alternatives for moving fiber without that extra step of cleaning basically. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Just to kind of complete this thing, would you worry if you were in that kind of situation about just another change in government policy? Because it seems like this whole thing is really swinging around pretty widely on sort of government policy in Washington and government policy in China? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Would I worry? Absolutely. I think you have to stay heavily engaged in government policy. So, when you look at the type of investments being made in odd wood baskets and those kinds of things, I think is reflective of some uncertainty about, well, how long will I need this investment, is it going to be permanent, is it going to be for a while? I think we've got to see all of that play out, but back to what I said at the beginning, this fiber has to move to where the packaging has to be made for customers and it will. It will find a way to move and the economics are going to be driven by the absolute cost of manufacturing and the nonmanufacturing cost of government policy. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks, Mark. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question would come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Regarding the Brazil Packaging decision, I'm wondering if there's a timeline for when that divestiture could be executed? Is there any read to your freesheet business in Brazil which, I guess, has historically been very profitable? And then understanding that the packaging business has kind of underperformed since you acquired it, what sort of ultimately drove the decision that it might be better off with a different owner? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Anthony, good morning. I think that there's no specific timeline because we're just starting the process but we will provide updates as we have relevant information. We're going to look at several options. There's some creative options with that kind of business in that type of market, but we will move at a deliberate pace and there's no read-through on the paper business. The paper business is structured entirely differently in our IP, whereas we talk about trying to build an advantaged position, which has multiple dimensions. We have that in our Brazil paper business with our own land and eucalyptus fiber, but also the cost structure and the ability to export probably the highest quality, uncoated freesheet business product all over the world. The issue with the packaging business is it's a domestic business and it depends on GDP growth. And unfortunately for us, we bought the business that we knew was going to need some additional work but we bought it in the face of a deep, deep recession that I don't think anyone really anticipated. So with negative growth to basically zero growth, we just haven't seen the growth we needed to get the momentum to be able to be competitive in that business. The box plant part of the business is very good. Our mill system needs work and we've chosen to deploy our cash in other places that have a much higher return versus in that Brazilian mill system. And had we had 4% growth \u2013 3%, 4% growth, we might be in a different spot. But we've had now three, almost four years of a contracted economy which has greatly affected the box businesses. The business models that have worked in that part of the world are really similar to the business model we had here, which is an integrated business model for the local market and a very competitive export product for the rest of the world. We don't need that. We have all the export capacity we need out of the best place to make it, which is the U.S., so we're not trying to replicate that business model. And that's what led us to the decision, is that we have better uses for the cash and the depth of the recession in the local economy has just been more persistent than we had anticipated. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just following up on Mark's question, you sell pulp into China. You have a lot of global consumer and industrial customers. I'm just wondering what impact you're seeing from these U.S. China tariffs? It seems like, year-to-date, the impact has been limited but at least from some of the recent calls, it also seems like something that more companies are flagging and increasingly concerned about. I'm just wondering what you're seeing for IP and hearing from your customers? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: It has been limited. We keep a very close eye on it. We're working our own channels of policy lobbying. The issue for us is that the type of products we sell, whether it's through our Global Cellulose Fibers business or even our Ilim joint venture, our products that the market really needs and it's even with a potential tariff is still the best option for the local producers. So, unlike some of the people who have been flagging their supply chain with mechanical parts and other things that have reasonable alternatives with just a little bit of work, this is a natural resource business that the alternatives are known and we have real competitive positions for the type of products like the absorbent pulp or the softwood tissue and fiber that we sell out of our joint venture with Ilim, that really is the best solution for those markets. So we are watching it very closely but that's really the reason for the limited impact. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask on the Printing Papers business. I thought they were great results in the quarter and I think relative to your sort of guidance you laid out, they were also quite a bit better. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what drove the upside to your expectations there and how much of that you view as sustainable versus anything that might be a little bit more transitory? And then just sort of tied to that, any concern that the stronger dollar might encourage some more imports like we have seen in the past. And just a last kind of tying it into the Papers business, last question, any thoughts on the timing of the conversion to white top kraftliner, any thoughts on \u2013 given the current economics, delaying that or pushing that out a little bit into the future? Thanks. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hey, Brian, it's Tim. Yeah, I think you highlighted a great story in the quarter. Printing Papers, across all of our regions performed very well, and it's just like we've said, it was across most facets of the business. Brazil had an exceptional quarter but even in North America and Europe, solid commercial and operational results. And I think that one of the aspects that's consistent across the regions is the ability for all of the businesses to sell more product closer to home where they can secure better margins. In terms of Riverdale, we're still working through all of our detailed engineering and making progress. There is no update that we have in terms of timing but we're looking at how we do it optimally for our businesses involved \u2013 both white paper business and the Industrial Packaging business, so no change, no update at this time but we continue to work through all of our analysis. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then, just any color on imports you might \u2013 any change in what you're seeing there? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We haven't seen anything so far, so hard to predict the future. But yeah, it's \u2013 we've had better opportunity, as I said, to sell more product closer to home and all of the regions. That includes North America, so we'll have to see how it plays out based on currency and other factors over the next few quarters. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And just sticking on the topic of imports and exports, and shifting over maybe a little bit more towards the containerboard business, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any more competition in some of these export markets from other players, either existing guys or folks who are seeing a little bit more weakness in their domestic market and looking to move some stuff offshore. And tied to that, is the 4Q outlook that you laid out, does that include some slippage in export prices that were sort of picking up related to the tariffs and the currency shifts that we're seeing? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. I mean I wouldn't comment on price going forward. I think we laid out our expectations on the outlook, which would include also the export market. But we \u2013 I mean, we've continued to see extremely strong demand across regions. I think in a seasonally low period, it's normal to see some spot business that pops up in different parts of the world. That's the way I would characterize it and we'll see what happens as the season starts picking up now that we're in the fourth quarter in different regions of the world. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Thank you. I wanted to just revisit a little bit some of the comments you made on pension. Obviously, there's been a huge use of cash, the contributions during the last 10 to 15 years, and it sounded like you are \u2013 of the view, there's going to be little or no contributions at least for the foreseeable future. I wanted just to understand your confidence level in that and how much you are systematically protected at this stage versus if interest rates move one way or another, the situation changes. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It's a great question, Mark, this is Tim. So, I just want to tell you we were always partially hedged on interest rates. And based on the improved funding level that we saw near the end of the quarter, we did increase that partial hedge to a higher amount. We can disclose all of that when we come back and re-measure in our, I guess, it'd be in our fourth quarter call at the end of January, but we felt pretty good coming out of the third quarter. The pension risk transfer, we thought was a very good move for us to make. And based on the improved funding level that we were experiencing at the end of the third quarter, that gave us the confidence to also make the shift on our asset allocation to increase the fixed income exposure and take down equities. Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : And so, at this point, is it \u2013 do you feel that you are, under most scenarios, pretty well-protected or is it \u2013 again, is it kind of dependent on how things play out in various markets? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: No, I think we feel like we've reduced risk greatly and that we're well-protected. And, of course, when we re-measure and we put out our annual number, we can share more details about that but I think we feel pretty good right now. Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Okay. Great. And just to follow up, just to make sure I'm kind of understanding the thought process on share repurchase. On the one hand, you've described a systematic approach. And then you also suggested it would be consistent cadence based on value. And so, I guess \u2013 I think, systematic, that sort of typically wouldn't include too much of a waiting to where the stock might be trading at any given point in time. And yet that other comment of consistent cadence based on value, I guess, made me think that actually you are going to be fairly conscious of where the stock might be trading as you make these decisions. How should I be bringing those two comments together? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah, it's a good question, Mark. And I think what we've said is we want to try to do both. We have not always purchased shares in a very consistent fashion over time. It's been very episodic, both in terms of timing and in terms of amount. And I think what we were talking about was systematic as we're going to be thoughtful about how we look at share repurchases versus other options for capital allocation. But we also always want to keep in mind our view of intrinsic value and buy below that. So, yeah, it's \u2013 will it always line up? I'm not sure. But we want to have a posture where we, on a more regular basis, are in the market buying our shares where we see value. Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner, Barclays Capital. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Mark; good morning, Tim. Tim, just going back to the dividend policy for a minute, I just want to clarify. Because if I look at the dividend rate, it was about 40% \u2013 a little bit over 40% of the free cash flow last year, probably a similar amount this year with the growth in the business. Are we looking at 40% to 50% of the mid-cycle free cash flow generation? Is that how we're thinking about the dividend policy on a go-forward basis? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. We've pressure-tested it under a lot of different scenarios. But even under trough scenarios what we're saying is we're committed to 40%, 50% of free cash flow on an ongoing basis. We want it to be sustainable. We think, given our view of normalized and trough margin levels and cash flow, that we can return the current dividend at the $2 per share under most scenario \u2013 most all scenarios, trough-tested and as well as normalized. So it's a view of returning free cash flow under any circumstance except maybe something like we experienced in 2008, but we view it as sustainable throughout the cycle, up and down. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. I hope nobody's planning for that type of recession again. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: So do I. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: When we look at the EBITDA margins in the North American Industrial Packaging business, they have expanded quite significantly this year. I think you said almost 24% in the quarter. I mean how do you think about the sustainability of those margins on a go-forward basis because you did kind of get the added benefit of a price increase early in the year and then as we talked about before, the OCC price dropping. So just how do you view the sustainability of those margins? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Well, if you look at our history, I think we've been within a fairly tight range through a lot of different macro factors. If you go back to 2015 and 2016, we were still in the 22% range. So I think, over the past five, six, seven years, we've demonstrated, within a band, our ability to manage our margins by the way we choose to participate in the various channels that we operate in as well as the investments that we've made in our facilities, the lower costs and improve supply chain capability. You're not immune from the market. But I think Mark alluded to it earlier and talked about our ability to manage through different types of circumstances given our size and our capability, I totally agree with that. Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: So, Scott, I'll just add to Tim's comment. I think you'll see \u2013 if you go back and look at recent history, you'll see our strongest margins tend to occur when the economy is the strongest, which also tends to be, at the same time, some of our cost \u2013 input costs are up and have pressure. And then if you put all that together, there's a huge leverage on the demand side of the equation. So at a 2.9% or 3% GDP economy in North America, we have a business that's capable of generating in the margin range of 24%, in the mid-20s. When we have less than 1%, which we had just a couple \u2013 a few years ago, we had about 22% margins. And it follows logic in a way based on the price-cost relationship and what's happening in our customers' lives. When they're moving their product, we're there to serve for them, we have the flexible capacity, our margins tend to be a little higher. When the economy is slower, they tend to be a little lower. But from a result standpoint, we had strong results at 22% from a return basis and stronger results at 24%. But you also have the ability to look at the high and the low being a relatively narrow band now versus a long time ago where there was a huge swing in margins based on economic outlook. So, that's why we feel confident about in the company we built, and in particular, this part of the company that we've built. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Mark; and thanks, Tim, congrats on a strong quarter despite some headwinds. Operator : And our final question for today comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: ... of your white paper tonnages outside of North America. Can you talk about how different the demand trends in those markets look to you from your vantage point? Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Hi, Mark. It's Tim, could you repeat that? I'm sorry we missed the first part of your question. It cut out. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Sorry. I'm just thinking about how much of your white paper business is outside the U.S. It's a heck of a lot and so I'm just curious. We tend to focus too much on what the U.S. market is doing. I wonder if you could just share with us your sort of global view of your different white paper markets and their outlooks. Tim S. Nicholls - International Paper Co.: Yeah. It varies region by region. Latin America has been very good for us. Brazil has been up and down as you might expect from the economic performance in the country. Russia has been very stable and solid. We've actually not been able to meet all of the demand that we had in Western and the Eastern Europe because of the fire that we had earlier in the year at Kwidzyn and the amount of capacity that we lost. So, yeah, I mean, it's \u2013 there are secular trends everywhere to varying degrees, but there's also differences in usage that make some regions less susceptible, we think, over time to the types of secular decline that we've experienced here in North America. The usage here, on a per capita basis as you know, Mark, was extremely high in North America. The rest of the world never had those type of per capita use numbers. And so we see stable demand across most of the other regions that we operate in. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, that's super helpful. And as long as we're on the topic of Russia, you've talked in the past about wanting to potentially expand your position in Ilim or certainly seeing Ilim itself expand. Are there any updates on capacity expansion or growth plans at Ilim? Mark S. Sutton - International Paper Co.: Good, morning Mark, this is Mark. We have a tremendous business over there and really good business partners and we've said we'd like to continue to do more with Ilim because of its competitive position and we are pursuing as was previously discussed, Ilim's capital plan \u2013 normal capital plan to expand our softwood pulp capacity. We also have a competitive kraftliner business there that's perfectly suited to serve certain specific needs in Asia, a narrower grade range but an important grade range, and so it's a good business. There's obviously a geopolitical component to it but on the ground with our employees, with our respective governments, the business has really never operated better and it's got more growth potential. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments. Guillermo Gutierrez - International Paper Co.: Thank you again for joining our third quarter earnings call. As always, Michele and I will be available for follow-up questions. Have a great day. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's International Paper Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter 2018 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information presented on those slides. I will now turn now the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide three. International Paper delivered very strong earnings in 2018, with strong performance across our three businesses, achieving a second consecutive year of 16% EBITDA growth. Our Ilim joint venture also delivered excellent results with operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion. All in, we continue to grow value for our shareholders with the return on invested capital of 13% which is significantly above our cost of capital. During the year, we invested strategically to further strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. Among these investments, we opened a new box plant in Toluca, Mexico, that will be fully integrated with containerboard provided from our U.S. mill system. We also made targeted investments in our U.S. Box business to enhance our capabilities with a deliberate focus on serving the fastest-growing segments and being aligned with the best customers. These investments all have returned to more than 25%. We also took decisive measures to further derisk the company and strengthen our balance sheet. We paid down $500 million in debt, bringing our leverage ratio down to 2.8 times and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which reduced our diluted shares outstanding by 3%. Turning to the full year results on slide four. Our revenue increased by more than 7% and we expanded our margins by 150 basis points on strong commercial performance across our businesses. Our equity earnings were $336 million, including $290 million from our Ilim joint venture. All in, we delivered another strong solid year of free cash flow. Turning to slide five. International Paper delivered a very strong year of return on invested capital. We increased our five-year average to 11%. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio. We are making the right investment choices and delivering on those commitments. I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our businesses and our first quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6 which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Operating earnings improved by $1.83 driven primarily by price and mix improvement across our three businesses. Operations and costs were negatively impacted by weather events during the year and startup costs associated with the Madrid mill. Ops and costs were also impacted by LIFO inventory revaluation charges related to price activity in 2018. Input costs were a headwind in 2018 driven by higher wood, chemicals and distribution which were partially offset by lower OCC. Corporate expenses, interest and taxes were lower and equity earnings improved on strong performance in Ilim and the benefit of Graphic Packaging. As Mark said, International Paper delivered very strong results in 2018. Turning to slide 7, our fourth quarter results. EBITDA improved by 8% year-over-year as we expanded margins in our three businesses. Our equity earnings were $79 million including $67 million from our Ilim joint venture and $10 million from Graphic Packaging. Free cash flow in the quarter was solid and we completed $200 million in share repurchases. All in the company finished on a strong note. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide 8. Operating earnings improved by $0.09. Price and mix improved in all businesses and regions. Operations in cost improved due to lower Madrid mill startup costs and favorable one-time items of about $20 million. The fourth quarter was the lowest maintenance outage quarter of the year representing less than 10% of our total maintenance outage expense in 2018. Input costs were a headwind particularly for energy and wood. We expect hardwood cost to remain elevated due to poor operating conditions from heavy rains. Now let me turn to the segments. Starting with Industrial Packaging on slide 9. The North American business performed very well delivering $641 million in earnings and a 25% EBITDA margin. Box demand was strong driven by e-commerce and produce and we continue to see strong box demand as we enter 2019 with shipments in January we're estimating between 1.5% and 2%. Export containerboard came under pressure in the fourth quarter with demand slowing in China and some other -- in some regions in EMEA. We're also seeing the impact of higher tariffs in Turkey which is a major importer of U.S. containerboard. We expect volume and price pressure to continue in the first quarter as inventory destocking plays out. Continuing with the fourth quarter performance. Operations and cost benefited from onetime items, which were largely offset by higher distribution cost. Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter due to higher natural gas and wood cost. Fourth quarter was another good example of the strength of our Industrial Packaging team and their ability to execute well. On slide 10. The Global Cellulose Fibers business delivered earnings of $93 million in the fourth quarter. Earnings were largely in line with our expectations with the exception of input costs, which were impacted by higher wood and energy again. We delivered a strong fourth quarter against a changing macro backdrop. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a softening in softwood and fluff demand in China along with slowing demand in Turkey largely due to foreign currency headwinds. These trends have continued into the seasonally slower first quarter as customer destocking plays out and we move into the Chinese New Year. Printing Papers on slide 11. The business delivered excellent results, driven by strong commercial and operating performance. Price realization and volume were favorable across all geographies. Again input costs were a headwind due to the higher wood and energy costs. Overall a very strong quarter and year. In North America, our uncoated free sheet volume outpaced industry shipments for the year. Our Europe and Russia Papers businesses delivered solid earnings of about $130 million, overcoming high wood costs and other operational challenges. And in Brazil, earnings for the year improved by 17% and our EBITDA margins continue to be very healthy in the low 30% range. All in, we have good momentum as we move into 2019. Now, I'll turn to Ilim. Ilim's results on slide 12. The joint venture delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter with operating EBITDA of $310 million. Volume was higher with no planned maintenance outages in the fourth quarter. International Paper's equity earnings were $67 million and were impacted by a noncash foreign exchange charge on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $19 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter. For the full year, Ilim operating EBITDA was $1.2 billion, which represents a 45% margin. IP's equity earnings were $290 million. Overall, the business performed very well and provided $128 million in cash dividends to IP in 2018. Turning to slide 13 and our first quarter outlook. I'll take you through all of the puts and takes by business. So, starting with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to be down $15 million, driven by containerboard exports. Volume is expected to be down $40 million on seasonally lower volume in North America and lower export containerboard volume as customer destocking continues into the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to increase by $100 million largely due to unabsorbed fixed costs related to lower volume, higher seasonal energy consumption as well as inflation and the non-repeat positives from the fourth quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging. Planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $102 million and input costs are expected to be flat. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be down $5 million and volume to be down $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to increase by $50 million due to unabsorbed fixed costs related to lower volume, higher seasonal energy consumption as well as inflation and the non-repeats from the fourth quarter. Planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $20 million. So all-in this will be a significant reduction for the business in the quarter. So, let me add some color on Cellulose Fibers. Earlier I shared the macro environment in certain regions of the world. Complicating that for us a poor commercial decision was made that is going to negatively impact our fluff pulp volume in the quarter. While I believe this is only a temporary setback, it is going to take us until sometime between the second and the third quarter of this year to fully resolve. However, it does not change our belief in the fundamentals of the business and our ability to create value over time. Moving to Printing Papers. Price and mix are expected to be down $10 million due to seasonal mix in Brazil. Volume is expected to be down $10 million from lower seasonality in Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to increase by $35 million driven by higher seasonal energy inflation and timing of spending. Staying with Printing Papers, planned maintenance outages are expected to increase by $3 million and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million on continued pressure on hardwood in North America. Under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging. In other items, we include corporate and interest expense as well as our estimated effective tax rate of 24% to 26%. We expect our full year corporate expense to be $70 million and interest expense to be $500 million. I'll move to the full year outlook on slide 14. We are projecting full year EBITDA for the company of between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion. Our North American Industrial Packaging business is performing well and domestic box demand is strong. In Europe, the benefits of the Madrid mill will accelerate through the year. Volume recovery in our fluff pulp business is against the backdrop of 4% growth in the market and our Papers business is performing very well. Putting all of these together, we expect strong free cash flow of $2 billion among other positive factors that will impact our cash flow; CapEx is planned at $1.4 billion; and we expect to receive $200 million in dividends from Ilim. As we did in 2018, we will use our free cash flow for debt reduction and cash to shareholders. We are committed to a strong and sustainable dividend and we have a $2.2 billion share repurchase authorization. On slide 15, we made progress strengthening our balance sheet as Mark referenced in 2018. We reduced balance sheet debt by $500 million, our pension plan is sufficiently funded and we took definitive actions to further derisk the plan. In 2018, we also reduced our cash balance by $400 million. Effectively we put this cash to better use by applying it toward debt reduction and share repurchases. Going forward, we expect our cash balance will remain in the $600 million range. So, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. I just want to take this opportunity to share my views on International Paper and the year we have ahead of us in 2019. Coming off of strong record earnings in 2018 with really solid performance across the portfolio, and more importantly, we strengthened our businesses and we strengthened the company as we head into 2019. Our businesses are stronger. We're well positioned to drive through any challenge we may face. We have the people, the innovation, the best value chain to solve our customer's needs and a low-cost high-quality manufacturing system to succeed. We're investing in high-return projects to improve our businesses all of which drives our strong cash generation. We've also improved overall International Paper. We're a stronger company. We're well positioned to grow free cash flow in 2019 meaningfully, and we're strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. To me it's all about value creation. That's what drives our decisions. And we're looking forward to 2019. And with that, we are ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Just looking at Industrial Packaging, it seems like your January shipments are stronger than what you saw on 4Q. And that seems consistent with what some of your competitors are saying. Is it possible to say what kind of drove the weakness in 4Q in terms of end markets or categories or regions? Tim Nicholls : Well, I think that \u2013 hi, Anthony, it's Tim. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Tim Nicholls : I think there were some strong comps that we were up against. We did finish the year very strong. December was a very good month for us at 2.5% and we see that continuing as we go into January. So part of its timing and part of it is the way the months lay out. But on balance, the fourth quarter for us was a pretty strong quarter. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just in your 1Q outlook and kind of prepared remarks you referenced export destocking. Any visibility in terms of how long that could take to run its course or where customer inventories are maybe relative to history? And then just kind of related question, how do you feel about your own internal containerboard inventory levels? I think some of your competitors have talked about opportunities to take inventories down but they have some projects and M&A situations that you don't. Just any kind of general thoughts you have on your own inventory levels. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I don't think the destocking is a long-term impact. Depending on the region of the world some things make it a little bit harder to see clearly like Chinese New Year. We always \u2013 every year we have this for pulp and to some extent containerboard, where buying stops ahead of Chinese New Year and then you have to see how it picks up, once everyone is back. We do know that in Europe there's customers inventories, especially given the tightness that existed through a lot of last year. There's probably safety stocks that we think are in place and it'll take a month or two for those to kind of flow through. I don't see it as being longer than that, but we'll have to see how it plays out. As far as our inventories, I think we feel good. We're adequately supplied. We've got tremendous flexibility. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Mark Wilde : I wonder Mark just to kind of start off, if you could talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that GP announcement down at Port Hudson affecting your business. I'm particularly interested in kind of the \u2013 well there's change of the timing around the Selma conversion and also whether you've announced a price increase in uncoated paper? Mark Sutton : That's a great question, Mark. The \u2013 specifically to the impact of changing supply in the uncoated free sheet business and its impact on our Selma conversion, the original reason and the reason we communicated about making that conversion was to go into high-quality bleached linerboard. And that's something we need for the places we're growing the box business. So it wasn't really a \u2013 the driver wasn't our white paper system. It was what we need for our packaging system and it's a great asset to do it. So we communicated a change into 2020 and right now we're sticking with that plan. We're going to need that product pretty quickly as we get into 2020 for the box growth that we are targeting and experiencing. So I don't see any change in that plan. What it does in terms of the market obviously is it just -- a continuing evolving change in the supply base as that product line and market goes through its normal evolution. So for us our Printing Papers business is well positioned. We've got great products, a full range of products and great customers. And we -- that business is still playing an important position on the team. Q \u2013 Mark Wilde : Okay. My follow-on question is really around capital allocation. And I'm just curious, it sounds like you guys pulled back pretty dramatically on capital projects in the fourth quarter. And I wondered if you could you just put a little color around the things that went into that decision. And it's also in the fourth quarter, it seemed like your cadencing on share repurchase was pretty much in line with what we had seen through the first three quarters of the year. And I'm just kind of curious about why you might not have accelerated that given the weakness in equities in the fourth quarter? A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes I'll take the second part of the... A \u2013 Mark Sutton : You take the second. I'll take the first yes. A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes. So we got our hand signals mixed up there for a minute. So yes I think Mark, what you saw on the fourth quarter was continuing to buy shares, but also making sure that we were applying cash to the balance sheet as well. And as I mentioned a minute ago or showed on the slide, we did get to the top end of our range in terms of leverage for the balance sheet. And there's opportunity to take that lower, but we expect we're going to have a lot of cash to apply to share repurchases as we go through this year as well. So it was just a choice. We had bought shares in the second and in the third. We continue to buy in the fourth and we paid down some debt at the same time. A \u2013 Mark Sutton : Mark on the capital projects, there was nothing that we did in the fourth quarter that's not somewhat normal as you look at finishing your year. Some projects move faster than you expected, some move slower and it was just a matter of managing the spending that we had committed to. This happens from time to time. It's just a little bit more activity. So we ended up where we thought we would end up right in the zone that we communicated to investors for total capital spending. And so when you have as many projects and as large an asset base, you just got to sync these stuff up toward the end of the year. So it's just a matter of changing the cadence of some of the final execution of these projects. Q \u2013 Mark Wilde : Okay, fair enough, thanks and good luck in '19. A \u2013 Mark Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Q \u2013 George Staphos : Thank you, operator. Hi, good morning, thanks for all the detail guys. I wanted to spend the first question probing some of the hopefully one-off related issues in the quarter that have implications in for 2019. Can you comment a bit on what was in the $20 million of one-off good guys I guess for 4Q? And can you comment on what the commercial decision in Cellulose Fibers is related to and why it will take until the middle of the year to correct that? And I have a follow-on. A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes, hey, George, it's Tim. The $20 million it's a bunch of things honestly. It's all at corporate and a lot of small items that added up to a bigger-than-usual number in the quarter. I think that's the best way to describe it. A \u2013 Mark Sutton : So George on the commercial decision, we make these type of decisions all the time running our businesses. And this particular decision had to do with trying to shift some of our customer mix for all the right reasons, to improve our margins, to actually improve customer service across our portfolio. We made some decisions and of course when you shift customer mix, you need to replace what you\u2019re shifting out of and shifting into. And what's happening is it's just taking us longer to do the second part of that. So our execution isn't as good as it has been when we've made these kind of decisions, but it's not an abnormal type of decision. It's just our execution is not something that we've done as well as we normally do on. It will be fine. It will just take us a little longer. The market is growing. We're outperforming the market. We'll continue to do that based on our portfolio of products and customers. We just had a shift project that's taking longer than we originally intended. Q \u2013 George Staphos : Mark, just to fill in some white space there. But ultimately you expect to replace whatever volume was lost I mean, that's my takeaway with fluff volume and fluff customers correct in terms of the shift? Mark Sutton : Yes. Yes, fluff volume, fluff customers and we fully expect to continue to perform very well. And we should perform better than the market based on our footprint of capability, but also our product portfolio. So absolutely, it's absorbent for absorbent. It's just in different customers in different regions at higher economic value. Q \u2013 George Staphos : Thank you. My second question and I'll do it quickly here. If we think about the free cash flow guidance for 2019 at $2 billion I recognize that's your guidance and so that's the number you want to stick to. But given that the markets are kind of in an interesting position in terms of the supply and demand there's some destocking pressure not for you but for others in some of your bigger markets, where do you think the tensions are on that free cash flow? Are we more apt to see holding price constant free cash flow be in excess of $2 billion? Or do you -- are you pulling every lever you can to get to that figure? Thank you and good luck in the quarter. Tim Nicholls : Yes, well we always try to pull all the levers for free cash flow, so that doesn't change. But I do think to your point George, the $2 billion is what we put out there, but I can see upside to it as we go through the year. Q \u2013 George Staphos : Thank you, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Two things. What has been happening and will happen now after GP to your white paper mix? And I'm curious whether you're seeing any meaningful difference in U.S. versus other markets in terms of how the decline in demand is playing out in terms of your particular mix? Mark Sutton : I think our mix Mark is staying pretty constant relative to the roll business for the printing industry the cut size business and some of the specialties we make. I think it's a little early to tell. Obviously, we are a major supplier. So we're seeing customers interested in us becoming their supplier post the GP announcement. But it's a little early to see what we're going to take and what it's going to do to our mix. But actually with the system we have now with essentially four mills -- 3.5 mills our mix is kind of ridden down with the decline because not all parts of the mix are declining at the same rate. But our facilities are pretty flexible, so we've continued to be able to optimize the mix for the best margin and best profitability. We should see pretty quickly here in the first quarter, how any incremental business that comes our way starts to shift that. Mark Connelly : Okay. So, you answered the flexibility question. Just one more. Can you give us a sense of how you're getting to your 1% to 2% growth estimate? Are you still thinking in terms of GDP plus? And what would drive a plus? I'm sorry I didn't... Tim Nicholls : Yes. I may not be responding to exactly what you're asking Mark this is Tim, but I referenced the 1.5% to 2%. That's what we were seeing in January. And I think fundamentally with the way we see the economy performing we expect it to be in that range. So, that's how we're looking not only at January, but I think that probably holds up for the year. Mark Sutton : So, Mark we've talked about this before. We acknowledged that sometime in the past, box demand and GDP kind of decoupled a bit. We actually have a model that we've developed with some outside resources and some internal data analytics that GDP is obviously a major function, but there are other indicators about how we think about box demand and it doesn't always track directly with GDP. There were periods where box demand slightly outperformed GDP, but we didn't conclude that it was now back on that track. So, it's a set of analytics we use. GDP is obviously a function and the input to GDP, but it's not just a GDP measure for us. Mark Connelly : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of Davidson. Steven Chercover : Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all IP makes about one in three boxes in North America and I think it's more like one in two for the big e-commerce player. I'm wondering if that's still the case. And how this alleged making the boxes more appropriate size-wise can you actually get paid for doing so? Tim Nicholls : We think we can. And yes I'd say your figures are directionally correct. I think the good news is we service a lot of customers in the e-commerce space and we work with all of them very closely, our design teams our commercial teams. And it's not just optimizing box size, its optimizing flow through fulfillment centers to make sure that they are getting the most efficiency in their fulfillment centers as well as getting it to the customers. So, it's not just -- is the box the absolute precisely the optimum box? It's what works in the broader system. Mark Sutton : The interesting thing Steve is that every e-commerce major player has a slightly different value proposition to customers and this velocity through their supply chain is more important to some than others. And so for the ones that it's as not as important you might actually be able to get to the perfect box even if it slows you down because that's their value proposition. But for others, there's a physics issue here that you've got to be able to load the product through the value chain. And so we're at the table with all the major people who sell direct and helping them to figure out not how to make a box smaller how to make their business model work better. And sometimes that changes the amount of packaging needed. Sometimes it actually improves our economics because of the way we're able to help them meet their goals. Steven Chercover : Terrific. Yes, that's what I wanted to clarify that it's not necessarily a negative just because the volume is lower. And my other quick question was with respect to Consumer Packaging. I mean you're not directly reporting it but you still have a lot of skin in the game. So, are you optimistic about the prognosis for the industry and are you happy with how your partner is behaving? Mark Sutton : I would say the investment we made with our business into Graphic is doing what we expected it to do. They're building out the business, integrating the SPS. We think that that is working out as intended. And I think the market is -- got a lot of potential because you see every day question marks about types of packaging, single-use packaging, sustainable versus non-sustainable, and I think it's going to be an interesting ride as we look at policy and we look at consumer preferences. But those products are pretty good pretty well-positioned for where the buyer and the public sentiment is going. Steven Chercover : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Adam Josephson : Tim, just one on the guidance. The one -- thanks for the bridge earlier. The EBITDA guidance seems like it's around $815 million, which seems to imply the year is going to be somewhat back-half weighted. I know maintenance costs are appreciably lower in the second half as they are every year. And I know you called out seasonality a fair bit. Is there a way to help us just with what the seasonality impact is in 1Q perhaps relative to the other three quarters? Just so we can get a figure out how you're getting to that full year guidance based on what you talked about for 1Q? Tim Nicholls : Yes, sure. I mean, directionally it's probably our lowest quarter from a demand standpoint seasonally. So it picks up in the second quarter. And it used to be that the fourth quarter was a weaker quarter as well, but we've seen that change over the past three or four years. Your comment on maintenance outages is correct. In the first half of the year we'll have roughly 80% of our maintenance outages completed, and then it drops off significantly in the third, and again, significantly in the fourth quarter as well. Adam Josephson : Okay. Thanks for that. And Mark on Europe, European containerboard prices are falling a fair bit. And obviously you're interested in getting into that market earlier last year. I mean, what are your thoughts about that market at this point with the overcapacity situation there the demand? And any implications of what's happening there for what may happen in the U.S. at some point down the road? Thank you. Mark Sutton : It's a good question, Adam. I think the European market is different than the U.S. and the price of containerboard and the price of boxes behave a little bit differently. I think I've made this comment before. With the recycled part of that industry, which is 75%, 78% of it, it's really a series of regional markets. So, lower containerboard prices on average in Europe don't mean a whole lot. It means something in a region, but not across Europe. And then there's always the spread between recycled linerboard and the virgin paper that's typically used because it's needed for some performance spec. And so that's how that market kind of frames up. And as far back as I can personally remember there's always been somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% overcapacity, nameplate capacity of containerboard versus demand. But because of that regional nature you had very good parts of the market even if you got an average overcapacity. We tend to be targeted right now in the southern part of Europe with a certain end-use box mix and largely are going to be mostly integrated on our recycled grades with Madrid. And we're integrated on our Kraftliner from the U.S. So we like our position we have right now. I think over time it'll depend on how the European industry evolves. But you've really got to think about, my premise is you have to think about it as multiple regional markets. Adam Josephson : Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Scott Gaffner : Good morning, Tim. Good morning, Mark. Just focusing on cash and the return of cash to shareholders. For a minute, I mean, if I look at the $1.65 billion of free cash flow in 2018 and you're pretty close to that 50% payout ratio on the dividend, but then on -- so one I guess just questioning whether you would increase the dividend further or maybe just some caution on doing that just as we get later into the current cycle. And then the second part is really on the share repurchase versus debt reduction. I mean you're right at the sort of long-term target on the balance sheet as far as net debt. I mean how should we think about debt reduction versus share repurchase at this point in the cycle? Tim Nicholls : Yes so, two good questions. The first on the dividend, we typically look at that once a year and we tend to do it in the fourth quarter. That's been our practice over the past seven or eight years and we'll continue to do that. The key is that, we want it to be sustainable. And so we'll evaluate how we're thinking about things when we come to it later this year. In terms of debt reduction and share repurchases as you can imagine, it would be somewhat situational and based on what we think of as the outlook that we're heading into. So we are in the range, but we're at the top end of the range on the balance sheet. We believe the balance sheet strength is foundational to the company, so we'll look at that very seriously. And if there is opportunities to buy our shares below what we believe intrinsic value to be, we're going to be very active on that as well. So what we're trying to do is saying, there's a lot of cash and it's going to be applied to debt reduction and share repurchase and we will be as thoughtful as we can be as to how we divide the two. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And how should we think about sort of the annual share creep as we go forward? Tim Nicholls : The annual share creep, are you talking about from incentive compensations? Scott Gaffner : From compensation correct. Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I'm not going to forecast what hasn't been fully approved yet because that comes later in the first quarter. But we said minimum share repurchases of dilution. We ended the year at 400 million shares and you saw what we did last year. And you see the guidance that we've given this year around how much cash we have for debt reduction and share repurchase. So it will be well -- I would imagine it will be well in excess of any dilution that we see from incentive comp. Mark Sutton : Yes, Scott. I think one way to think about what we're trying to do and it's a little bit different for International Paper over the prior period, but we're trying to figure out how to optimize for our shareholder base, the long-term returns through good investments and the short-term capital returns that happen through a dividend and share repurchases. And as we said last year, we have not been as systematic and as understandable in that area. We think we made a lot of progress in 2018 and we plan on continuing that in 2019. But the balance sheet being in that zone that Tim described 2.5 to 2.8 is really important to us. We think it's the right way to run a basic materials company and a company that is exposed to the kinds of economic cycles we are. But we do want to do and we're committed to doing a better job that shareholders understand on short-term capital returns and the longer-term returns that in many cases are the source of some of the cash flow that we actually have to allocate. The investments we made yesterday are producing this cash flow today. Scott Gaffner : Okay. Just one last quick one on box shipments, can you just talk about the cadence throughout the fourth quarter how you saw that progressed? Appreciate it. Tim Nicholls : Yes. It was fairly even October and November and then we finished strong in December. So on balance we had a strong quarter -- fourth quarter of 2018. Scott Gaffner : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : One point that you've made in the past is fluff pulp tends to have much more stable pricing than commodity paper grade pulp and certainly that's what we've been seeing so far. Now that, we've got a lot of the contracts now in place recognizing some reference to the commercial activity you talked about before, but are most of the contracts in place now that you have a good visibility for the great majority of what your fluff pulp pricing will be this year, or does that actually move with other indexes et cetera? Mark Sutton : A portion Mark of our mix is contracted for the year and we know what that visibility is. There's a portion of the mix that is not on long-term contracts and so we've got pretty good visibility. And it's a true statement that the absorbent pulp is much more resilient on a price \u2013 well from a price perspective. Again, there's always the question mark of how it compares to people who can make both softwood market pulp and fluff what's happening in the other market that's been under pressure. So you would typically see any available slowing capacity that could make fluff that has a qualified quality product to move into fluff. And that happens from time-to-time based on the health of the softwood market. I think we've seen a little bit of that play out as we went through the \u2013 especially the second half of the fourth quarter. But with the growth rate and the type of products that ultimately this pulp goes into we feel real good about the market itself and our position in the market. And we think pricing will continue to be much more resilient than a typical softwood pulp grade would be. Mark Weintraub : Sure. That makes a lot of sense. And just \u2013 given that you've got more of a global footprint than many of the other folks in the industry. I was hoping that you might provide a view on what you're seeing outside of North America and where there are maybe places of weakness or relative strength? Mark Sutton : I think we see what you see. I mean, you hear about Europe and some of the country-by-country distractions that are going on whether it's France, Germany or Brexit that all results in a slightly lower economic rate of growth in Europe. And we see that, that's what Tim was talking about on some of the containerboard comments on export both volume and price. We also see there is no secret that Chinese economy is slowing. We don't have a direct impact in some cases because of the types of products we sell there, but we see a demand change. And again, it's hard to figure out right now because of the overlay with Chinese New Year. And then I think, there's some disturbances on currency. Turkey's a great example. A lot of times that ends up being temporary, but that is a little bit of turmoil right now. Latin America is actually improving. I think our biggest exposure is what we make in Brazil and sell everywhere else in Latin America, mostly white paper. That's actually kind of looking up, because of the new government in Brazil and the stabilization other than what's happening of course in Venezuela which we have no exposure to. We feel pretty good about the stability of Latin America. But I think it's really Europe and how they've manage through their political issues and what ends up happening. I'm hopeful that, we figure out a solution between the U.S. and China on trade and the things that might be weighing on that whole exchange of commerce and we'll benefit, our customers will benefit and that's how that we benefit. So we're doing our part to try to influence policy and work on that as one of many voices. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thanks for the quick tour. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Q \u2013 Chip Dillon : Yes, good morning and thanks for all the details. I had a question on the maintenance change from year-to-year. It looks like it's going down maybe $20 million, $25 million. And I recall a year or so ago you talked about shifting from a 12-month to an 18-month rotation if I had that right and that would cause 2018 to be much higher or that -- 2019 would be I thought down closer to $60 million or even more. Maybe it was $100 million. But could you just talk to us what's going on with maintenance and maybe why it didn't fall as far as maybe if I heard you right a year ago as you thought it would? A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes, hey Chip, it's Tim. So I think what we said a year ago at this time was that on a normalized level, we saw maintenance outage spending in the $460 million to $470 million range and last year was an elevated year and we expected some decrease in 2019. But you do this planning to varying degrees in terms of how far out in time you go. And so as we're into the second half of the year and later in the year finalizing some of that planning there's a little bit more for 2019 than we thought there could have been in this time last year. But we constantly work that number too, so that's a target. And our goal is to try to bring it as low as possible. But that, I mean, that's really the simplest explanation for how it rolls up. Q \u2013 Chip Dillon : Okay. So in other words there could be more room down in the future? A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes. Q \u2013 Chip Dillon : Okay, okay. And then just back to the dividend. You guys have actually raised it at least once, but generally once a year for the last nine years. There are a lot of companies that tend to fall into different kind of screens when they start to get into double digits. And I know that it's very important that it remains sustainable so you don't want to get ahead of your skis on that, but what is your thought in terms of having some increase every year versus holding back and making it more meaningful and not raising it every year? Have you ever thought about that? A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Yes. And I think we go back to what we said about 40% to 50% of free cash flow. So we want it to be sustainable. We have a target range of free cash. And we look at longer term not just the year we're in, but longer-term planning about how we feel about that cash flow -- that cash flow stream. And we have a very good dividend today, but we also have as I mentioned earlier the option of returning more cash through share repurchases as well. So I'm not making a call one way or the other. I'm just saying that's the framework that we look at and that's the same framework we'll go through later this year when we evaluate it. Q \u2013 Chip Dillon : Okay. And then last one quickly on the whole -- on the Fluff Pulp business. How much would you say the issue with the customer shift is likely to take away this year? Maybe it's an EBITDA number that you can give us. And I assume it's all in the first half. And if you make the replacement as you expect could -- and let's say prices stay where they are, would there be any reason you wouldn't see the results whether it's EBITDA or EBIT in the fourth quarter be comparable or better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018? A \u2013 Tim Nicholls : Well, there's a lot of moving parts as you referenced some of them. But yes we think it's going to take us a couple of quarters for this to be fully resolved. I would hesitate to get into forecasting specific items across the company, but you see the impact in the first quarter from volume and the extra costs related to unabsorbed fixed. And as we referenced, we see it correcting itself in the second to third quarter and then we also provided how EBITDA is shaking out, we think, for the year. So I... Mark Sutton : Yes. I think that's the way to think about it. I mean the guidance we gave on full company full year EBITDA factors in the specific issue along with some others, but the specific issue we mentioned in Cellulose Fibers. And I would -- the way I think about it, we were on a very good trend. We're still on a good trend, except for this one issue that we'll recover from. So I think about it as sort of quarter-and-a-half, two-quarter pause in our integration of that business, outperforming the market, heading toward really being almost a year ahead of the investment plan. And we'll be in the second half of the year fully back on the track. And we factored that into the full year outlook. Had none of this happened, in a perfect world with hindsight, we would see that incremental improvement. So we left that incremental improvement on the table. We're going to do our best. It's only January 31, so we're going to do our best to close that gap. But that's our best thinking right now in terms of how that flows into the full year company outlook. Chip Dillon : Great. Thanks for the details. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good morning, guys. Mark Sutton : Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire : Mark, appreciate the color and the perspective you gave on the slide around value creation. One thing you didn't really mention on there was acquisitions. I'm just wondering, how you're really thinking about that these days, whether it be mill assets globally, or converting assets in different regions. Has that changed meaningfully in the last couple of months? And presumably, multiples have come down a little bit, or some of the public equity multiples have changed. Would that impact your thinking on uses of cash from here, so just general thoughts on M&A at this point? Mark Sutton : On the small types of acquisitions, where you could be talking about a box plant or something like that, there's always an opportunity to compare the economics of acquiring a plant in a location with a certain book of business, versus if you're already in that region, like the U.S. For us, we are everywhere, so we could organically invest the same amount of money or less in four plants and get exactly what we need, exactly where we need it. That typically ends up winning out for International Paper. It may not be the right decision for other companies, because they may have a total lack of capacity in an area, but for us, most of our investments that look and smell like acquisitions on the small end had been organic investments. But we'll always compare the options when we're looking to improve a part of the business, what's the best economic way to do it. And it's not simply just the financials. Do you like the location? Do you like the customers? Is it actually part of your strategy or is it just for sale? We don't like to buy things that are just for sale, if they're not part of the original strategic intent we have. And so I wouldn't say we'd never look at it, because it would be probably foolish to say that, because you could miss a good opportunity that's better than an organic investment. But that's how we think about it. The reason you haven't seen us do much of it, is we've had better options organically with our internal asset base. Brian Maguire : Okay. Appreciate the color. And then, just one last one on the -- back to the Cellulose Fibers issue. Just thinking about it operationally how this would work, will you be continuing to run that volume that you would have otherwise sold, and keep it in inventory until such time when you think you can find a home for it? Or operationally do you think you're just going to run those assets at a lower rate for the time being? And then, assuming you do find some new customers for it, do you think there'll be qualification period needed there? Or operationally do you think you're just going to run those assets at a lower rate for the time being? And then assuming you do find some new customers for it, do you think there'll be qualification period needed there? Or are we talking about stuff that's pretty ubiquitous and pretty easily qualified in with the kind of customers you usually deal with? Tim Nicholls : Yes, you're right. It does vary from customer to customer so there'll be probably some of all of that. To your question on running, I think we've been very straightforward about running our businesses to our customers' demand and making sure that we are optimizing our supply chain. And hence you saw the reference in the commentary of the unabsorbed fixed charge that we'll have in the quarter because we won't be running and covering that fixed cost. Mark Sutton : I think the other reality on the replacement is in most cases it is with existing customers. It's just a matter of capturing that growth. Some of those customers are in the macro backdrop that Tim described around the last part of the fourth quarter with some slowing demand heading into Chinese New Year; some like in containerboard with a very tight fluff pulp market; some buying patterns that occurred when you could get it; and then some destocking. If you think about interruptions we -- just our company had, and we're a large player, we had some operating issues earlier in the year we shared with you and then we had a hurricane and other things that I think for customers they say, man I better get what I can get now if it's qualified. So, that's part of what's happening. It's just the ability for that to regain traction. The good news is it's the kind of product in most cases that we're already qualified on with many existing accounts that are growing at rates higher than the average. So, that's why I'm really confident we'll be able taking -- it's going to take a little longer than our original plan hence why we termed the decision a poor decision. We didn't just -- we just didn't have the execution of the recovery properly done. Brian Maguire : Okay, appreciate the color guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. The first one centers around, I guess, mill outage or production. 2018 kind of struck me as a pretty heavy year. You guys had roughly 520,000 tons of lost production from maintenance. Is there any way to help us understand what 2019 could look like given what you know now and what you plan to do in the mills? Or I guess maybe in another way is there incremental production that you would have access to that you otherwise didn't in 2018 due to the maintenance? Tim Nicholls : Well, there's always a lot of puts and takes around capital projects that are completed during the current year and you get the benefit of it next year. Maybe the way to think about it is just from a dollar standpoint. In 2018, we spent $548 million on outages and we're guiding to $525 million this year. But as I referenced in an earlier comment we're always looking to do that more efficiently and evaluate whether certain things absolutely have to be done or not. So, we're going to -- we have the target of $525 million, but we're obviously going to try to be lower than that in terms of our spending. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then can you remind us any debottlenecking efforts that you completed in 2017 or 2018 that would flow through into 2019 in terms of again incremental capacity? And I don't -- I apologize if you said Mark, if you confirmed that you did or did not go out with a price increase in the white paper? Mark Sutton : Gabe, I didn't answer that question. So as we always say pricing, especially forward-looking pricing is really between International Paper and our customers. So you didn't miss anything. Tim Nicholls : The only big material debottlenecking was our Maysville containerboard mill, which is a non-integrated mill. It produces recycled --sorry, lost my train of thought for a minute, our recycled containerboard. So we had a major project that, I think it started back in late July and it took us about 30-plus days to complete the project itself and it's running well. But other than that it's just the normal small stuff, the benefits that you get from maintenance outages and things like that. Gabe Hajde : Thank you, gentlemen, and good luck in the year. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn of RBC Capital. Paul Quinn : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on this line of question around cellulose pulp. Just -- I'm trying to get idea to what you think the China slowdown right now. How much of that is a factor the U.S. - China trade issue? And then if you could outline sort of in broad strokes what your percentage exposure to the Chinese market is on pulp for SBSK and I guess NBSK at Ilim? Mark Sutton : I think the cost of the slowdown, how much of it is related to the U.S. - China trade discussion is hard to predict. I hear all kinds of assessments of it. But clearly if China was in the high-single digits in terms of growth and now they're in the mid to low I think a reasonable expectation is that -- a catalyst for that is the kind of uncertainty that's been put in place with these trade negotiations. That's why I think underlying demand is not really changing all that much. But when you're not sure about the trade environment you -- and the Chinese are very good at inventory management, you just use your inventory for a while. So we are speaking with all of our customers, trying to understand are consumers buying less of the product, it's the type of product that typically that doesn't happen unless you just can't afford it? Or is it you have enough inventory and we don't need the input material, which is the fluff pulp in its greater quantities? So, for your second part of the question. For our absorbent product pulp, so the fluff pulp category about 33% of our product goes into China. Operator : Thank you. I'll now return the call to Guillermo Gutierrez for any additional or closing remarks. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, again, for joining International Paper's fourth quarter earnings call. As always Michele and I will be available for follow-up questions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 International Paper earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, we would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2019 International Paper Company Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Holly. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us International Papers First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our first quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and strong free cash flow in the first quarter. We performed well against a more challenging demand backdrop especially in our export markets operational performance was strong. We manage costs well and leverage the strength and flexibility of our system in a high downtime quarter. Overall, input costs were favorable in the quarter with lower recovered fiber cost largely offsetting higher wood costs that were caused by the heavy rainfalls in the southern United States. Taking a look at demand in North America box shipments slowed in the first quarter as customers drew down inventories and we experienced other near-term demand headwinds. However, we continue to see a favorable macro backdrop supportive of continued corrugated box growth. Inventory destocking among containerboard and absorbent pulp export customers is playing out as we expected and as we discussed last quarter. We anticipate our shipments to recover as the year progresses. In the first quarter, we generated $440 million of free cash flow and we returned nearly $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Continuing with our first quarter results on Slide 4, EBITDA was $896 million, that's a 4% improvement year-over-year which reflects solid operational performance across our three businesses. Our equity earnings were $114 million including $101 million from our Ilim joint venture and $13 million from our investment in graphic packaging. Free cash flow increased by almost $270 million year-over-year driven by higher cash from operations as well as lower planned capital spending in 2019. Although, it's not part of our first quarter free cash flow, I do want to note that in early April we received a $237 million cash dividend from Ilim. I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover the performance across our business sectors and our second quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. I'm on Slide 5 which shows or quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Price and mix were stable in the first quarter with higher average prices in our North American box business offset by lower export prices and containerboard and cellulose fibers as well as a weaker mix in Latin American papers. Volume decrease driven primarily by lower seasonal demand and North American packaging and Brazil papers as well as lower export containerboard and pulp shipments as export destocking continued in the first quarter as we've had expected. Operations and costs were impacted by economic downtime in the quarter. No performance, however, was strong. We managed cost well and optimize our system in a heavy downtime quarter. Planned maintenance outage expense was $143 million in the quarter reflecting an increase of $100 million versus the fourth quarter. Input costs were favorable with lower recovered fiber largely offsetting higher wood. Energy costs were also lower and distribution costs moderated in the first quarter. Lastly, equity earnings were favorable quarter-over-quarter. Ilim equity earnings benefited from stronger operations as well as a $21 million non-cash foreign currency gain in the quarter. So now let me turn to the segments starting with industrial packaging on Slide 6. The business delivered $421 million in earnings. Price and mix were favorable due primarily to margin and mix in our North American box business which was partly offset by weaker export pricing. With regard to volume the first quarter is our seasonally slowest quarter in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, in the U.S. we experienced weaker box shipments which we believe is short term in nature. It is mainly driven by customer inventory drawdown and other regional dynamics such as flooding in the Midwest and a late harvest on the West Coast. Some of these issues continued into April. But as Mark said, we continue to see a favorable economic environment that's supportive of box growth as we move into the second half of this year. Export containerboard shipments remain weak with quarter with customer destocking in the quarter progressing as expected and we see destocking continuing into April although at reduced levels. Against this demand backdrop, we had economic downtime in our North American mill system as we managed our production to meet our customer's needs. Production in the first quarter was also influenced by a significant reduction of our in-transit inventory between mills and box plants. Essentially as the speed in our supply chain increased from the mills to box plants, we've been able to manage the system with lower inventories. We think that adjustment was completely made in the first quarter. That said, operational performance was strong as we delivered -- as we leverage the strength and flexibility of our system. We manage direct variable costs well by optimizing fiber and energy costs across the system to mitigate the impact of downtime in the quarter. Taking a look at input costs, firewood was largely offset by lower recovered fiber while distribution in energy was favorable versus prior quarter. Our softwood inventories recovered as we exited the first quarter and costs are normalizing. Staying with industrial packaging we continue to execute our strategy to integrate the Madrid mill. In the first quarter, we completed a box plant swap to further increase our box system density in Spain. In effect, we exchange the plant located in Northern France one located in Spain. Earlier this month, we also announced the acquisition of three converting facilities located in Portugal and France. This acquisition comes as an opportunity related to the EU requirements regarding the clearance of DS Smith's acquisition Europac. When completed this acquisition further expands our capabilities and creates additional integration value with the Madrid Mill. Coming back to containerboard exports on Slide 7, we wanted to give you a sense of what we're seeing from our customers. Demand in Latin America is good as customer inventories have largely normalized during the first quarter. In Europe, we're seeing the effects of the poor fruit and vegetable winter season which resulted in high customer inventory levels as well as weak durable goods production both of which are important uses of Kraftliner. The spring fruit and vegetable season, however, look strong. Our customers are still managing through high inventory levels which we expect to play out during the second quarter. I want to take a moment to discuss Turkey one of the larger fruit and vegetable exporting countries and an important Kraftliner market for International Paper historically. We're facing structural challenges due to the impact of tariffs and a strong U.S. dollar in addition to weaker demand due to the recession in Turkey. All of which, we expect will negatively impact our Kraftliner exports to Turkey in the foreseeable future. Within the Middle East and Africa, inventory destocking is progressing as expected customer demand is reasonably strong and we expect shipments to improve in the second quarter. In Asia, demand in China has seen a modest improvement since Chinese New Year as inventories remain high. In Southeast Asia, high customer inventory levels continue to play out and may limit shipments in the second quarter. Overall, destocking is progressing largely as we anticipated with different demand and inventory dynamics by region. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. The effective price and mix lowered earnings $11 million in the first quarter. Conditions were largely as expected with a modest improvement in demand for softwood and absorbent pulp following the Chinese New Year. The impact from tariffs and inventory destocking in China evolved as expected. Economic downtime impacted operations and cost in the quarter. That said, our mills ran well and we have -- and we had strong operational performance. We optimized marginal cost for fiber and chemicals across the system. Looking at the quarter, we had good execution in a challenging environment that is playing out largely as anticipated. Longer term, we feel good about absorbent pulp demand and more importantly about our unique capabilities to provide value to customers. We shared with you some of these advantages previously. It's our innovation capabilities and unmatched regional service model that allows us to understand and develop fluff fibers or different consumer and cultural preferences. All of that being backed up by a multi mill system that has flexibility. Turning now to printing papers on Slide 9. The business performed well with strong results in North America and Europe. Price and mix gains in North America and Europe were largely offset by weaker geographic mix in Latin America. Lower first quarter volume was driven by seasonality in Brazil and lower exports to the rest of Latin America. Operations and costs were higher attributed mostly to expected seasonal cost in North America. And input costs were favorable with cost mitigation across the system offsetting continued hardwood cost pressure in North America due to heavy rainfall across the southern U.S. Overall, a solid first quarter and an $80 million year-over-year improvement in earnings. Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The J.V. delivered solid commercial and operational performance in the first quarter with operating EBITDA of $254 million. International Paper's equity earnings were $101 million and benefited from a non-cash foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt of which IP's after tax portion was $21 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter. As Mark shared with you earlier, we received a $237 million cash dividend in early April. This brings IP's total cash dividends received from Ilim to about $900 million since the start of the joint venture. Turning to Slide 11. I'll cover our second quarter outlook. Overall, we expect stronger seasonal demand across our businesses as we execute our highest planned maintenance outage quarter of the year. So, now let me take you through business by business. Starting with industrial packaging. We expect the effective price and mix the lower earnings $20 million to mostly to export pricing. Volume is expected to improve by $25 million on seasonally stronger volume in North America with one last shipping day. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $55 million due to an improved fixed costs absorption in North America as well as better ops and cost in North America and Europe. Staying with Industrial Packaging maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $37 million and input costs are expected to improve by $40 million on lower wood and recovered fiber cost as well as improved energy and distribution costs. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect the effective price and mix to lower earnings $15 million and volume to improve by $five million in the second quarter. Operations and costs are expected to remain stable with improved fixed cost absorption offset by higher expected manufacturing spending in the quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $32 million and input costs are expected to improve by $5 million on lower wood cost. In printing papers, we expect to see a $5 five million benefit on the recent price increase in North America. Volume is expected to improve $20 million on stronger seasonal demand in North America and Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to be unfavorable by $five million on several onetime items and maintenance expense is expected to increase by $44 million. Let me add a comment on our planned maintenance outages for 2019. The second quarter is our highest maintenance outage quarter at $256 million. So across the system we will have completed 75% of planned maintenance outages during the first half of the year. And lastly, under equity earnings you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture and graphic packaging. I'd note that Ilim's second quarter outlook includes a $15 million increase in maintenance outage expense and repairs versus the first quarter. Taking a look at our full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see a favorable macro environment in packaging for North America and we expect exports to continue recovering. Our Printing Papers business is performing well with realization of price increases in North America. For the full year, we're projecting EBITDA of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. We're using free cash flow for debt reduction and cash to share owners. We're committed to strong and sustainable dividend and have just over $two billion of share repurchase authorization remaining after the first quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 180 million shares at an average price of $45.66. All in, we return just over 85% of free cash flow to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases. So, with that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. You know as I sit here and think about the start to our year what really stands out to me is that we delivered another quarter of solid performance and strong free cash flow. Once again International Paper demonstrated the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver solid financial results under varying market conditions. Looking ahead, we see a favorable economic backdrop for our products as we navigate through any near-term conditions. We built a resilient company that allows us to succeed and create value for our shareholders by investing in our people our customers and our operations. And we're doing what we said we would do, growing free cash flow maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. And with that we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi. Good morning. Mark Sutton : Good morning, Debbie. Debbie Jones : My first question is on a domestic box and you called out weather and customer destocking with that the majority of the shortfall versus your expectations. And then I was hoping you could comment on the confidence you have that you do start seeing the improvements in April whether it's kind of broader macro or some underlying things around certain segments that encourage? Mark Sutton : It's a great question and probably the $64,000 question. Look on April we saw some things that were sort of one off like the delayed harvest in California we know they're out of drought we know the crops are there the harvest is coming in and it's going to start later. So we feel good about that and in our supply chain visibility to customers we have seen the destocking rate begin to slow down. So we feel pretty confident about that.  Longer term, when you look out for the rest of the year, Debbie, we look at a number of macroeconomic indicators that we feed into a model that gives us a sense of a range of box demand and those macroeconomic models that we use and those indicators are still by external agencies being forecast to be relatively firm. So we feel good about solid conditions going forward and really a better second half as we look at the general economic indicators that correlate the most with box demand. Debbie Jones : Okay, thanks. And my follow up question just on the full year guidance. Can you just talk about what drove the reduction? I think some of it must have been the $10 cut and PPW on containerboard. And then Jim comment also if you actually saw that in the market and then how to kind of correlate that with no change to the free cash flow guidance? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, we have -- Debbie, it's Tim. We thought we had headroom in free cash flow we call that out on last quarter's call. And so we feel really good about the $2 billion being solid at this point. And in terms of the guidance -- you're right it is acknowledging that there was a $10 published down but also just acknowledging that there was some additional weakness in export markets than what we were thinking about 3 months ago. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one might start with Ilim. Seems like operations and shipments and everything there seems pretty strong. Can you comment at all about sort of the trajectory or outlook for the full year in that business? And then what you're thinking about or what the organization is thinking about in terms of expanding capacity there's been some reports out there that suggests they're looking to make an investment over the next couple of years. Mark Sutton : Gabe, I don't think we heard the first part. Where you talking about Ilim? Gabe Hajde : Yes. Ilim. Mark Sutton : Yeah. Thanks Gabe. Ilim -- the thing about Ilim is that we've got the best cost and operational position in the world to serve the largest growing market for softwood fibers that are targeted to our tissue towel and packaging. And that coupled with absorbent business we have in the US gives us a really strong position but specifically for Ilim they're continuing to see growth. They see the same thing that everybody sees in the fibers market in China. China's economy has slowed down a little bit. There has been some pricing pressure but Ilim is continuing to grow. You can see the EBITDA performance and the performance on the IP side of the shareholder arrangement with the dividends and equity earnings. Ilim also has the ability to adjust their cost structure like we do in North America through a sophisticated approach to how to variable as much of what looks like fixed cost is possible and they're continuing to make progress on that. So I think the future is really bright for Ilim. As far as future development, there are some projects that have been publicly talked about that's normal in that part of the world to start talking about possible investments to get everybody lined up all the constituents, cities, governments, banks all of that type of thing. But to this point there's nothing formally approved about the next phase of pulp production. We have been doing some things for the packaging business in Russia and in Eastern Europe around containerboard and some box but there is there is a bright future for Ilim as the primary softwood fiber source for the Asian markets. Gabe Hajde : Okay. Thank you. And then switching gears I guess the cellulose fibers business, there was discussion on the prior quarter call about a commercial decision sounded like maybe some destocking. Also, can you update us on how that's progressing through I guess the first half here. And then visibility into that and getting a little bit better maybe on the volume front and the back half. Mark Sutton : I think that's exactly our view. We had two main causes for our volume shortfall if you will on the absorbent side and that is the customer decision, we talked about last quarter that you referenced. And also, if you recall, we were talking about some uncertainty about Chinese demand. It was in the Chinese New Year period whether there was going to be a snap back in demand post Chinese New Year or a gradual return. We see more of the gradual return outside of China we have really good demand in the other regional markets in parts of Europe and Latin America the rest of Asia. And so we think that when everybody looks at what's happening in China and you see certain things starting to turn some economic stimulus starting to be injected we feel pretty good about the ability to be on the volume recovery plan we had that we described a quarter ago as we go through the year. I hate to keep saying in second half but in this case China's such an important market as they start to come out of the relative slowdown they had last fourth quarter and the beginning of this year we'll see the benefits of that in our Cellulose Fibers business. Gabe Hajde : Thank you, Mark. Good luck. Mark Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Hi. Good morning everyone. Thank you. First question is, you mentioned the -- Tim did the Ilim dividends total $900 million. I seem to recall your investment in Ilim has been all in less than that. I think when he did the investment about 10-12 years ago. Could you just update us on that please? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, all in roughly $685 million, Chip. So yeah, we've now recovered more than what we have in the investment. Chip Dillon : Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then a second question. Could you just update us on the timing of the conversion that you planned at the Riverdale mill? I know the last comment was a little bit. There was a bit of a range of dates. I think first half or first quarter or first half I think were the terms where does that stand now. And you know are you because of the -- you know incremental looseness in the market not to mention the strength in white paper. You know considering maybe pushing that to the second half or to some other period. Mark Sutton : Chip, that's a very good question and you know we did talk about it I think last quarter. Just a quick reminder on the Riverdale conversion it's bleached white top high-performance liner something that we currently don't make that exact product in our current mill portfolio. So that project is about giving IP capability in the box markets for the high print segments. And so what we talked about was a little bit of a range right now what we're what we're planning on is first quarter of 2020. And it's because of the product that we're going to make at Riverdale. It's not more of the same type of containerboard we're already making. We don't know. Obviously, no one knows exactly what supply demand and what our order book is going to look like. But we're quite confident that when we bring that product on if we have to adjust our output in other ways in other ways in our system that we've got the capacity to do that based on our order book and if you remember when we brought value on that was also a different product it was lightweight medium that we had sold basically after the Temple acquisition and we were bringing some of it back in house. We brought that on in a period where we didn't need 100% of our capacity to meet our box demand. And we just adjusted the output of our system. So I'm quite confident that we can slot this capacity in because it's a different product than we're making and it's a product we need. Chip Dillon : Understood. And last question. I know when we met with Tim when he became CFO last fall. Tim, you mentioned in New York you wanted to make buyback something that's something that has a certain cadence to it and certainly we've seen that in the last several quarters. And I guess Mark as we look ahead one sort of interesting track record a point that we could see IP achieve is if they raise the dividend again this year whether it's just a half penny a quarter or something. I think that would be the 10th year in a row. I go I've looked back as far as the 1930s I can't quite get back to 1898 but I don't think there were ever more than two years in a row where the company raised the dividend until this streak began nine years ago. And when I look around the marketplace and see certain stocks that have a track record you see certainly premium valuations. Is that something that you know is important to you as you think about you know capital allocation going forward having an annual increase of some sort. Mark Sutton : You know you mentioned the string here of annual increases, so that sort of speaks for itself. But what I would say is we recognized the role increasingly we recognize the role we play in different types of investors portfolio. So as a materials company we have investors that need and want short and medium term returns and you can do that with share buybacks and dividends. We have other investors that are willing to use us as part of their long-term return strategy and obviously in capital intensive industries. That's an element of our business. So I'm committed to balanced capital allocation and we're trying to show through our actions that we mean it. And so the dividend and the dividend improving overtime governed by Chip our target and guideline of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. So the reason we talk about free cash flow and the reason I'm excited about our ability to continue to generate $2 billion and continue to grow it is it allows us to meet the expectations of the type of investor that puts international paper in their portfolio. Chip Dillon : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Incorporated. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Two things, do you think that the white paper market has fully adjusted now to where it's going to be between roll and cut size. I'm trying to think about your own re-optimization given the opportunities that have come up. And with the higher prices that we're seeing, how are you thinking about imports not just in the stop gap period here but sort of over the next couple of years? Mark Sutton : Mark on the mix between the role various printing grades and cut size. You know we have a strategy and cut size it's a little bit different than some of the market and still believing that there's value in a branded continuum of products and we think that does play into our results so that's obviously an important part of it. It's difficult to predict the role side and the role printing side. Just general offset paper has had fits and starts with its decline rate. But I think right now we see some stability in the split between the printing paper roll side and the cut size side. Obviously, if you look at our asset base and what we have in North America in particular left focused on that business. They are great mills but there's only a few of them and they lean more toward the cut size sort of branded market. So I think you can see just by basis of what we have and what's happening in the market that's where we lean more. As far as imports, we obviously look at data around markets and best destinations and we factor all of that into the strategic part of our pricing kind of decisions. And we'll continue to do that. Mark Connelly : Okay. And just one quick question. You mentioned pulp export destocking. Do you have a view on where we are in that process and has it had a significant impact on your mix near term? That might be changing as we finish it up. Mark Sutton : So I think we are past the midpoint of destocking. If you look at inventory days on softwood pulp it is still high. They're higher than balance but they're not rising. And so I think the questions are going to be a combination of demand and other fiber choices how fast we can get back to an industry that's more balanced on inventory. Temporarily, that usually means for us if we took a hit in absorbent as I described because of some of our commercial decisions sometimes we feel that with non-absorbent softwood pulp. But it's not a material change in our mix. We're still working toward an 80% plus mix of absorbent to non-absorbent softwood fiber and we're still solidly in the mid to high 70s. So it's a few percentage points it's temporary and we'll be back on the track toward getting into the 80s based on some of the comments Tim made about the products we have some of the patents and the customer base is pretty rich as far as diversity of needs and parts of the world. Mark Connelly : Very helpful, Mark. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Steve Chercover, Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thanks, and good morning everyone. First one, hopefully it's easy. You used to provide us with your U.S. industrial packaging EBITDA margins. And I'm wondering if you had that handy for old time sake? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Something that Guillermo can follow up. I don't have it right in front of me, Steve. Steve Chercover : Okay. I'll do that. So getting a bit more needy. Obviously, you're running containerboard systems demand. How do you characterize your own inventory situation at present? And how long do you think it would take for the broader industry to get back into balance? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I think we're kind of where we would like to be in terms of inventory levels as we look at the demand that we had in the first quarter and what happened with the transportation network and we try to reference that in my comments earlier. But a big portion of the downtime that we took, which is just adjusting to the speed of the transportation network and how it's working now versus how it worked over the past few quarters. So I think we ended in the quarter roughly in line with where we think we need to be and probably we manage it week to week and month-to-month. Steve Chercover : Okay. And similar question on cellulous fibers. You took your first economic downturn in several years. So was that a function of the commercial decision you made or and also was the downtime anticipated in incorporated into your commentary at the end of January? Mark Sutton : So I think it's the two things that I talked about. The dislocation related to the commercial decision we made and the lack of timely replacement of that volume through the latter part of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, so the commercial decision. Plus we didn't see exactly the slowdown in China coming for these -- some of these types of products and that created a little bit additional to that. So in order to balance our overall profitability, customer service and costs, we decided to adjust the output of our system. And again, when you think about our system, that's the cellulose fibers comment but some of these mills were in the same fiber basket as our containerboard mills and even our printing paper mill. So we managed the inputs to those facilities enterprise-wide and we managed the output from those facilities, i.e., transportation enterprise-wide and then we look at the customer commitments we have. And we believe that the results you see the first quarter and the variable cost management is a combination of all of those decisions we made, which, in this case, resulted in some economic downtime in the cellulose fibers business, partly related to the two issues I talked about, partly to optimize our overall cost position in less than full operating environment. Steve Chercover : Yes, but I mean, I think you actually exceeded our expectations going from the bridge that Tim gives us for each of the segments. I guess you are managing that downtime in a very efficient fashion. Mark Sutton : Well, we worked very hard at it. It's a very analytical process with some automated tools. I've described it before. It's been a while since I've had to describe it, thankfully. But we've gotten better at it. And the team's really worked well across businesses to really optimize quickly the variabilization of a lot of our cost that sometimes can be sticky when you don't have a robust sales and operation planning process and the ability for your manufacturing and supply chain teams to have faith that they can make this change in an input based on the output of that mill and not get caught without something. And we're just continuing to get better at that and we challenge ourselves to operate like last year when everything was wide open and also operate top-notch when things aren't wide open. Steve Chercover : Thank you. Congratulations. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global Securities. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more color to understand the improved fixed cost absorption you're expecting to see in industrial packaging. And I'm sure part of it -- a lot of it relates to likely less economic downtime. And so I wanted to kind of, if we could parse through some of that. Tim, I think you talked about the transportation network and can you give us a sense as to how much downtime might have been related to that because presumably that is now done and we don't have to worry about it on a go-forward basis, is that fair? Tim Nicholls : Yes, Mark, it was roughly one-third of the total economic downtime that we took. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Great. And then would it also be fair to assume that a significant portion was also related to destocking in the export market? And if you maybe could give us color on the pulp business, where do you think we are in the destocking with export, and I realize there are moving factors with underlying demand, maybe changing a little bit but maybe more color on how much your exports were down in the first quarter and if it's reasonable, if you can give us a sense is for the full year, how much you would think your exports might be down? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I won't go into quantifying that since it varies region by region. What we see right now, and I called out some of this, Europe is still in the process and it's a combination of a weaker winter season, but we think a stronger spring season as we go into the new agricultural season in Europe. Latin America feels better, but there's still some inventory destocking that has to take place in Southeast Asia. So we see it moderating and flattening out in the second quarter and then recovering in the third and the fourth quarter is a general comment across all of our containerboard exports. Mark Sutton : The only thing I would add, Mark, is that Tim made a comment about Turkey, and that's an issue because some of the retaliatory tariffs. And I don't know -- no one knows if that's how much of a seasonal issue. It will get solid at some point. But we are a major supplier into that market for their kraftliner needs. We have box plants there, and it's a challenge right now. So that demand dislocation or the ability to ship there is looks like it's going to persist for a while until some of these other global trade issues get worked out on steel and aluminum and other things. So we'll just have to factor that into our output plans. Tim Nicholls : Yes. For sure. I mean, that is one of our largest export markets as a country. Mark Weintraub : All very helpful. And lastly, announcement by Clebin, I think it's last week. Any thoughts obviously, it would be the first large-scale eucalyptus base containerboard project. You're down in Brazil, you know the containerboard markets better than anybody. Any thoughts you would share with us? Mark Sutton : You know the Clebin I think information that came out is not new. It's been talked about for a while as part of this large fiber project they have. We don't make containerboard out of that fiber. We make printing papers out of that fiber, so we don't have any real-life information to share about whether how good is going to be or anything like that. But we'll learn what happens as they tried to bring that into the market it's a really short fiber, but boxes are engineered systems and sometimes you can use different products in different places in the box construction. We do that all the time with fiber makes, our Madrid mill have a laboratory for that different types of fibers and different layers. So we'll see. But to us it was just confirming what was already out there, just the numbers announcement had to be more specific. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Tim, one on the guidance, your second quarter guidance implies I think first half EBITDA will be flattish and then second half will be up about 100 just based on the full year. Can you just -- and I don't think maintenance will be any different year-on-year, 1H versus 2H. So can you just help me with some of the moving parts there, why you think they are your comparison will be much better in the second half than the first half? Is it better U.S. box volume? Is it something else? I'm just trying to understand that a bit better. Tim Nicholls : Yes. I think growth -- well, compared to what we think we're going to see in the first half, I think box volume will be better. I think we also are anticipating some of the destocking that we talked about in export containerboard, moderating in the second quarter and then beginning to grow again in the third and fourth quarter. On the pulp side, again, volume-related, we'll see a pickup in volume and a better mix of as we go through the third and fourth quarter that we've experienced in the first 2 quarters of the year. So some of the those things are what we're expecting to play out and with pretty good confidence that unless there's a dramatic shift in terms of the economic forecast we see and crop harvest and things like that, we think those are reasonable expectations. Adam Josephson : Thanks for that. And just on demand for either of you, just a two-part question. Can you give us your April box demand just in the first couple of weeks of the month if I missed that? And somewhat relatedly, just on the e-commerce. In late 2016 and throughout 2017, there was a surge in box demand and there was a great deal of discussion around the e-commerce benefit. And as demand has slowed in the last year or so, there's been discussion about a potential adverse impact from e-commerce as Amazon and others are looking to reduce their packaging. Can you just share your thoughts as to what you think the e-commerce impact has been in recent months and what you expect in the months to come along those lines? Tim Nicholls : So on e-commerce, we see it continuing to grow. There's a lot of things that get bigger over time. Growth rates tend to go down but we're still seeing, not only from our largest e-commerce customer, but we have a lot of others that are growing rapidly, too. So we're still very bullish on the e-commerce and where it goes in 2019. I mentioned without getting into specific numbers, I mentioned demand in April as seeing continuation for March into April, it's moderated a little bit as we've gotten further into the month, but I think we're expecting a similar type of destocking pattern against again, a very tough comp in March and a tough comp in April. Adam Josephson : And sorry, what was the March number, Tim? Tim Nicholls : We didn't publish the March number. Adam Josephson : Okay. Thank you. Tim Nicholls : Talking about why we're seeing across the industry in terms of box demand and ours was down. I'm not going to characterize what the number was for a specific month, but we did see weakness as we saw the weather-related events and the destocking that we think the plays across our customer base. Adam Josephson : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Mark Wilde : I wondered, first of all, just in light of the downtime in containerboard in the first quarter, can you give us just a rule of thumb in terms of how you think about the cost of downtime in your containerboard system right now? Mark Sutton : A rule of thumb for how we think about. Well, the rule of thumb is a percentage, and it's relatively split of our cost is true fixed cost in the short term. So we try to keep that at all times at an optimal level. And the rest of our cost, we view as variable innovative, even if it's not purely variable cost and we have, as I mentioned, on input -- of all inputs, wood, chemicals and everything else and an output of all transportation and supply chain to the customer, we have a supply chain operating model, SAP-based, lots of data visibility and our goal is to minimize all of that variable cost. And every time we have to go through a period of this type of operation, we've gotten a little bit better at variabilizing more of the cost. And our people and those systems continue to learn how to manage and it's about coordination, it's about not looking at it by containerboard or cellulose fibers or Printing Papers. It's about looking the fiber converters we have, making all three of those products, taking in wood, pushing out transportation and logistics cost and warehousing costs and using chemicals and other things and optimizing that for International Paper. And that's how we look at it. So that's our rule of thumb, not a specific number, but getting back to the smallest level it can be so that we have the best possible outcome when we're not running at sort of nameplate capacity. I would add though, Mark, running like we ran in 2018 with virtually maintenance outages and nothing else, it's not actually the optimal way to run our company or to supply our customers as a service platform they need. We'll do it when the market indicates we need to do it. But something like I talked about before, 3% to 3.5% of our productive time for maintenance, planned maintenance and about the same amount for flexibility in the supply chain marginal cost optimization, the ability not to buy expensive wood when we don't have to, that's where we make the highest level of profitability and have the highest margins. And that's not the first quarter, that's more than we would like to see, but that's why we work on that variabilization of our cost structure constantly. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's really helpful, Mark. For my follow up, I wondered if we could just talk briefly about Ilim. I'm mainly focused on this talk about potential containerboard project over there as well as what's your thinking right now in terms of your ownership position at Ilim. We've talked about this over the last few years about whether you want to take that position up and potentially be able to consolidate Ilim. Mark Sutton : So on the ownership position, it's 50-50 right now. We think that's the right answer for this point in time. We have good partners. It's working well. We have a strong shareholder agreement. We have our senior executives make up half of the board. So it's a very collaborative effort. And we think the 50-50, all in considering what's going on globally and everything is the right model for us right now. So we don't see a change in that in the near term. As far as the potential on containerboard, there's a market, 170 million people in Russia, the market is a good corrugated market, we participated in it in a small way. There's a little more we could do. And then there's some pockets of kraftliner demand that is theoretically anyway best served with Russian containerboard if you can get the supply chain figured out. There's part of China's fiber needs for brown virgin fiber that can feed in, that's also the best place to do that from is there. So we look at those unique markets to that cost structure and that asset base and really that fiber source is really what drives any interest in containerboard that goes outside of Russia. Mark Wilde : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Tim, just following up on Turkey. Is it possible to roughly quantify the size of your business there? And from an earnings perspective, is it accurate to say that this will hit both North American industrial packaging on the export side as well as the European industrial business? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Probably, to a lesser degree in terms of the business on the ground in Turkey and I would expect most of the detrimental impact to be in our export containerboard business. Turkey, in year's past -- it's ranged, but it's been anywhere from 100,000 tons to 200,000 tons. And it depends on the economic ambitions in Turkey and a number of other factors. So it's a big market for us. And given, as Mark said, the tariff structures that have been put on for one, but then secondly, just the underperformance of the economy there, it'll -- we'll work to overcome it. But it's a challenge in the near term. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. And then may be more broadly on Europe, you ramped Madrid, you made these recent box plant acquisitions, but obviously the market has had some issues from a demand perfective. How are you currently think about the timeline for achieving profitability in European packaging, understanding it's not the biggest part of your business, but... Mark Sutton : Well, our expectations on our European packaging business is we had, in the past, a very profitable business, above cost of capital returns. There's a couple of industry changes and a couple of IP changes that led to our profitability deteriorating and we have addressed most of those. So we fully expect that business to be profitable throughout as we exit this year and from then on. And we expect it to be a cost of capital returns. A big, big strategic gap for us. And it wasn't true 10 years ago, but it's true now, it's had basically zero in region integration on these cycled liners and we have that now and where we have that now you draw a circle around the middle and the Spanish box plant system, it's a very good business today. There's just other issues that we've got to finish fixing through our capability of the boxes we can make and the full integration of that mill. And I consider us technically integrated on most of our kraftliner from our U.S. mill systems. There's just a supply chain step called a shipping channel between the production and the usage. But to me, it's an integrated output for 30% to 40% of our fiber needs there. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the operating performance. A couple of questions. First, in terms of pulp markets, its recognizing that your business is obviously, much more oriented to fluff and different than other business that we would see in the fibers market. There's been this standoff between buyers and sellers, particularly in Asia going back to the fourth quarter that in turn has led to inventories at the producer level rising, and we've talked about this on this call that you're now working those down. And buyers inventories being worked down. Where would you say your customer's inventories are, both in terms of the consolidated cellulose fibers business and also Ilim as we stand here today? Are customer's inventories relative normal at this juncture, Mark? And relatedly on pulp, you mentioned there were some downtick in demand that caught your operations a little bit by surprise. From my understanding, tissue has remained relatively stable in China from the day that's grown 5%. So what ticked down that led to the downtime? And then I had a follow-up on containerboard. Mark Sutton : Along the overall inventory question, I wasn't clear to me whether you were talking about hardwood or softwood inventory. I think hardwood inventories are where the standoff is. I think primarily the bleach eucalyptus pulp coming from Latin America is a big input to China. That's what's been publicized that I've seen that there is a \"standoff\" between the producers and the users. On the softwood, we don't make that. But on the softwood side, again, as we said, 75% to 80% of our mix in the North American business is absorbent pulp. And that has a number of demand drivers. One of them is obviously, the economic health of the population in the GDP per capita and how many people can move into those types of products like disposable baby diapers. And if that changes because the economy changes that are with you just have a slower adoption rate and that's what we've seen. In other markets, we've seen the ability of a poor economic environment to actually have people stop the frequency at which they use some of those products, which then shows up in a lower growth rate. The rest of the softwood goes to the number of different users who would see softwood in, some towel and some packaging and we're not a major player for North America in that. That's really the Ilim story. And I don't have a number for Ilim's customer inventories, we just look at what everybody looks at which is the industry inventory numbers and they're north of I think 40 days and that's a high number for that particular product line. I think the perfect world balance for customers and suppliers is in the 28 to 30-day range. So I mean kind of new assumption on demand and assumption on production and you can figure out how soon it gets back to a more what if it would be historically normal. George Staphos : Okay. But I mean, Mark I know you don't make hardwood per se, Mark, but using analogy for cellulose. Your fluff business and from what you can see your customers inventories on that side are relatively still high, but working lower, would that be fair? And Ilim, you wouldn't have a view on that. Would that be a fair recognizing it's tough to get at inventory data in China for the other customer side. Mark Sutton : I didn't understand analogy you\u2019re making so yes, I think the way you stated, high not as high as that analogy, at the high end working off and high basically, because of the dislocations in demand that I described, primarily in China. And a little bit in the Middle East. But that they thought they were going to sell more finished product then they did, there's more fluff pulp in the system but not at the levels that your analogy on hardwood craft. And on Ilim I think Ilim looks more like the general softwood market, but I don't have on customer inventory levels handy. George Staphos : Totally fair. Appreciate the thought. I want to come back to you're saying earlier about maintaining 3% to 3.5% flexibility in the system. The way perhaps you needed to run in prior years because of all of demand for containerboard led to not necessarily how you like to optimize the system on a going-forward basis. To maintain that flexibility, I could think of a couple of ways that, that might change how you prosecute your commercial strategy over time. Do you think -- what would you be able to relate us in terms of how that changes how you run the business commercial in containerboard differently than maybe years in the past? Thanks, and good luck on the quarter. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. That's a fairly involved question, But I would just say at a high-level overtime, not in the quarter, not even in a particular year, just if you want optimize a business like this, then we believe somewhere in the range of what I talked about is what's necessary to keep your operation safe and reliable and then to keep your supply chain and your customers happy which leads to better value propositions, better margins, just better position for the customers if you have a great product and you have great service. And so that comes out to roughly about 6% I talked about. For the second 3%, it's about continuing to invest in our system. Some of these boring projects that we talked about something like head boxes and all, what it does it makes three mills able to make the same basis rate range and the same quality, which allows us to optimize the way we run. Everything doesn't have to be running wide open at the same time. And the other way to do it is challenging our teams through Six Sigma and best-in-class lean manufacturing techniques to improve productivity. And so that we can do more with what we have that then build a cost structure that is not requiring 100% nameplate output to make at least return. You have it as a reserve capacity like a public utility does and you don't use it and you don't put input cost, you don't put people against it when you don't need it. And I would say there's a human element to this, too. When you run like we ran last year, you wear everything out. You wear the equipment out and you wear the people out. And that's not a small issue in our company because we want to run a safe company where people are engaged and they're not completely running a sprint all the time. There's an element of running a nice race over time and so reliability, best practices in manufacturing and doing those kinds of things, building system flexibility and duplicity so we can make some decisions around the 16 containerboard mills we have, all leads to being able to have that flexibility time in terms of machine hours without it being a big cost. And I believe when we look at periods where we've had, that's where we produced the best margins, the best -- you don't know it but we know it, the best customer satisfaction and allowed us to grow our position because we can meet every need the customer had. George Staphos : It gives you a more predictable system and probably an ability to have a more predictable customer base with longer-term contracts. But we'll turn that over at this juncture. Thanks again for taking the time. Mark Sutton : Thank you, George. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner, Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Good morning. Tim. Good morning, Mark. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Scott Gaffner : Tim, I just wanted to go back to the export market for a minute. You said the inventory destocking was as expected but then when you were talking about the guidance you talk about some additional weakness. So 2 things. One, are you seeing a little bit weaker in market demand in the export market in addition to the destocking? And then two, when you look at the visibility to the export markets, I mean, how do you get comfort around your visibility? Is most of your sales there direct to customers? Or you're going through distribution? Just any color you can give us will be great. Tim Nicholls : Question. Most of it is direct. So we do talk to our customers and we get their view. I think the part that we didn't fully anticipate in terms of underlying demand with some of the seasonal crop weaknesses that I mentioned earlier. Europe is more of the issue as I laid out in some of the prepared comments. Europe is going to take a little bit longer. We see recovery starting in other regions of the world, some are better than others, but almost all of them are better than Europe. So there's a little bit more weakness there in the first quarter. But again, talking to customers, we expect that to moderate as we go through the second quarter. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And as far as the full year forecast on export, it sounded like you were mentioning that just you expected recovery in the second half but you don't expect recovery back to 2018 levels, did I hear that, right? Tim Nicholls : Right. It's going to be down versus last year, but it will start ramping back from the first half numbers as we get in the third and fourth quarter. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And just one last one here, I know we're late in the call. But Mark, when we look at be monthly data for the industry, whether it's box shipments, supply-demand, et cetera, a lot of other industries like retail and auto have really gotten away from this idea of having monthly sales data. Obviously, IP is the leader in this industry and that itself caused significant volatility in the shares 1Q and has historically. Is there any thoughts to why or why not you or the industry wouldn't go away from providing data on a monthly basis? Mark Sutton : It's a good question, Scott. Honestly, I haven't talked about it that much. Some of the data comes from aggregation of industry trade associations and it's a question worth considering. I really haven't given it a whole lot of thought. I know that the -- some of the retail industries have gotten away from that, some of them are still in it with same-store sales and those things that tend to cause overreaction. I think it's something we\u2019ll think about. Scott Gaffner : Okay. Fair enough. Looks forward to talking about in the future. Operator : And our last question for today will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two-parter on M&A. One public company multiple has come down a lot over the last year and obviously, the macro environment and even some of the business-specific outlook has become a little bit more muddled and uncertain. So just thinking how you kind of balance those two? And how you view M&A today versus how you view it a year ago in terms of your overall capital allocation strategy? And sort of the related question there is obviously, do the DS Smith investment package. I wonder if you could comment on what that might bring to the table? What that might give you that you didn't already have? And any expected EBITDA from that in 2019 and whether that would be included in the guidance at this point or not? Mark Sutton : So on general question about M&A. It is true that sometimes valuations come down in periods where companies might not be prepared to do M&A. The way we think about it is it has to be a strategic fit, first and foremost and obviously, timing does matter. But if you're talking about public companies, a temporary valuation change usually doesn't win the day because Boards of Directors look at the value of the company over the past 12 months and all kinds of other valuation formulas. Right now, we really like the company we have. We have more run rate in the company we have today as we talked about in terms of our strategy is to improve International Paper. It's very possible and has proven to be true in the past that some M&A has helped out and it probably will in the future, but it's not a burning platform for us because we built a really good company, really since the transformation plan coming out of '05 and '06 and we're trying to bring this company to its full potential. So it's always a potential tool or a tool in a strategic toolbox to improve a company, but value creation, good returns, above our cost of capital and earnings growth leading to free cash flow growth is what we really want to focus on. And as I mentioned in my comments about our investor base that we have today and the investor base that we recruit, we recognize the balance capital allocation is a role that a company like International Paper needs to play, short, medium and long-term capital returns, and that's going to be remain a focus. Brian Maguire : And just on the DS Smith business in particular? Mark Sutton : Thank you for reminding me of that. DS Smith business. Well, it does two things. It's relatively small in the big scheme of things. But for the European business, it will have a meaningful impact. The Portugal plant is right in the backyard of the Madrid mill and it's so -- it's about capability and integration. And the other couple of plants that came with that, a little bit of integration, but also some high print capability that we lack in France and in the general Mediterranean regions and so this was a way for us to accomplish something that was already in our strategic list and doing it as an output from a sort of European antitrust type of sale, you're able to be made fair acquisition, addressed two of our strategic needs at a pretty good value. We haven't had time to factor in that into our forecast this year, but I would view that as upside. Brian Maguire : Okay. Last one for me, Mark, a lot of discussion about demand and the weakness in 1Q and obviously some of that is tied to macro uncertainty. In your view, sitting here today, do you think that if we get trade deal with China, which has been rumored for a long time, that's going to lead to an acceleration in box shipments, both in the U.S. and the export markets? That could be a meaningful catalyst for getting us back on track to closer to 2018 levels? Or do you think looking at the end markets that you got a lot of food and beverage, it really won't show up that much on the numbers? Mark Sutton : I actually think it's more likely to show up in the numbers than not. The China, I think we're learning every time there's a disruption with China, how much of a role it plays in the global economy. I think the uncertainty around on the margin, a lot of our U.S. customers for packaging, export a portion of their output whether it's food or other materials to China. It's not a big part of their business, but it's a meaningful part and it's disrupted to some extent due to tariffs and other things. When you add all that up, it's a U.S. box produced for an export product to China. It shows up as softness in U.S. demand but it really has nothing to do with the U.S. It has everything to do with them or that they can get to their product, marginal amount of their product to a market that's currently slowing down, number one, and number two, in some cases, has some additional tariffs applied to the products. I think it helps take some of the uncertainty in the economy away. And that typically, when you look at the drivers of box demand, the consumer components of GDP, nondurable production, those things tend to get better. And I think when we had a less uncertain environment with China, go back into early 2018 and 2017, we had better macroeconomic numbers that drive box demand. So I don't have any information to say that, that wouldn't return if we took the uncertainty off the table. Brian Maguire : Got it. Appreciate the insight. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, again for joining our first quarter earnings call. As always, Michelle and I will be available for follow up questions. Thank you. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today's International Paper Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Mollie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining International Paper's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investment, Slide 2 also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining our call today. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in the second quarter. Our performance again demonstrates the strength of International Paper to generate strong cash flows and take full advantage of our system flexibility to deliver solid results in a more challenging environment. Taking a look at demand in North America. Our box shipments improved seasonally in the second quarter but were weaker than we expected with sluggish demand in a few of our nondurable and durable goods segments. Uneven global demand and continued customer destocking affected our containerboard and pulp volume in the second quarter. Operational performance was strong and we managed costs well across our businesses while executing our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. Through the first half of the year, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $810 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Continuing with the second quarter performance on Slide 4. Revenue was down about 3% year-over-year, largely due to the impact of the lower price and volume for export containerboard and pulp. We operated well in the quarter and controlled cost effectively to deliver $948 million of EBITDA and continued strong margins. Our equity earnings were $80 million in the quarter, which includes $67 million from our Ilim joint venture and $13 million from our investment in Graphic Packaging. Free cash flow was $732 million in the second quarter, and this does include cash dividend of $239 million from our Ilim joint venture. I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover performance across our business sectors and our third quarter outlook. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Great. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 5, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. As Mark said, we delivered solid earnings in the second quarter while navigating through a more challenging environment. Price and mix decreased mainly due to lower prices for containerboard and pulp, which was partially offset by increased prices in our North American papers business. Volume increased on seasonally stronger demand in our North American packaging and Latin American papers businesses, which was partially offset by lower export containerboard volume. Operations and cost performance was strong. Our mills performed well in our heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year and we executed downtime efficiently. Input costs were favorable with lower fiber and energy cost across our businesses. I'd note that wood costs were favorable quarter-over-quarter after a steep run-up in 2018 and early 2019 due to severe wet conditions in the Southern U.S. Corporate and interest expenses were favorable and taxes were as expected at about 25% effective tax rate in the quarter. Lastly, equity earnings were $0.09 lower sequentially, which include the $0.03 quarter-over-quarter drag from the noncash FX impact on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt. I'll now turn to the segment starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. Our business performed well against an uneven demand backdrop. Price and mix were favorable mostly due to lower export pricing, which was partially offset by improved margins in our European packaging business. Volume in our North American box business improved seasonally, but as Mark mentioned, we saw weaker-than-expected demand in the second quarter. I'll provide a little color on that in just a few minutes. In general, export containerboard volume was also weak with inventory destocking and lower demand in the Middle East and Asia. Operations and cost performance was strong. We ran well, we managed costs effectively to mitigate the impact of downtime in the quarter. Our performance again demonstrates the strength of our system and our ability to flex production to efficiently meet our customers' needs. We also completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year, and we now completed about 80% of planned outages for the year. Taking a look at input cost. Wood, recovered fiber and energy were favorable versus the prior quarter and softwood inventory normalized in the second quarter as we expected. On Slide 7, I'd like to come back to the North American corrugated packaging ban and take a closer look at what we're seeing from our customers. Demand in e-commerce and protein segments was strong. E-commerce continues to grow at double-digit rates as we work closely with our customers to optimize packaging design to meet their specific supply chain needs. Protein, mostly pork, chicken and beef is benefiting from shifting consumer preferences as well as increased export demand. And fresh produce demand has normalized after the late start to the season. Processed food is a large category with many consumer segments. But broadly speaking, demand was softer in the first half of the year. This is in large part due to a drawdown of finished goods inventories for food manufacturers which have trended down since late 2018. We expect customer inventory to normalize as the third quarter progresses, which should lead to improved demand for boxes.  Nondurables, excluding food and beverage, represents about 30% of the U.S. box demand. This is a wide-ranging category with many consumer and industrial products such as agriculture chemicals, resins, plastics, rubber products, paper and printing, towels and tissue and textiles and apparel. Again, a large category for which underlying box demand is closely tied to nondurable manufacturing activity, which has been soft in the first half of the year. The weak demand we've seen does have some secular elements such as printing and writing and environmental concerns for plastic consumption. However, the broader weakness is driven by high finished goods inventory since we exited 2018 and lower exports due to weaker global demand and ongoing trade tensions. We do anticipate improved demand as the year progresses and nondurable manufacturing recouples with the strength in personal consumption. Taking a look at durable goods. Box demand has lagged the general economy through the first half of the year. This segment includes building materials, furniture and other products for which demand is closely tied to housing starts, which has trailed the strength of the broader U.S. economy in the first half of the year. So no doubt, our box demand has been softer than we expected coming into 2019. When we look at the underlying drivers of box demand, there is a disconnect between otherwise healthy consumption, expenditures for nondurable goods and demand for corrugated packaging that we believe is largely rooted in finished goods inventory levels which continue to unwind. Stepping back for a moment, we are confident that secular drivers such as sustainability, e-commerce and consumer preferences will continue to drive healthy growth for corrugated packaging over the long term. More importantly, International Paper is well positioned. We have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a material way, and we apply our vast network of packaging design and innovation expertise to understand and exceed our customers' needs. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. The effect of price and mix lowered earnings by $32 million in the second quarter due to continued trade and tariff uncertainty and persistently high inventory levels. Given that this business mostly serves export markets, today's trade uncertainty certainly weigh on us. Taking a look at underlying demand, we continue to see growth in softwood and absorbent pulp even as trade and inventory destocking pressures supply/demand dynamics. Operations were strong and we managed our cost well. We did have a $10 million insurance recovery in the second quarter related to Hurricane Florence last September. We executed our high maintenance outage quarter well and have completed 80% of our planned outages for the year, and input cost improved $10 million on lower softwood and energy costs. On Slide 9, I'll turn to Printing Papers. Our North American cut size business performed well. We're ramping up shipments with new customers, and realization of previous price increases are following through as expected. Our roll business is more challenging due to weaker commercial printing demand and increased imports. Taking a look at underlying demand for uncoated free sheet in North America. Through June, demand was down about 3%, which is in line with our view of about 3.5% secular decline. In Brazil, we had stronger seasonal volume and cut size as expected, however, demand for offset was weak due to delays in the government textbook program, which started in June but was about 3 months later than the normal start. Overall, the business performed well and we executed the heaviest planned outage quarter of the year. Looking at Ilim on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered solid commercial and operational performance in the second quarter with EBITDA of $222 million and EBITDA margins of 40%. EBITDA was sequentially lower driven primarily by lower average pulp prices and higher planned maintenance outage expense in the quarter. Equity earnings were $67 million and benefited from a noncash foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $7 million or about $0.02 per share in the quarter. Now in terms of the outlook on Slide 11. Overall, we expect lower price and mix, improved seasonal volume and export shipments, lower planned maintenance outages and lower input cost. Now I'll take you through the changes business by business. So let's start with Industrial Packaging where we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $110 million on the impact of prior year index movement in North America and export pressure. Volume is expected to improve by $20 million on seasonally stronger demand in North America and improved export volume. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million due to higher seasonal labor cost in our North American box system. And also within Industrial Packaging, lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $68 million while input costs are expected to improve by $10 million on lower fiber and energy costs. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $45 million. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $20 million due to the non-repeat of the second quarter insurance recovery and higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $52 million and input costs are expected to improve by $5 million on lower wood costs.  Shifting to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to lower earnings by $20 million, mostly related to export pressure in Latin America and geographic mix. As an offset to this, volume is expected to improve $20 million on seasonally stronger demand in North America and Brazil and lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by $33 million. To recap, planned maintenance outages, as expected, we completed about 75% of our outages during the first half of the year. Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix. And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture, which includes $10 million higher maintenance outage expense versus the second quarter. If we look at the full year on Slide 12. On the demand side, we entered the seasonally stronger second half of the year in our North American packaging business. We're also seeing improved shipments for containerboard exports to all major regions as inventory destocking progresses and underlying demand improves. In Global Cellulose Fibers, underlying demand for bleached softwood kraft and absorbent pulp is growing. However, we continue to see a difficult environment as we enter the second half of the year due to trade uncertainties and high industry inventory levels. And our paper business is performing well. We're ramping up cut size business with new customers and for the full year expect to see benefits of recent price increases in North America. Outside of North America, we are seeing increased pressure in export markets and our Latin American business. Against this backdrop, our revised forecast includes the impact of prior index moves in North American packaging as well as the impact of lower realized prices for export containerboard and for our pulp business. For the full year, we're projecting EBITDA of $3.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. Our outlook demonstrates International Paper's strong and resilient free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, we've returned $810 million to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. You can expect that we will use cash for debt repayment and returns to shareholders in keeping with our principle of maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade rating. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim, for the details on the quarter and the outlook, particularly given all the moving parts. The way I'd summarize where we are today is our businesses are well positioned and we're operating very well. But clearly, what the market is presenting to us at the current time has lots of ripples to it. There's no question we're operating in a more challenging environment this year relative to 2018. Through the first half, International Paper has been able to navigate very well, delivering results better than might be expected in this environment, including a strong level of free cash flow generation, and this didn't occur by happenstance. Instead, our results are the product of the work we've done to improve our portfolio, we've established advantaged positions with low-cost flexible manufacturing systems and we have a laser focus on customers. As we enter the second half of the year and face continuing challenges, we are well positioned to navigate through them as we work on further improving our company. Our focus is on the free cash flow generation, which is the basis of shareholder value creation. Our expectation for free cash flow generation is strong at $1.9 billion. This enables us to further improve our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. I'm confident that the company we build will allow us to succeed in practically any set of conditions at any point in time. I think about International Paper's future often. And given our company's longevity, sometimes my view of our future is prompted by an important event from the past. The Apollo 11 lunar landing 50th anniversary media coverage that we've seen over the past week is an example of this. I remember watching the live TV coverage on July 20, 1969, on my eighth birthday. We were leaving that day on a family vacation, but we were all glued to our black and white television watching. What I didn't know at the time and only learned recently was that IP had an important connection to that broadcast. 2 weeks prior to the mission, the sole sponsor on CBS reduced its support, and International Paper stepped in to sponsor 1/3 of the live broadcast on the lunar landing and moonwalk day. 50 years ago, we could not dream of using the phone in our pocket to honor almost anything and have it safely to our homes in a corrugated box. Disposable diapers were just beginning to gain traction with consumers and have led to other absorbent products that make people's lives better. Just imagine the role renewable, sustainable fiber-based products will play in the future. For International Paper, the products, ideas and services we provide to our customers in more than 80 countries around the globe truly make a difference in people's lives every day. As a company, we've had many milestones during our 120-year history to be proud of, but I'm just excited about the ones that are ahead of us. As the world continues to change, and we know it will, International Paper remains resilient and committed to improving people's lives, the planet and our company's performance. So with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research. Clyde Dillon : The first question I have is if you could just talk a little bit about how the conversion at Ash [ph] in Alabama is going -- at Riverdale, I should say, at that mill and how you see that start up. And then as we look at CapEx for 2020, I know it's early days, but directionally, do you see it going higher or lower than the $1.4 billion you're guiding to this year? And actually, I hate to keep piling on there, but you did lower the EBITDA guide from -- by about $350 million from last quarter, but the free cash flow is only going down $100 million. And so maybe you could help us understand that change, especially since you're not changing the CapEx guidance for this year. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. So just on the free cash flow, a couple of things changed as we lowered the guidance. First of all, we were expecting a bigger recovery of working capital and also lower taxes for that matter. So we had some headroom in the $2 billion that we had talked about. We had never quantified that, but we feel good at a real solid $1.9 billion on cash flow. On capital for next year, all of that work is underway at this point and so we're still in the planning stage, and we have typically given that guidance as we report fourth quarter earnings in January, and I expect that'll continue to be our cadence. But I don't see it being higher. We had some big projects over the past couple of years that have pushed the number up a little bit, so I don't see it being higher. The degree to how much lower it will be, we're looking at right now, and we can give you more on that early next year. And then I'll just give you my perspective -- turn it over to Mark, I know that he will want to talk about Riverdale, but I think it's going extremely well. We're still on track. Everything's coming together from my standpoint, the way we expected it to, on the conversion. Mark Sutton : I would echo what Tim said. We are well down the path of final engineering work. Preconstruction is on plan. The project's being executed very safely. Obviously, we have additional workforce on the project of this size. So, so far, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making and the schedule that we're on. On the comment on CapEx, Chip, I'd just take you back to the big picture on what we said long term about CapEx is. We look at our capital allocation based off of our EBITDA and hence, the cash from operations and that, that CapEx tended to be around half of that cash from operations to reinvest in today's cash flows, and its facilities we have today, to take structural cost down, to meet any environmental regulations and then occasionally, to make some strategic investments like the Riverdale project or the Madrid mill. And so that at a high level how we think about it. And the balance of that cash then goes back through share repurchases and the dividend. So we don't see a big change in those relative ratios of where we move the cash that we generate from operations. Clyde Dillon : Okay. Very helpful. And a quick follow-up. We're -- we've been reading about Amazon making some changes to their packaging requirements or requests, and I'd say at least half the boxes I get from Amazon have your logo on the box. I do look. I get funny looks from my wife and others when I'm -- that's the first thing I look for on the box. But how do you see that impacting both the company and the industry, sort of some of these moves to streamline packaging with e-commerce? Mark Sutton : I think the big picture is e-commerce is growing at a rapid rate as a way of doing commerce for consumers, so that's the first thing. And corrugated plays a really important role in a lot of those supply chain solutions. We've said oftentimes that the packaging environment in e-commerce is built for speed through the supply chain right now, not packaging optimization. But packaging optimization is coming. And the good thing is, not only with that particular company but with most of the major e-commerce players, we are at the table and have a very strong position and are helping them to design. We think the right size and the right type of packaging and the sustainable approach is the right answer for the market. We're not afraid of the changes that occur. The overall segment is going to continue to grow and corrugated is going to play a really important role. And we have the ability to help our customers as they're ready to make changes in the packaging design so that they keep the speed to the supply chain, which the consumer wants, 1-day delivery and so forth, and reduce waste and reduce overpackaging over time. And we have a lot of design capability to do that. So we see it as complementary to what we offer. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : In containerboard export markets, I think you indicated customers are destocking inventories and demand is maybe improving or expected to improve. Just wondering if you could sort of reconcile that with the price erosion that we've seen in July? And then do you see stabilization or maybe some inflection in export market prices? And then I think last quarter, you provided some detail on where you thought export customer inventories were by sort of global region. I think Europe in particular was quite elevated. Wonder if you could just sort of update that as well. Timothy Nicholls : Anthony, it's Tim. Yes, the fundamentals seem to be improving more or less as we expected. If you remember last quarter, we had said we think it's going to take a little bit longer and it did. But now we see that starting to turn. If you remember, the agriculture season in Europe was particularly weak last year. This year, it's much stronger. So I think people stocked up more -- for more containerboard than what they ultimately needed, but the strength of the season earlier in the spring and now the big season coming up looks to be very good. Those inventories seem to be -- have been worked through and people are coming back to the market. So I think Europe's improving. Latin America is continuing to be strong. Asia was a little bit weaker, but not to the degree that the European -- region-wise. In terms of price, I mean when you get to this point in a cycle, there's a lot of fluidity. But I guess rather than trying to forecast price, which we wouldn't do, we just say we see fundamentals improving and customers returning to place orders and begin building for this upcoming season, which will be late third quarter or fourth. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then the detail that you've given on corrugated demand trends by end market is very helpful. When you talk about other nondurables, I think you said that demand might be impacted by secular trends and you mentioned the decline in print, which I think is understandable, but you also talked about I think environmental concerns around plastic consumption. Just wanted to get any more detail on that comment. Are you actually seeing lower shipments of certain plastic products or is that more of a general comment? Just wanted to follow up on that. Timothy Nicholls : I think it's more of a general comment. I mean what we would have, we'd probably have to characterize it as anecdotal at this point. But the trend seems to be there from a social standpoint. So probably to a greater degree in Europe where it's getting a lot of air time, but we usually follow Europe on a lot of these trends. And so I think the environmental concerns are starting to pick up, and we'll see what patterns develop over the next few quarters. Mark Sutton : I think Anthony, the purpose of Tim taking us through that detail was trying to get some perspective from International Paper on what we see through the eyes of our customers in the box market, largely the domestic U.S. box market. And to answer the question or give some perspective on the question, why is demand where it is in 2019 versus what we saw in 2018, and obviously, we know there's a very strong correlation between nondurable manufacturing to the manufacturing to nondurable goods in the U.S. and box demand. And when you dig into that detail, and we serve customers in every one of those segments and Tim ran through some of those, what our customers are seeing is softer demand for their products for certain reasons but no major conclusions on that. Some of it, we believe, for example, the agricultural chemicals example that Tim gave, is really about the amount of rain and flooding and the delayed planting seasons that have occurred in the Midwest. So those products are delayed in their shipping, and some of them may get skipped this year because of the lack of ability to plant in the flooded plains. But that's not demand destruction, that's just life happening. So that was the purpose of that, to give some color around what might explain what we're seeing as a major provider of these products through the eyes of our customers. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Inc. Mark Connelly : Two things. First, Mark, when you think all about the work that you and your customers are doing on supply chains, do you think there is a shift in the amount of inventory that constitutes healthy? We're at 3.8 weeks, and is that the right level or does it need to go lower? And have you changed the way you think about the relationship between inventories and price stability? Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Mark. I think the -- what we've seen is when there's ample logistics and transportation velocity in our own company and our customer supply chain, we see the ability to operate with significantly lower inventories. Last year is an example where the problems in the rail and truck and ship transportation lanes actually caused inventories to go up, partially to compensate for that. That's loosened up a bit now. So I think part of what we're learning -- industrial companies are learning is that the variables aren't fixed anymore and you have tightness in transportation, how fast things flow through that you didn't have in the past, a wide variability on that. And part of it is self-inflicted with U.S. rail companies implementing their scheduled changes, and some of it's just supply and demand in the trucking industry that may never completely be where it used to be. So higher inventories are necessary when the velocity is slower, and lower inventories are possible. So that's going to take a while to figure out what condition are you in and how do you think about inventories and pricing because I don't think it's a single number anymore. I don't think it's this many weeks. It's this many weeks against this backdrop in the supply chain. Mark Connelly : That's helpful. And one other question. We've clearly seen fluff prices move more closely with commodity pulp prices than they used to. Do you think that's simply the new relationship? Or is that just a function of all the supply and demand disruptions we've been having lately? Mark Sutton : I think it's the latter, best guess we can look at based on our experience and customers. There's always a certain amount of flexible capacity that can make qualified fluff products or make market pulp, whenever the economics are better and certain parts of the market move in and out. I think China's change in demand and their overall fiber influence on the world is still sorting itself out. So I don't think anything's fundamentally changed other than the softwood fiber market is a little bit disconnected right now, and there are some -- maybe some temporary unnatural flows. And so that has created a little bit more dynamics around specialty fluff -- fluff and specialty pulps that are kind of the top of the pyramid and the more general market grades. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Just to follow on some of the earlier questions on inventory. Just obviously, you took a lot of economic downtime in containerboard and a little bit in the fibers in the quarter. Just wonder if you could kind of characterize where your own inventories were at the end of the quarter and whether you think you'll still need to take some downtime in 3Q to get them back to normal. Or were they in a pretty good spot? Timothy Nicholls : Well, Brian, it's Tim. We don't disclose what level our inventories are at. Specifically, I would say that at containerboard, we're running our system as we always do. We typically run a very lean supply chain. Disruptions with transportation can cause it to fluctuate a little bit, but we don't like to carry any more inventory than we have to or to serve our customers' needs. I'd say pulp inventories, as you've seen, systematic around the world, are a little bit higher and ours were a little bit higher too. So -- but within line of -- in 1 mill or 2, slightly higher inventory is what we would like to have over some period of time but within a reasonable range in total. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then just on volume growth trends in corrugated, actually, the box shipments were -- because you noted down 2.1% in the quarter, a little bit weaker than you're expecting. But it sounds like the outlook for the middle of the year, back half of the year, I think most of what I've been hearing has been pretty optimistic. Just wondering if you can comment on anything you're seeing so far in July, if there's a way to quantify any kind of pickup you're seeing and any specific end markets you're seeing some strength in. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. The comments that we made were focused on the second half where we do expect to see pickup. July has been soft. We came out of June, and it's continued more or less in line with how we exited the quarter. But it's one of the slowest seasonal months of the year. It has the holidays at the beginning of the month. And so our expectation is that we get into the seasonally stronger periods. In third and fourth quarter, we will see the pickup that we're expecting. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : On the customer destocking, would you say we're pretty much at the end of that now or are we still seeing a little bit more of it? And would you be willing to hazard a guess as to the magnitude of impact that might have had on the box business in the first half of the year? Timothy Nicholls : It's Tim. Let me just start with export, and I think that's where we are seeing a turn. One thing that we did mention earlier, and this is not so much an inventory question, but it is a demand question, the reversal of tariffs into Turkey, which is a large kraftliner containerboard market and a big one for us that we had essentially pulled out of in large ways, has had an immediate effect. The day after tariffs were lowered, we were getting calls for orders. So I think in the export markets, the destocking is running its course and nearing its end on the back of a really strong agricultural season, especially in Europe and some of the tariff relaxation around Turkey has definitely been helpful. On the -- it's a little bit harder to gauge on the box side, and Mark may want to provide some color here. But you're dealing customer by customer with what they're telling you about their position and their demand levels. And so it's anecdotal and it's looking across a lot of customers segment by segment. And it's our best read from the conversations that we're having -- that we've had that a lot of the destocking had seemed to work its way through, and it will depend on demand levels in the second half and then an increase in nondurables manufacturing activities. Mark Sutton : I think the key sign is going to be, and we see it in some of the subsegments, not in all of them, but when we start to see order pick up, that means the nondurable manufacturing is picking up. And again, there's a lot of segments in there. We see the pickup in some. We don't see -- I mean I think in one of the examples I gave around the chemicals related to crop planting, that's a gap that's going to be hard to recover because the season is passing us by. It's just one example where we don't expect a quick turnaround. But we are seeing positive order pickup in some of the other segments, which means those products are now being manufactured again. Mark Weintraub : I really appreciate you highlighting the export side first because actually, just mathematically, the decline in export has had a bigger impact on containerboard demand than what we've seen domestically. So just focusing back in on that, are you suggesting that perhaps, as we get things rebounding, we could get the export business back to where it had been? Or do you think it ends up being somewhere between the quite low levels in the first half of this year and the very strong levels we saw last year? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I think for our business and the customer base that we're serving, we think we can get back. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Edlain Rodriguez, UBS. Edlain Rodriguez : Just one quick one on the printing paper market. Like what's your outlook in the -- on the market in the medium -- no, near to medium term? And also, why do you think it was like so difficult for the industry to hold on into the price increases in uncoated free sheet? And could they have done something better to manage supply/demand and pricing? Mark Sutton : Edlain, this is Mark. I think overall, we don't see a whole lot of change in the Printing Papers business. We're a large producer in the North American market and in the Latin American market. We don't see a major change in the overall long-term demand trend. There are some ups and downs in that secular decline. And when you have these kinds of issues, when you're raising prices in one region and demand might be slower, for example, in Brazil with their economic challenges, you will then see some products move around. So you got a little bit of imports coming into the U.S. We always expect that depending on economics in other places. And I think all that factors into how pricing flows through and how resilient it is. But we see the business as -- in secular decline but stable and we're operating very well. We've actually improved our position with key customers. And inside of -- grades, like cut size, we've actually grown in the market based on the customers we've aligned ourselves with. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wondered if you could just help us with how you think about the economic downtime. If you look at the first half, you took nearly 0.75 million tons. And I wondered, is that coming through just flowbacks? Or have you taken some smaller machines out? And I also wondered if there's a point here where you think about just like indefinitely idling a given mill. Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Mark. So on the how we do it, we look at our system as a system, and it produces many different grades and types of containerboard based on box design requirements. So they're not all alike or each mill, each unit operation isn't exactly like. So it's a combination of -- and all of our mills have a throttle on them. That's not on, off, so we can run fast, slow, faster than fast like we did last year and we can shut down. And we use all of those tools depending on the marginal cost algorithm that I talked about quite often and whether or not we can combine it with some other things that we need to do, whether or not we can lower our transportation cost, wood cost, take advantage of recovered fiber versus virgin. All of that goes into a marginal cost algorithm that allows us to look over our 16 mills, look over our order book for the coming month or two and then decide with enough time to shed the cost, what to run and at what output level. A lot of it is just running less than full output and balancing to maximize our energy production in the integrated mills and so forth. The second part of your question is hypothetical in the sense that we have the system we need. It's very low cost, it's very capable. And we believe the box market long term and the containerboard market globally is growing. So our view is we have the right capacity in the right places. For today, we don't make those kind of a strategic decisions in 1 year or 1 quarter. We had it for today and we had it for the future, and we feel real good about that. We really worked hard to build a system that, as you can see from the results, can do really, really well in a year like 2018 where we were probably running beyond our capacity and a year like 2019 where we're needing less than 100% of it for a period of time and we've adapted very, very well to it. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then for my final one, I just wondered, Tim, if you can talk about the second quarter Ilim dividend. And I guess what I'm wondering is, a, was a dividend of this magnitude in your planning for kind of free cash flow estimates for the year? And then secondly, does the size of this dividend tell us anything about sort of timing and cadence on the capital projects that have been talked about for Ilim? Timothy Nicholls : No, I don't think it impacts any of their plans strategically about the types of projects that they're planning. The business is throwing off a lot of cash. So this was just a way of returning it to the investors in the joint venture. We did have it in our -- I think we even talked about it. I can't be 100% sure. I didn't go back and look. But I think we alluded to it on the first quarter call that we knew we were getting it. We had just not received it at that point and then it came through during the quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : The first question is really more a point of clarification. And I just want to make sure that I heard it directly. If we go to Slide 11, which is your outlook slide, the operations and costs delta sequentially for Industrial Packaging, was that a $1-5 million negative or a $5-0 million negative? I thought I heard $1-5 million, which in turn would mean that EBITDA, you're forecasting flat sequentially. But if you could provide just some commentary there and remedial math, I guess, that would be helpful, and then I have a bigger picture question. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. So George, you're talking about the seasonal labor cost? Just to make sure I heard you correctly. Mark Sutton : No, the option cost. George Staphos : The option cost, that delta that you cited. Timothy Nicholls : It's $1-5 million and driven mostly by seasonal labor cost in the box system. George Staphos : Okay. So then we're looking more or less flat sequentially in EBITDA 3Q versus 2Q, that would be fair? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. George Staphos : Okay. The bigger picture question, and this in part piggybacks on the question that Mark just teed up, recognizing that you don't make decisions on your mill system quarter-over-quarter and you're obviously doing extremely well running the business this year in a choppier demand environment. Is there a practical limit that arise, I don't think you'll give me the timing of that here, in terms of the running to demand? Or can you run to demand as long as you need without any kind of impact on labor, your mill footprint, obviously capacity coming on? When would you have to make some changes? Or would there be a point where you'd have to look at your mill footprint and see what you do from a running demand standpoint? And then the related question, I guess at one point in time, obviously in the last couple of years, you looked at expanding geographically. How would you guide us in terms of your latest thoughts on that? Would cycle timing and macroeconomic play into that? If you can remind us where would that be independent of how you would use that or view that as an opportunity going forward? Mark Sutton : Okay. That's a lot, George. I'll just... George Staphos : Last in the line here, so I had to get it all in there. Mark Sutton : No. It's good. That's a very good use of one question and one follow-up. On how long can you run, look, we talked about it before at a high level. We think we -- our system runs best when we take about 3% of our available capacity out on a scheduled basis to maintain our assets and then about another 3% for flexibility in order to serve because we're making boxes with this stuff. It's a short-cycle business. You need to be able to turn on a dime sometimes. And so running wide open, except when you're down for maintenance, usually results in higher costs and disappointed customers. So if you take 3% and 3%, and you say -- if we run 94% over time strategically, we're at our best. But could we run lower than that for a period of time? And I won't define the periods, you're right, absolutely. And then as we put more technology in our mills, as we put more sensors and we have more predictive maintenance, I think we'll change the equation on that again. And so the labor piece is important but for a different reason than you're probably asking. It is a cost, but we view our labor as a true asset. These are technically trained people that run and maintain our equipment. And so we do everything we can to keep them fully engaged -- paced and fully engaged, whether we're running like last year at a 100-plus percent of our capacity or whether we're running like this year at something less than that because that's a particular part of our value proposition that's really difficult to replace. So we can run at a flexible level for quite some time. But just to give you the high-level way we'd think about it, flexibility, maintenance and then really using our people and our marginal cost algorithm to make the best decisions we can. On the strategic question about expansion, I think every major element of how we would make a decision, including cycle time and the macro conditions, factors into it. But strategic decisions like you're referring to are really about opportunities to create value over the long term by increasing International Paper's intrinsic value. And so if it's an acquisition, then it should be clear that it has strong synergies and a strong return and a complementary industrial logic. If it's organic, strong return and the ability to -- obviously, it's not -- doesn't have the same risk profile, but the ability to generate strong returns immediately with the investment. So the cycle time is important obviously because it affects sentiment, it affects your balance sheet, it affects your cash flow. But I would say all of that is in consideration whenever we contemplate that type of action. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson. Steven Chercover : So it's good to hear that e-commerce will continue to be a source of growth, both short and long term, and I had just a couple of questions on that. As we think about the Riverdale whitetop project, was this done in anticipation or maybe in consultation with your e-commerce clients so that products can be placed in high graphic boxes that can also be robust enough for shipping? Mark Sutton : I think in general, it -- the need for that type of high-quality printable liner was definitely developed in consultation with lots of customers, not just e-commerce. Steven Chercover : Okay. And make sure it's related on e-commerce. To the extent that some of the smaller packaging might go to pouches, I don't think that plastic is the answer. So are you working on anything that might involve kraft paper? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. We work on almost everything that is fiber related for our customers. And we actually have products that are already in the marketplace that are using essentially what you would refer to as kraft-type paper. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Tim, just back to the box demand commentary for a moment. Just to make -- so I understand it better, so in the first half, it was weaker than you expected, I guess partly because of weather, partly because of economy, partly because of finished goods inventory destocking. In terms of the latter part, how do you know -- what kind of visibility do you have into your customers' inventory levels because I thought they only kept a few days of a box inventory on hand? So I don't understand how they would be reducing their inventories throughout the first half of the year and then suddenly build it up in the second half. So can you just help me with how much of the first half shortfall was attributable to each of those factors and then why exactly you think there will be an inventory restocking in the second half? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. It's a great question, Adam. I wasn't really referring to their inventories of our product. I was referring to the consumer products that they're making and workings through their own supply chains. So that's really the commentary about destocking as we look at our set of consumer products oriented customer base. And parsing it out and quantifying each one though, I mean it's a variety of those factors where the business is looking at it segment by segment and customer by customer and understanding all of the movements for the 10,000-plus customers that we have, but it's all of the things that you mentioned. Adam Josephson : Got it. And just on OCC, Tim or Mark, I think you've been of the view in years past that OCC costs were biased up out over the long term. Obviously, we're sitting here at 25-year lows and they're not -- OCC prices don't appear to be moving anytime soon. And obviously, what China is doing is playing a major role in that. Do you have any reason to think that OCC is going to go up much from here? And if it doesn't, what impact do you think that will have on the domestic supply/demand situation, considering how much of the new capacity has been of the recycled variety, not only domestically but also in other markets? Mark Sutton : Adam, that's a great question. It's a strategic question. You're right, we had -- have and had the long-term view that if you just look at fiber balances around the world where the growing markets are -- tend to need to use recovered paper as their fiber source and the producing regions of the world that are making that virgin fiber that becomes recovered fiber are slower growing. We don't see a major change in that. I think China's position on recovered paper has definitely created a dislocation. The question is how long it lasts. But our long-term strategic view is fiber-based products, especially packaging, are going to continue to grow, which would lend itself to a demand for recovered paper over time. The supply of recovered paper is virgin paper. So if -- in any scenario you can think of, it results in the world taking out virgin paper. In a few months, you've just taken out recovered paper because one is apparent than the other. So I think if you look at the way the system works together, it may take longer and it may not be the time line we had been discussing earlier. But we think over time, the two types of fiber, original tree fiber and its recovered sibling, are going to work hand-in-hand. There'll be some temporary dislocation. What I want is in excess supply, but if the way you solve that is by reducing the original supply, it corrects itself pretty quick. Operator : Our last question for today will come from the line of Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo Securities. Gabrial Hajde : Two quick ones for you. One is, I guess pricing mechanisms are a little more opaque in the cellulose fibers business. And given sort of the decline that we've seen since late 2018, can you talk about how that might flow through? I mean you gave us third quarter obviously, but maybe thoughts on 2020 in terms of how these price declines that we see on this may impact the business. And then maybe bigger picture, appreciating that the long-term growth for those types of products is something in the 2% to 4% range, how do you think that business trajectory could be to get to that $600 million EBITDA figure that you guys had been targeting prior to some of the, I'll call, global malaise? Mark Sutton : Yes. We're not going to try to project the 2020 pricing, but the growth rate is accurate, what you've talked about in that 2% to 4% range. And we think that this year is the disconnect for the industry and also for our company specifically. But we don't see any reason why with that growth rate and the role that these products play for the consumer, products companies that are making them, that we can't get on that -- back on that trajectory. It's just going to take a little bit longer. Gabrial Hajde : I'm sorry, Mark. I was more referencing just changes in price that we've already seen, how that plays through from a contractual standpoint given, again, some of the discounting factors that occur as well as timing lags? Mark Sutton : So the contract pricing is customer by customer, and some of what you've seen in the marketplace doesn't always affect that. And then the balance of the customers that are using indexes -- and it's not as predominant as you would see on the containerboard the side of the indexes, the pricing driver for the discussion. So it's a bit of a different market. And again, not -- I'm not going to pin July or this year, try to forecast what effects, from what has already happened, it's going to have in 2020. It's not appropriate to do that. Gabrial Hajde : Okay. And then the last question revolves around an initiative by one of the large e-commerce providers to charge folks back for not being qualified for frustration-free packaging or what have you. I think takes effect in a few days. Is it your view -- or have you -- I'm assuming the answer is yes. But maybe elaborate on any magnitude of dialogue that you had with your customers to respond to that. Or do you think that's something that is still on the come when it actually goes into effect and starts to hit people's wallet? Mark Sutton : I think it's going to be a little bit of both. I think that the amount of products that were designed, the packaging was designed for a retail display, probably isn't capable of navigating the supply chain for e-commerce direct to someone's house. So that packaging will change, and that we see more likely to change more toward the corrugated or micro-corrugated side and we see some benefit there. But I think people got it figured out. There's some tooling costs and there's some design changes, and then the supply chain is complicated. Can you make a product and put it in your package and guarantee that it's going in one supply chain, i.e., e-commerce versus the retail channel? That's not as easy to do for some companies as it sounds. So it will take a while to work through this. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you again for joining International Paper's Second Quarter Earnings Call. As always, Michele and I will be available for your follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating on today's Second Quarter 2019 International Paper Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our third quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim JV and Graphic Packaging investment, slide two also provides context around those financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide three. International Paper continues to deliver solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow. Our results again demonstrate the strength and resilience of our cash generation and the flexibility of our company to navigate well in a challenging environment. Demand in the quarter was mixed. North America packaging improved seasonally, largely as we had expected. However, export containerboard and pulp shipments faced pressure from continued supply/demand imbalance. Operational performance was strong. We took full advantage of our manufacturing and supply chain expertise and managed cost well in our three businesses. Taking a look at our cash. Through the first three quarters, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow and returned nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we also used $400 million for debt repayment. Earlier this month, we increased our dividend for a 10th consecutive year, reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and a brief update on our portfolio. Yesterday we announced the completion of the sale of our controlling interest in the papers business in India. We are now passive investors with minority ownership of a company which we intend to fully exit. I want to thank our team in India for their dedication and wish them well in the future. Continuing with our third quarter performance on slide four, we leverage the flexibility of our system, operated well and controlled costs to deliver $1 billion of EBITDA and margins of 18% in the third quarter. Revenue was down 6% year-over-year due to the impact of lower pricing in our packaging and pub businesses, especially in our export channels. Our equity earnings were $27 million, which includes $18 million from our Ilim joint venture and about $10 million from Graphic Packaging. Ilim equity earnings were largely as expected and they reflect the impact of lower softwood pulp prices into China. Free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at nearly $600 million. Through the third quarter, we have generated free cash flow per share of $4.43, compared to just under $4 per share for the full year in 2018. Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Great. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide five, which shows our quarter-over-quarter operating earnings per share bridge. Price/mix was a headwind mostly due to the impact of prior index movements in North American packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers, as well as the flow-through of lower prices for export containerboard. Volume improved modestly in the third quarter, driven by higher seasonal demand in North American packaging, as well as improved containerboard exports. This was partially offset by lower seasonal demand in our European packaging business. Operations and cost performance was strong. We continue to optimize our mill and converting networks as we match our production to our customers' needs. We did experience $10 million of additional costs in the quarter related to Hurricane Dorian, mostly in our cellulose fibers business. Maintenance outage costs were favorable, and input costs were better due to lower fiber costs across our businesses and geographies. Corporate expense and taxes were higher in the third quarter with an effective tax rate of 27% compared to 25% in the previous quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to the federal tax provision after finalizing our 2018 tax return. I'll now turn to the segments and start with Industrial Packaging on slide 6. Our business performed well and the North American business earned $525 million with margins of nearly 23%. Across the segment, price and mix was unfavorable, mostly on the impact of prior index movements in North America, and realization of lower export containerboard pricing. Volume was flat. Improved volume in North American packaging and containerboard exports was offset by seasonally slower demand in Europe as well as weaker demand in our packaging business in Turkey. In North America, box demand improved seasonally. We had strong double-digit year-on-year growth in e-commerce and the protein segment continues to perform well. Process food improved modestly, but beverage, nondurables and durables remain weak. In October, we've seen a slight pickup in demand. Overall, we're confident in our commercial outlook and the trajectory of our growth as we move into the coming year. The segments we serve, our customer portfolio and recent business wins add to our confidence. Containerboard export shipments also improved in the third quarter, although a bit less than we expected. Underlying demand was actually pretty good, but customer inventories took longer to draw down. Operational performance was strong. We leveraged the flexibility of our system and control costs effectively to mitigate the impact of economic downtime in the quarter as we adjusted production to meet our customers' needs. And finally, wood and recovered fiber costs were favorable versus the prior quarter. I'd like to come back to containerboard exports for just a moment on slide 7 and give you a regional view on how we see things shaping up. Underlying demand has improved throughout the year generally as we expected, while inventories took about a quarter longer to normalize than we anticipated and have pressured shipments through the first three quarters. Summarizing the regional dynamics. In Latin America, more favorable weather conditions are contributing to better crop harvest for bananas and other agricultural products that require kraftliner to go to market. In Europe, customer inventories took essentially three quarters to normalize while demand improved modestly. Shifting to Asia. In China, demand remains sluggish as tariff uncertainties linger. And in other regions in Asia, demand is mixed, although customer inventories are back to normal levels. The takeaway here is that we expect export containerboard shipments to continue to recover, and we are seeing this in October. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on slide 8. Third quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions, which was partially offset by better mix on improved fluff pulp shipments. Volume improved by $4 million, also driven by improved fluff pulp shipments in the quarter. Supply/demand conditions remain challenging. And although we see better customer demand, overall industry inventory levels remain high and trade and tariff uncertainties continue to weigh on China demand. Against this backdrop, we continue to focus on optimizing our system and controlling costs. We ran well and successfully mitigated some of the impact of Hurricane Dorian in the quarter. Operations and cost also includes the impact of economic downtime as we adjusted production to meet our customers' demand. Input costs improved by $6 million. Printing Papers on slide 9. Overall, the business performed well and delivered earnings of $162 million in the quarter. Across the segment, price and mix decreased mostly due to lower pricing for exports from our Latin American and European Papers businesses. Volume was essentially flat. The seasonal demand pickup in Latin America was a bit less than we anticipated, and lower volume in India fully offset increases in other regions. In our North American business, we had strong performance in cut size as we continue to ramp up new customer business. However, performance in the roll business was weak due to challenging conditions in commercial printing. In Latin America, supply and demand conditions are challenging as we enter the fourth quarter due to pressure from pressure from imports, especially from Asia. In North America, underlying demand is decreasing within our expected range of 3% to 4% annually, while the level of imports decreased in the quarter. Operational performance was very strong. We ran well and controlled the cost across the system. In North America, we also benefited from a favorable LIFO inventory revaluation of about $10 million. And input cost improved on lower hardwood cost in North America. On Slide 10, the Ilim joint venture delivered operating EBITDA of $113 million and an EBITDA margin of 24% before foreign currency charges. Earnings were impacted by lower export pulp prices as well as the completion of the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year, which also affected volume in the quarter. Equity earnings were $18 million and were impacted by a non-cash foreign charge on Ilim's U.S. dollars denominated net debt, of which IP's portion was $4 million in the quarter. So, let's turn to the outlook on Slide 11. I'll start with Industrial Packaging where we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $45 million on the impact of prior year index movement in North America and export price flow-through as well as the negative mix impact of export volume recovery. Volume is expected to improve by expected to improve by $25 million on improved demand in North America and continued export containerboard recovery. Operations in costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million due mostly to non-repeats of positive items in the third quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging, lower maintenance outage expense is expected to improve earnings by about $45 million and input costs are expected to remain stable. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $30 million on the impact of prior index movement. Overall, volume is expected to be stable with higher fluff volume offset by lower market pulp. Operations and costs are expected to be flat sequentially with the non-repeat of the hurricane impact being offset by higher seasonal energy cost and inputs are expected to remain stable. Moving to Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to lower earnings by $25 million, mostly in our North American and Latin American businesses. Volume is expected to improve by $20 million on stronger seasonal demand in North America and Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $40 million related to the higher seasonal energy consumption across our papers portfolio as well as the non-repeat of LIFO benefits in the third quarter. And input costs are expected to improve by $10 million on lower fiber cost in North America and Brazil. Lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for the Ilim joint venture. Slide 12 summarizes our full year outlook. As we continue to perform well in uneven global environment, our focus is on free cash flow generation and executing our framework for capital allocation. For the full year, we expect EBITDA of $3.8 billion and we expect free cash flow to be $2 billion. On capital allocation, through the third quarter, we've returned about on $1.1 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases and we've used another $400 million to strengthen our balance sheet. And earlier this month, we also increased our dividend. Looking ahead, you can expect our capital as allocation choices to be consistent with our framework. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Tim for covering the details on the quarter and for the outlook. As I always do at the end of our call, I'd like to just close with a few thoughts about the company and quarter. Our solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in the third quarter, I think, again, demonstrates that we built a really resilient company that can perform well in just about any environment. And while the U.S. economy remains healthy, we've been managing through some inventory headwinds and broader trade tension that are impacting our exports. That said, our focus at International Paper is to execute well and maximize results in any environment. For us, that means being relentless about our pursuit of long-term value creation for our shareowners by focusing on free cash generation and executing our capital allocation strategy with that free cash flow. And for our businesses, that means managing well what we can control, exceeding our customers expectations and strengthening our value proposition, making sure we optimize the full value chain and running our manufacturing network well and leveraging the strength and flexibility of our mill and converting systems. When we put all of this together, we perform well and generate very strong free cash flow. Our free cash flow per share is up year-over-year. Our strong execution in the company's LIBOR allows us to raise our full year 2019 free cash flow year 2019 free cash flow outlook to $2 billion. We had unique capabilities to drive to just about any challenge we may face. Most importantly, we have the people, the innovation, the products and a low-cost high quality system to succeed with fantastic customers. And with that, we are ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Wilde, BMO Capital markets. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning Mark, good morning Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Timothy Nicholls : Good morning. Mark Wilde : Mark, just kind of staying on the free cash flow theme, I wondered, if you are in a position to give us any thoughts on the sort of CapEx as we move into kind of 2020 and kind of wrapped up with that. What do you think the proper kind of maintenance CapEx is for IP kind of across the cycle? I think you're about 70 to 80 of maintenance capital for this year? Timothy Nicholls : Hey, Mark, its Tim. It's a good question. We are still -- we're getting close, but are still finalizing what 2020 is going to look like and we'll report that out when we release fourth quarter earnings. Question on maintenance capital, depending on the schedules, these are big pieces of equipment that have different time lines. So are always looking to make sure that we are being balanced by what an asset needs, but also recognizing that there is flexibility in timing. And we're always looking at how we can do it for less money in terms of outage schedules, how we use contractors, how we use our own labor. So it can go up and down, but there is some flexibility there that we can realize over time. Mark Sutton : So I would just add to what Tim said, Mark. One of the objectives we shoot for on the whole maintenance subject and as we look at that is protecting today's cash flows and making them sustainable, there's the CapEx piece, but there's also the expense piece. And what we try to do is make sure we use our resources effectively, so we lower the total cost of maintenance. And it's all cash, and we try to lower the total cost. So if the CapEx solution can solve a recurring maintenance expense issue, it's probably the right thing to do to go ahead and eliminate that issue. So we really do look at it holistically. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then just to follow-on, Mark. You did call out an overhead reduction of about $20 million and I don't recall having heard about that initiative before. So perhaps you could give us a little color on that and what the trajectory might look going forward? Timothy Nicholls : Yes, it's Tim again, Mark. I\u2019d just say its kind of normal practice. We had some charges last year due to restructuring. We're always looking at how we deploy across the organization for what we need to run the business and try to get better and do it at a lower cost with better processes. So there's initiatives underway. We don't promoted them. We don't talk about them broadly, but its just continues improvement and trying to make sure that we don't spend any money that we don't need to. So that's really the charge in the third quarter. And the charges in the third quarter, because we know where there is going to be impact, the savings from that charge will play out over a series of quarters as we implement. Mark Wilde : Very good. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly, Stephens Incorporated. Mark Connelly : Your price cost performance in the containerboard was excellent again, despite all the down time. Is there any reason you would change the way you manage that downtime if we have to continue at the sort of levels? I'm just wondering if there's things that you do that work in the short run, but that you don't want to do longer term to keep those level of performance so high? Mark Sutton : That's a great question, Mark. I think the way we try to look at it on the output of our system, especially containerboard given its so large, as we look at things that are structural versus cyclical, and obviously, if you that there are structural changes in the amount of containerboard, we needed to supply all of our box customers and open market customers, then you probably do some things differently. But right now, we believe we built the system, through the last few years by integrating warehouse and integrated temporary then kind of normalizing our capability at the mills and taking a real focused view on marginal cost that we have lack of a better term, we have a throttle on the company We can run wide open, we can run less than wide open, and we can shed certain types of costs and variabilize a lot of things that used to look fixed. So for us its whatever we believe about the near term and long term growth and the fundamentals in the industry and right now we see what's happening right now is mostly cyclical, not structural. Mark Connelly : Okay. The performance there has really been excellent and the throttling effect is clearly massively different than what you've been able to do historically. My second question is a simple one. You are dealing pretty well with the challenges in the pulp market. Are you seeing any difference in the way customers are thinking about contract terms in terms of pass-throughs or anything else? Mark Sutton : I think there\u2019s always some discussion on how the commercial arrangements are constructed. When you\u2019re in the moment of the excess pulp supply, sometimes customers do want to revisit the way contracts are structured. Usually the conversation goes to a normalized period and not just a cyclical high or low. So there's always discussions on that, Mark. And I am able to say one thing. What we're seeing in the targeted markets we have, which is the absorbent products, it really is becoming very customer-specific and what type of economics, they're looking for based on their go-to-market strategy for that baby diapers and the other products. And they\u2019re not all the same and years ago I use to see much more of a similar approach or desire by most customers. But we are seeing it segment into unique commercial types of conditions. Mark Connelly : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Hey, Tim, hey, Mark, I thought I heard you mention during your prepared remarks that there were some recent win, I think you mentioned related to the containerboard business. If you could comment a bit more in detail, if there's something that we should keep in mind there and relatedly, I think you said your business is up modestly in October. But if you provide a bit more color about what you're seeing in the containerboard, especially domestically and then I had a follow on. Tim Nicholls : Yes, George, it's Tim. It's actually speaking to our box business for were constantly working with customers about innovative solutions and how we address their needs and there is a cadence to these things. They don't neatly follow quarters, even multiple quarter sometimes, but we've been very active this year on -- with our commercial team, talking with customers in some cases, existing, and some cases new. And a number of wins that we've had for the box business that will start coming through over the next few quarters. So that was what I was relating to in the prepared comments. We feel really good about the teams win so far. George Staphos : Okay. And just related point. How are you doing in July did you say \u2013 July and October? Tim Nicholls : Well, July, I can tell you about that. October was a little bit better. We don't have a clear view on shipments. We have a clear view on what we're processing through our facilities, and so, when we close the month we\u2019ll see how much of that flow directly to customers versus preparing inventories for seasonal demand, especially around e-commerce. But yes, we saw a slight uptick in demand for October and feel good about it. We think it's going to be a good season for the fourth quarter. George Staphos : Okay. And related question, I'll turn it over. The wins that you\u2019re seeing is there any kind of common denominator in terms of what IP is offering that might be somewhat different than what's being offered in the market? We tend not to hear so much from IP on how your narrowing systems and machinery with your corrugated business, is there any benefit that you\u2019re getting there? Can you just give us a bit more color in terms of why you're winning this business recognizing it doesn\u2019t always come in smoothly? And how sustainable that is going forward? Thank you, guys. Tim Nicholls : Yes, thank you, George. We do because of our size and where we service customers, we do some of everything, and we do most of them in a very big way, so yes, machinery and yes, all types of innovative solutions. Innovative solutions are really important customer by customer for what they need, not for creating something that tried to go sell across the entire space. Mark Sutton : I think just to add on that George, the approach we're taking with the large segment that tend to be the faster-growing segment like e-commerce, like protein, some of the things that IP has build over time, our scale and our reliability as a supplier and then bringing some innovation on top of that has allowed us to grow our position with customers that we already have a very large position with and we try to earn at that every single day, every interaction. And I would give a lot of credit, maybe it's not differentiated. I can\u2019t speak for other companies. I would give a lot of credit to the IP people that served these customers. We have employees that are embedded with some of our customers, helping them solve the problems, helping them run package at faster rates. And I think that really works well for us, when we bring the full skills of IP to our customers. When I made my prepared remarks, I said something about leveraging and optimizing the entire value chain, and this is what we mean by doing that. It's not just the product, but it\u2019s how we provide the service and how we give even some of our Human Resources to our customer, our manufacturing team, for example, even go out and help customers in their manufacturing operation if it's applicable. George Staphos : Very good. It\u2019s very solid quarter. Thank you, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover, D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to actually focus on the specialty cellulose business. So first of all, can you just remind us what you thought the mid-cycle earnings or EBITDA potential of the segment was post Weyerhaeuser? Mark Sutton : So I think what we said on our few quarters ago that we believe that that business had a $600 million EBITDA potential, and we still believe that. We are in a period right now of some disturbances in the softwood pulp market and absorbent pulp is not immune to that. It affects both the pricing and also affects demand. So we believe that, that still an achievable objective. I'll remind you though, Steve, one of the things we stated as a strategy is to have our business at about 85% of our capacity focused on absorbent pulp. So fluff pulp in the specialty grades that are kind of a bubble for fluff pulp and the product continue. We're only about 74% right now. So are making some products, market pulp products and other products that they're not long-term products for us given the North American fiber and cost structure. And the only place we really plan to make nonabsorbent pulp is in our mill in Canada, which makes a high-quality northern softwood. So we got a pretty clear strategic path. We've lost a little bit of time given this kind of softwood supply issue of time given this kind of softwood supply issue globally and the commercial things we talked about globally and the commercial things we talked about from last year. But we are very convinced that this is going to give International Paper the right growth profile. It's a great product line, the types of things that go into, and we believe he can get the business to that point. It's just going to take us all bit of time. Steve Chercover : Okay. Thanks for the detail there. And I'm not trying to change dramatically -- it looks like we're going to start 2020 from a pretty low point. So I'm wondering are there anything -- any plan you have to do in place to improve results? And are you still being impacted by the commercial slow power or whatever you want to call it that impacted you earlier this year? Mark Sutton : So the exit rate of 2019, you're right, will put us in a challenging position. And yes, we have commercial initiatives. The good news is we're commercial initiatives. The good news is we're commercial initiatives. The good news is we're beginning to see commercial wins in the targeted customers and grades we want to make and which is the absorbent products, and that will start to come to fruition as we go into 2020. And then there is a lot of opportunity on the cost structure. We have -- essentially we two 2 we have 2 businesses. We have the Weyerhaeuser business we acquired, which is doing very well. It was built for purpose pulp mills. And then we have the IT legacy part of that business, which is largely mills converted from other usage and not yet optimized. And there's still the ability to optimize several of those facilities and get out total cost down. So combination of commercial success, cost and then operating in this environment of supply and demand where pricing returns to more normalized level, all of that should come to fruition. The question is just, how long does it take on the market based stuff? The other things we control and we'll begin working on that as we go forward. Steve Chercover : Thanks. Hopefully you'll count that as one pump question. I just wanted to ask about the Italian antitrust fine. Is this another situation where you chose to settle as opposed to litigate and are there other folks who were also impacted? Thanks. Tim Nicholls : No. It's Tim, Steve. We were acetifying, we're appealing that decision, and so we're recognizing the charge in the moment while we go through the build process. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe, your line is open. I'm going to go to the next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Anthony Pettinari, Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. One of your competitors recently called out the capital investment to increase their OCC processing capacity. And I'm wondering for your North American system, are there opportunities to shift from virgin to recycled, given what looks like this potentially a structure lower OCC prize. And then maybe if you could just remind us what your system mix is between virgin and recycled? Mark Sutton : Anthony, the system mix is roughly 35% recycled fiber. We have -- what we look at is the actual fiber cost through the system to where you actually form that sheet of paper. So we call that fiber to the head box because there's other cost involved. For example, you want to make sure your maximize your energy production in the integrated mills, even if you're blending and recycling fiber. So if look at some of the investments we made over the last few years, we've increased our capacity at 100% recycled mills, and we've increased our capacity at some of our virgin mills that used certain amount of recycled fiber. So we have the ability to do more. But we look at more than just the cost of OCC. It really is the cost of the fiber to the forming part of the equipment that really matters because if you leave more OCC, and it causes you to generate less boiler fuel to make your biomass energy, you have not done anything on your cost. So that's how we look at it. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. No, it's very helpful. And then maybe a related question, pulp and paper recently introduced the recycle liner index. Do you anticipate any commercial impact from this index? And do you the index makes sense? I mean, it seems kraftliner has a pretty standard basis way. Recycled line seems lot that they used to may be quality differences, your thoughts on that? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Anthony, it's Tim. Our belief is the box market is pretty competitive and the market's pretty efficient. And so knowledge -- there's not any new knowledge that's being created here. It's just being represented different way. So I can't speculate on what will happen. It's not hard to tell, see how it plays out. But in one sense, we don't see this as a significant change that's been put in the market. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub, Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. And I'm trying to tiptoe into what's a complicated question. So I realize it may be hard to really answer in this context. But you've mentioned your view on footprint that you look to see whether there are structural changes on the containerboard side to guide your actions, which makes perfect sense. And I guess, one of the things that's been very now exposed, the fall off in demand has really been more weighted to the export business and domestic business. So if kind of focusing on the export business, how confident are you that, that bounces back? And I guess, the two things -- the two variables that play, which maybe great to get your perspective on is, you have the slide where you showed China demand has been pretty weak, which given that they are importing so much less OCC has been somewhat fledgling even recognizing that maybe their economy slower. And then the second part being, you know, there is a reasonably large amount of capacity that's being started up outside of North America. How much of that is the issue for the export business versus what's obviously, again, in a weak macro situation overseas? Mark Sutton : So you're right. That's a complex question or set of questions, Mark. But I think taking it up a level, the view that we have on containerboard is informed by the view we have on corrugated packaging growth globally. And the role that what we do export kraftliner plays in that, and we still see growth in boxes globally as a preferred method of packaging and we'll see were sustainability and all this discussion to go. But we think it bodes well for fiber-based packaging, which then feeds into a kraftliner growth rate. We used to think it was 3.5%, its probably somewhere in that neighborhood. But for right now, we've seen a demand decline, and we saw inventories built last year. And when you put the two together we have a correction in the year of 2019. We haven't seen any structural that changes the ultimate driver of the containerboard demand which is box demand. And the fact that kraftliner plays a very important technical role or reality role, which is it is the feedstock for the global recovered fiber market. So they really work together, and we still believe and see the future is very bright in corrugated packaging, which informs our view of our containerboard business. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And just \u2013 I did \u2013 did you give a specific indication on the EPS expectation for this year? I think I may have misheard but did you actually give a number there? Or did I miss here? Tim Nicholls : We did not. Mark Weintraub : Okay. I am sorry. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry, about that gentlemen. My question was on the Riverdale conversion down in Selma, and I was trying to maybe see if you could frame up for us the impact to first half of next year. If I recall back the Riegelwood in 2016, I think it caught some of us by surprise the magnitude of differential between taking the mill down and doing the work and then when it ramps back up. I don't know if there's any context you can give us around that. Tim Nicholls : No. It will be a pretty long outage. There's a lot of work to be done, when we take it down and start making the conversion. I think it's premature to lay that out at this point. We are finalizing what that all looks like next year. I'm sure we'll be able to give some general indications as we report on fourth quarter. But at some point papers will -- the production of Printing Papers will shut down on the machine and then all of the preparations for -- we tried to do as much work on ancillary equipment ahead of time. So that work is done, construction work, but then on the machine itself and related parts of the back-end of the mill, that work will begin early in the first quarter as we've outlined, and so we can give you more insight on that as we report fourth quarter. Gabe Hajde : Okay. Thank you, Tim. And one more, I guess, focusing on the conversion. I've read some pieces different places that the capacity conversion may be more net neutral to capacity, which seemingly imply a shuttering somewhere else. And I was curious \u2013 you guys have taken a pretty decent amount of economic downtime this year, how you're thinking about your network and your needs as you see, commercial winds and the corrugated downstream business and what you might need elsewhere in the organization? Tim Nicholls : Yes. So, Gabe, you may be thinking about is how it relates to white-top liner, but not the system overall. So we run our system based on our customers' needs. So that's where we start from. But this will be incremental available productive capacity. What it's actually going to free up is other facilities that they're currently producing this product to produce other products. One of which has a large position in gypsum facing board and will now be able to grow that position. So, it won't all show up in containerboard necessarily, but gypsum facing board or gypsum facing paper is something that we've been in that market for a long time. We have great customers. We think we provide good products and good service and we really would like to grow that position over time. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Mark Sutton : Hi, Adam. Adam Josephson : Mark, just one on your box demand on the quarter is \u2013 call it flat in the quarter. If memory serves, on the last call you talked about your thought that your customers had little down their finished goods inventories quite considerably, and I think you expected somewhat of a pick up in the second half as a result of that. So, did you see that? I'm just trying to square that with the flattish demand and relatedly you talked about e-commerce continuing to grow at double-digit and I'm also trying to square that with flattish demand in the quarter? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. So, Adam, we did not see, to your point, we didn't see to the extent that we thought we would. We did see it in e-commerce. We feel really good about e-commerce. On protein side, we saw good performance. Process food, as I mentioned, was slightly better but not as much as a pick up as we thought it would be. And then some of the other segments, other non-durables, beverage and the like, did not come through the way we expected it to. But we also had in terms of some of these consolidation plays that have happened across the industry, we've had some business lost due to those that happened at the moment in time and then the replacement volume for that comes through on a longer time line, but that's what I was referring to with these customer wins. We feel good about the commercial activity in the quarter that will show up in the coming quarters. Adam Josephson : I appreciate that, Tim. And then just one also on e-commerce, I'm just trying to connect the e-commerce growth with total market growth. So back in 2016 and 2017, obviously, everyone was talking about e-commerce. It was growing double-digit. Box demand was up 2% but it happened to coincide with the economy really, taking up. And now you're still talking about e-commerce growing at double-digit, but you're demand is flat. So I'm just trying to \u2013 what do you think the relationship is between your e-commerce growth for the market e-commerce growth in total, box demand growth given the relationship this year seems to have delinked, if you will? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, I think it's appearing to be delinked only because we've had some of these losses that I talked about that kind of creates noise in the number. I think you're going to see that reverse itself over the next couple of three quarters. So I don't think anything structurally has changed. Mark Sutton : I think, Adam, we talked about the box demand kind of trailing GDP by 50, 70 basis points, somewhere in that neighborhood, total box demand. You got a couple of sub-segments like e-commerce that are growing very, very fast, but we've got pluses and minuses in some of the other segments, some of these trade wars and that crimp some of the exporters from the U.S. There's always something going on. But think about the third quarter. GDP 1.9, box demand, 1 5 and so it's possible that e-commerce can be growing double-digit, which it is, and box demand can be a shade below GDP. So I think the GDP number and what drive the U.S. economy, the components of it, are really what we need to look at in terms of trying to understand box demand. And there's obviously some periods where there's three quarters in a row where it attracts perfectly, and then there is some noise in the system. You think about when this noise started, it started to really show up around the time, we started talking about tariffs and trade, and a number of those things. So, I do think this notion of it being right below GDP is still pretty solid. Adam Josephson : Thanks so much, Mark. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Hi. Good morning and thanks for all the details. I wanted to just pick-up on the whole e-commerce piece again. Could you give us an idea of what proportion today it makes up of your overall domestic U.S. box demand? And it sounds to me, if it's up double-digit, that at least seems to be that it has either at versus flattening with what you've seen in recent years or maybe achieved and accelerated a little bit from what was at least earlier this year when Seok [ph] and other concern seems to suggest that may be the demand growth would slow from e-commerce. Mark Sutton : Chip, it's in the neighborhood between 5% and 10% of our demand. And you're right, things like Seok until you actually implement those. There's lot of different opinions on how it works. But again, back to the fundamental role, corrugated can play in the supply chain, most of those initiatives we see as if we do our job right and innovate, we see those as more net positives for corrugated box demand than negatives. Chip Dillon : Okay. And would you say there's been any real change in growth rate as you look at where we are now versus the last couple of years from e-commerce? Mark Sutton : No. Not really, it's still holding up solid double-digit. Chip Dillon : Okay. And then just two quick ones, as a follow-up. You had caution with the whole China export board side from China, that would seem to be the one that had the most yellow, I would say, on the chart. Is that more from a knowledge that you think it's going to stay weak for an indefinite period or just the fact that the information from China just seems to be so murky, you just can't tell? And then other question is, can you just update us on long-term timing of some of the projects, we've heard about at Ilim in the next several years? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. So the view that we shared in the prepared remarks up on demand and inventory in the region, that's our current view. It comes from a lot of sources. Yeah, there are some reported numbers in places, it's what we see on the ground is we interact with customers for the most part. Chip Dillon : Okay. Tim Nicholls : And then on Ilim, the project around containerboard has been approved. It will start going forward. But that's a couple of 2.5 years, three years before anything starts slowing to market. Chip Dillon : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi. Good morning. Mark Sutton : Good morning, Debbie. Debbie Jones : I wanted to ask about the volume guidance, sequential volume guidance of up $25 million in Industrial Packaging. You typically in the past, we've seen the seasonal move being down at least in the North American business. So I wanted to understand what your assumptions are for domestic box shipments and containerboard going into that? And is this being fully offset, any sequential weakness being offset by expert, is that way to think about it? Or have we reached a point where e-commerce benefited actually making 4Q less having seasonal impact? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I think on the box side, we're anticipating a strong season. We'll see how it plays out. We expect e-commerce to be in a solid place. We are also starting to see export volume and export demand pick up, and so that is going to impact our fourth quarter in a positive way for volume that we did not have in the second and third quarter. Mark Sutton : I think, Debbie, on the e-commerce question, I think if you look back at the data over the last few years, the past peak in the third quarter dropped off in the fourth quarter has been evening out, because e-commerce would their value proposition have shortened shipping times and people are still active in the fourth quarter. And then it even, to some extent, spilled into the first quarter with the whole return cycle. So there's just been an evening out of the demand, less of the peak, less of the drop off. And that started if you remember right, probably in 2016 and then 2017 it become more even and we continue to see that. Tim Nicholls : The other thing that may be in your memory, Debbie is just the difference in days, especially last year from third to fourth. We had two less days in the fourth quarter last year versus the third, and we've got one less day this year. So it's a little bit better in than regard. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And my second question is focusing on paper. Could you talk a little bit more about the seasonal uptick in LatAm paper that didn't really materialize as you're expecting in the quarter. And I wanted to understand a bit better the improvement in operations and cost sequentially, you mentioned the LIFO benefit, and I didn\u2019t have any of that my model, just weren\u2019t understand where most of that came from? Tim Nicholls : Easy on the LIFO, we had a better fit in the third quarter that we don't expect to repeat in the fourth, and so that was what that comes it is about. On the seasonal demand, that didn't pick up. There were some delays in government buying programs around certain segments of Printing Papers in Brazil that came through, but came through late. And the export business, especially around other parts of Latin America where we ship just been pressured from imports and people have plenty of inventory so it's working off inventory position. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn over. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning Mark and Tim. Mark Sutton : Hey, Tim. Brian Maguire : Just wanted to come back to the really strong cost management in the quarter, a lot of moving pieces there, but on slide 30, you talked about some of the input cost trends there. It looks like fiber was a pretty meaningful one. I guess, I'm just trying to square the significant benefit you got from wood fiber, on that lets say the ballpark in $20 million with the average cost over to the right being up 1%, that you're paying. Just trying to figure out how that could have been. And maybe a little bit really to answer these questions earlier, just theorizing maybe you shifted a little bit more of the production over to recycled base from virgin. Is that part of it? Or other factors in there? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. It's Tim. So we've been battling wood cost all year long. If you remember, tremendous amount of rain and wet weather starting late fourth quarter last year and continuing into well into the first quarter this year. So, it's just a matter of being able to access and have availability. And then buy intelligently as we can to maintain the kind of inventory levels, that the mills that we need for wood fiber. It's starting to normalize. We're probably be pretty close to a more normalized cost, as we exit the year, but the wood piece has been a challenge all year long, of course. Brian Maguire : Okay. So the average cost up 1% or were they actually down versus 2Q, just trying to square that. Tim Nicholls : Slightly down. We've been managing it down all year long. So, we were really high as we exited last year. And it's been hardwood and softwood. Hardwood has been the one that's been a little bit harder to bring down. Softwood, we've had a greater degree of success faster so. Brian Maguire : Okay, great. And then adjust for my follow-up. Some of the new box business you called out that will kick in, in a couple of quarters. Just wonder if you could comment on the mixed impact of that, might have on pricing or margins, just how would you describe your business versus the current portfolio and the legacy portfolio? Tim Nicholls : Could you restate the question? I'm sorry we didn't hear the first part. Brian Maguire : Yeah. I was just asking about some of the new box business that you called out, taking into the next couple of quarters. Just interested to hear what the mix impact of that would be on the pricing on margin. How would you kind of compare that to maybe just same portfolio of customers? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I think it's probably pretty flat. We're out there winning business on the capability. What we do for our customers? How we service them? The innovation we bring and the quality. So, it's a pretty mix neutral type of equation. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And our final question today will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Tim, I've got a couple of box questions to kind of finish up on. One is we have the Chicago PMI up this morning, which was now more than five points just month-to-month. Can you help us think about, how you think about the relationship between indicators like that and your box business? And then, I got one other question on boxes? Tim Nicholls : Sure. Yeah. I mean, this is definitely related. I didn't see the numbers; I haven't called out to it yet. Whether it in the moment or there are some time lag. It's sort of manufacturing activity is what drives box demand. So there's got to be relationship there. I don't know if that's a moment in time and then reversion. But, as I said, our volume, we saw pickup in October and we're still anticipating a pretty strong fourth quarter. So, we'll see how it plays out. Mark Sutton : I think important thing, Mark, on things like purchasing managers index and those things is give it enough time. I mean, we've got a lot of disruption in the supply chain from manufacturing in the U.S., a lot of it related simply to the GM auto strike. And as you've got to let the data to play out but it is an input to many -- to our on demand model. Mark Wilde : Okay. And the other one I wondered about is just how you think about the impact of new converting capacity, because it seems like there is a lot of new converting capacity coming into the market. Just to name a few, you've got the D Smith and box-propalable building these mega plants in Indiana. France, building -- bringing a lot of capacity into the market. And then you've got some domestic public and private competitors that are also adding kind of a box capacity. So what kind of effect are you seeing in the market from all of this? And how do you think about how it plays out, especially in flat demand or flattish demand? Mark Sutton : I think the issue with converting is one of the tenants that needs to be, because of the nature of the product, on empty boxes what you're making. It needs to be close to the demand centers. And so what you see sometimes is in our case, we add to learning capacity where we have customers and the desire for it. We may actually have that capacity, but it could be clear across the country and will just not use that capacity and take a shipped out or to do whatever we have to do and then use the capacity close to the customer. So, I can't speak for all these companies that are building or adding. But that's how we think about it is. Converting capacity is that last step in value add and transformation of containerboard into something people actually buy. And for us, it's about capabilities near where our customers and our growth is. Mark Wilde : Okay. Good luck in the fourth quarter and as we move into next year. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez for closing comments. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you again for joining International Paper's Third Quarter Earnings Call. As always, Michele and I will be available for your follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you again for participating in today's International Paper Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Day Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, chairman and chief executive officer; and Tim Nicholls, senior vice president and chief financial officer. There is information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth-quarter 2019 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments on Slide 2, we also provide context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2019. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation and the flexibility of the company to navigate well even in challenging environments. While the US economy remains healthy, we managed through significant inventory headwinds and broader trade tensions that impacted our exports. Against this backdrop, we focused on optimizing our full-value chain. We grew with customers who are market leaders in their respective segments. We ran our manufacturing system well, and we leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting system, all of which allowed us to continue to grow value for our shareowners with an ROIC of nearly 11%, which is well above our cost of capital. On capital allocation, we're making choices consistent with our framework. In 2019, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also increased our dividend for the tenth consecutive year, reinforcing our policy of a strong and sustainable payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. And we repaid $1 billion of debt to maintain a strong balance sheet. We continue to invest strategically to strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. In 2019, we made targeted investments in our U.S. box business to enhance our capabilities and reinforce our strong position in the fastest-growing segments. We also made selective acquisitions in our European packaging business to expand the converting network around our Madrid mill. I also want to share some context around our decision to start monetizing our investment in Graphic Packaging, which we announced earlier this week. The thinking around the original structure was to maximize the value of our North American Consumer Packaging business by combining it with Graphic Packaging. The investment provided us time to evaluate the role of Consumer Packaging for IP, while participating in the benefits of the combined business in a tax-efficient structure. Ultimately, we determined that a significant addition to our portfolio in the North America Consumer Packaging space is not a strategic priority. So it makes sense to start monetizing our investment and deploy that capital consistent with our capital allocation framework. Turning to Slide 4 and full-year results. We delivered EBITDA of $3.9 billion and outstanding free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Revenue did decrease about 4% due to lower average pricing and the impact of lower export containerboard and pulp volumes. Our equity earnings were $250 million, including $207 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was also impacted by challenging pulp markets. Despite a less favorable commercial environment in 2019, we delivered healthy margins of about 17% by taking advantage of our manufacturing and supply chain expertise and managing our costs well in our three businesses. Now let's turn to the next slide and take a closer look at free cash flow. As you can see on Slide 5, International Paper generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2019, which puts our five-year average at $1.9 billion, reflecting our strong and sustainable cash generation. We proactively managed cash levers across the company to mitigate the impact of lower earnings and to exceed our full-year free cash flow commitment. Cash from operations was $3.6 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2018 and includes a $300 million improvement in working capital. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion or about $300 million lower than in 2018. We've often discussed IP's strong and resilient free cash flow. I think 2019, once again demonstrates our ability to deliver outstanding cash generation, even as we manage through more difficult market conditions. So now turning to Slide 6. We delivered another solid year of return on invested capital with a five-year average return of 11%. Our performance reflects the strength of our portfolio. We are making the right investment choices and delivering on those commitments. I'll now turn it over to Tim, who will cover the performance across our business segments, as well as our outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7, which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Operating earnings decreased by $0.89 to $4.43 per share in 2019 in what was clearly a challenging environment, especially outside the U.S. Our results, as Mark said, reflect our ability to optimize our mill and converting systems and manage marginal costs as we matched our production to our customers' needs. Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a headwind, mostly due to significant price pressure in export pulp and containerboard markets, as well as the price impact of index movements in our North American packaging business. Volume was a drag on earnings largely due to challenging export markets. Export containerboard was impacted by unusually high customer inventories as we enter 2019, and it took about three quarters to normalize. Operations and costs were impacted by significant economic downtime, especially in the first half of the year as export shipments slowed and we reduced inventories across our North American packaging system on improved supply chain velocity and reliability. Input costs were favorable for the full year, driven mostly by lower recovered fiber and energy costs. And even though wood cost moderated in the second half of the year, they were actually a significant drag on earnings in 2019. All in, corporate items were favorable, with lower corporate and interest expense partly offset by higher tax expense in 2019. Equity earnings decreased due to lower Ilim earnings. Turning to Slide 8 and our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1 billion with margins of 18%. The year-over-year revenue decline is mostly driven by lower pricing and packaging in Global Cellulose Fibers, as well as the impact of the India divestment earlier in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was again strong as we continue to proactively manage capital spending and working capital. During the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by nearly $600 million. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 9. Operating earnings were unchanged at $1.09. Price or mix was a headwind due to the prior index movements in Global Cellulose Fibers and North American packaging, as well as the lower prices in export containerboard. Volume improved in the quarter due to stronger containerboard exports as expected, as well as higher seasonal demand in Latin American papers and European packaging. Operations and costs were offset in the quarter by favorable maintenance outage costs and input costs improved due to lower wood and chemical costs. Corporate items were also favorable and equity earnings were essentially flat. So we'll turn to the segments, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 10. Our business performed well. The North America business earned $584 million with margins of nearly 25% and a light maintenance outage quarter. Across the segment, price and mix was unfavorable due to the impact of prior index movement in North America, as well as the mix impact of higher containerboard exports in the fourth quarter as we expected. Staying with containerboard exports, demand is healthy and customer inventory levels have normalized across most regions. It may even be on the low side in select areas as we enter this year. Volume improved sequentially, driven by containerboard exports, as well as stronger seasonal demand in our European packaging business. In North America, we had strong double-digit growth in e-commerce. And the protein segment continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, while processed foods and durables continue to lag the broader strength of the U.S. economy. Demand in January is off to a pretty good start for us at a plus 1% to 2%. The growth trend we discussed last quarter is coming through as expected as we ramp up our recent business wins. Operational performance was favorable. Economic downtime decreased significantly in the fourth quarter as we increase production to meet stronger demand. Operations and costs also benefited by about $40 million of onetime items, including a favorable LIFO inventory adjustment. Input costs were also favorable across the segment, driven by lower cost for wood and chemicals. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 11. Fourth-quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions and a very challenging supply demand condition. The near-term headwinds we have faced in the business have been material due to the severity of the commodity pulp cycle. It has resulted in more supply of fluff pulp and a higher mix of market pulp in our business. In light of the current performance and our outlook, we have impaired the full amount of the goodwill in the business of $52 million, which is a special item in the quarter. We expect very challenging earnings in the first half of 2020 due to the flow-through of prices from 2019 and the impact of higher maintenance outage expenses. We do see better fundamentals as we enter 2020. Customer fluff inventories have normalized and underlying demand is improving. Looking beyond the improving supply demand conditions, our strategy is to grow profitably in fluff pulp to reduce our market pulp mix. We continue to feel good about the 2% to 3% structural demand growth with fluff pulp, which is our focus. We had a successful contract season and are on pace to bring fluff and specialty mix to 75% of total volume in 2020. All of this positions us for an improvement in the second half of the year. Looking to Printing Papers on Slide 12. The business delivered earnings of $109 million in the quarter. Across the segment, price and mix decreased mostly due to lower pricing for exports from our North America and Latin American paper business, as well as the mix impact of higher export volume from North America. Volume improved sequentially across all regions. Demand in Brazil was seasonally stronger as expected, but was partially offset by weaker demand in Latin American countries due to the geopolitical environment. In our North American business, we had strong performance in cut size with new customer business. However, the roll business was weak due to challenging conditions in commercial printing. Mill performance was solid across the segment. Operations and cost was impacted by a noncash LIFO inventory charge of about $15 million, mostly related to the hardwood inventory adjustments at Riverdale as we execute the conversion and some other onetime charges. Input costs improved across the sector on lower purchase pulp prices in Brazil and lower hardwood cost in North America. Staying with Printing Papers, uncoated free sheet shipments in North America were volatile in 2019 due to the influence of trade flows through the year. Fundamentally, though, we continue to see long-term secular decline of about 4%, in line going forward with the two-year industry average over the past few years at 3.7%. Looking at Ilim results on Slide 13. The joint venture delivered $21 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter. Volume improved as expected, with no planned maintenance outages in the quarter, and was offset by negative price flow-through. Equity earnings include a foreign exchange gain on Ilim's US dollar-denominated net debt of which IP's after-tax portion was $8 million or $0.02 per share. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $706 million, which represents a 32% margin. Full-year equity earnings were $207 million. And although 2019 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance and low-cost system make it a powerful cash generator, and we expect to receive about $120 million in dividends from Ilim in 2020. On Slide 14, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2019 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper in 2020. Starting with the balance sheet. Our commitment is unchanged. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating with a target debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis. In 2019, we repaid $1 billion of debt and our pension gap decreased by $200 million. Our pension plan is sufficiently funded, and we feel really good about the actions we've taken to derisk the plan. All in, we closed 2019 at 2.8 times leverage, which was flat with prior year. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2019, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And over the past five years, we've returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders or about 60% of free cash flow. As Mark said earlier, in 2019, we increased our dividend for a tenth consecutive year, reinforcing our commitment to a competitive and sustainable dividend of 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Looking ahead to 2020, free cash flow after dividends will continue to be directed to debt reduction and share repurchases. Looking at investments, we continue to proactively manage capital spending as we invest to maintain our world-class systems and strengthen our packaging business. The types of M&A we would be interested in are targeted smaller scale opportunities that would round out our capabilities and create value. And with regard to the Graphic Packaging transaction we announced earlier this week, we received $250 million in cash from Graphic Packaging, which is the maximum amount permitted in each period under the agreement. We do not expect to pay taxes on this initial transaction. Our ownership interest in Graphic Packaging is now approximately 18.3%. This transaction puts us on a monetization path. Moving to our full-year outlook on Slide 15. We're projecting full year EBITDA for the company of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion. This is driven by the full-year impact of price carryover from 2019 as well as the January containerboard index movement. We also plan about $70 million of higher maintenance outage expense in 2020, as we execute a high cold outage cycle. To put this in context, we completed two cold outages across our system in 2019 compared to eight cold outages planned for this year. And lastly, we anticipate about $80 million of cost related to the Riverdale conversion in 2020, including the impact of unabsorbed fixed cost. Free cash flow is expected to be at $1.7 billion, and we will proactively manage capital spending with a cap of $1 billion. Proceeds from the Graphic Packaging monetization, like all of our cash, will be put through our capital allocation framework. Turning to Slide 16 and our first quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to be down $30 million on the flow-through of prior index movements in North America. Volume is expected to be down $20 million on lower seasonal demand in North America. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $85 million, partly due to the nonrepeat of favorable LIFO adjustments in the fourth quarter. Included in this $85 million is $20 million of unabsorbed fixed costs related to the Riverdale mill conversion. And staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $93 million, and input costs are expected to be seasonally higher by about $15 million. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be down $15 million on the impact of prior index movement. Volume is expected to improve by $5 million on improved fluff volume. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $20 million and inputs are expected to remain stable. Moving to Printing Papers. Price flow-through was offset by improved geographic mix. Volume is expected to be down $50 million, mostly on lower seasonal demand in Brazil. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $40 million, mostly due to the nonrepeat of LIFO charges in the fourth quarter and improved fixed cost absorption in North America. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $17 million, and input costs are expected to remain stable. As noted in the segment details I just shared, maintenance outages all-in are expected to increase by $130 million in the first quarter. Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix. And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. I'm on Slide 17. As I reflect on our performance this past year, it reaffirms my confidence in International Paper. I've often commented on these quarterly calls about our ability to succeed and generate strong cash flow through practically any set of conditions. And I think that's exactly how 2019 played out. As we enter 2020, we are delivering commercial wins and we'll continue to tightly manage our cost, capital spending and working capital to generate strong free cash flow despite earnings headwinds that we look at as cyclical. And most of these earnings headwinds that are price related are due to flow-through from actions that have already occurred in 2019. The fundamentals of our packaging and fluff pulp business are solid. Our commercial and operational levers position us for positive momentum as we navigate through the year. International Paper has the best customers, the best people, the best system and a strong financial position, and we'll continue to make the choice as consistent with our capital allocation framework in order to drive long-term value creation. With that, I think we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. We saw some signs of improvement in China and the pulp market at the end of last year, kind of beginning of this year. The coronavirus has obviously kind of shaken things up. I was wondering if you could talk about what impact you're maybe seeing to your customers, I guess, on the pulp side in China, understanding the situation is unfolding? Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Anthony. I think the coronavirus, we see what you just mentioned, improving conditions, both on the demand and on the economics. The virus issue is obviously a fluid situation and it's kind of early to tell. There are inventories in the system. The kind of products that our pulp goes into from GCF, from our cellulose fibers business, is an absorbent pulp. The type of products that tend to be a little less discretionary. On our Ilim joint venture, it's more market pulp for packaging and other softwood market uses. And they have seen some improvements as well. I think we're all watching very closely and looking at different contingencies based on the virus, which I think they'll get through. But the question is, how long does it take? Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then your 2020 guidance suggests capex could be below $1 billion. And I don't think IP's capex has been below $1 billion for maybe a decade. I'm just wondering what the split there is between maintenance and discretionary? Maybe what kind of investments maybe you're pulling back on? And then just how you would frame that capex level versus a normalized level versus where we might be in the cycle? Mark Sutton : That's a great question because it is a number you haven't seen. Well, let me just make a high level comment. I'll ask Tim to talk about the categories. Over these periods of time that you mentioned, we're not the same company, obviously, in terms of asset quality, the amount of strategic investment, which we've done a lot organic strategic investment in the last few years. And as we said earlier, last year on, I think, would be the third quarter call, we don't have those type of large projects every period. So the combination of all that allows us to have periods where we'll have less. Our guidance has always been about $1.4 billion over time. But it wouldn't be that every year. And Tim, if you want to add a little clarity to the category? Tim Nicholls : Yes, I think you covered it well in terms of talking about the ramp down and the strategic projects. It's roughly 60% that we have targeted for maintenance and regulatory and then the balance being discretionary. But you're right, $1 billion is on the high side, it could be lower than that. It could be closer to $900 million for the year. Operator : Next question is from Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : First quick question. If I'm not mistaken, your free cash flow was $300 million above your $2 billion guidance. So was that surplus due to mainly the working capital? Or can you elaborate, Tim? Tim Nicholls : Yes, that was a big piece of it. There are several factors. One, there was some timing on some items. We had lower capital spending than what we had earlier estimated in the year. And then working capital. We picked up some things. Part of it is timing. We'll keep it. Part of it is just from one year to the next and so it will probably come back in 2020. Steve Chercover : And then to quote you on Graphic Packaging, you're on a monetization path. So is it a bold assumption to say that you get another $250,000 that will be put toward the repo and/or debt reduction? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean, we'll put it through the capital allocation framework. And that's the primary focus that we have right now. So I don't assume any difference. And just to clarify, a maximum of $250 million every six months that we have, under the contract, the ability to monetize. Steve Chercover : Can I just ask one other question? You've got some flexibility. Obviously, it should be share price dependent, right? I guess the valuation of GPK will have some influence on your timing. Tim Nicholls : It will, I would say, modestly, but we're not -- we don't think of ourselves as investors in equity shares. So we're not trying to time the market in an undue way. We're trying to just make sure we're smart about how we think through our right some of the contracts to monetize the stake that we have. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I wanted to talk about the maintenance spending that you're doing this year. And you've said that there are eight cold outages this year versus two last year. Away from those numbers, when you're done with the projects this year, Mark, what will be further enabled either within Industrial Packaging or GCF that you don't have already from the maintenance? Or will it be obviously, much of it is going to be related to normal maintenance, but what will be the different capabilities out of the systems on either side when we're done with this? Mark Sutton : George, I think one key point on maintenance is we talk about the capital, and that's a portion of maintenance, but a much bigger portion is just on the expense side and how we do precision maintenance, how we make repairs, how well-trained our technical staffs are. And they're just getting better every year. So we have less failures. We expect better reliability, which ends up resulting in needing less capital for major replacements. And that's just been a continuing story for IP. So we spend the money on the expense side in education, training, techniques, and we save the money on the capital side. That's one point. What we've been trying to do is make sure that in containerboard and in the new cellulose fibers business that we combined with the former Weyerhaeuser business that we have flexibility in the system so that we can make multiple products at multiple facilities, that's a strong value proposition for our customers. It's great in terms of managing marginal cost for wood or transportation. So what you'll see out of this is less variability between the worst facility we have in terms of reliability and capability and the best. So both systems are going to be more flexible and less variation. There's much more work to do, but we have made a lot of progress. And so it's kind of normal that we would have a period where we can enjoy some of the kind of fruits of the investments we've made. So capability and consistency across those mill systems. In one case, feeding box plants, largely our own box plants. In the other case, going directly to customers who convert into absorbent products. George Staphos : So tying a bow on that, so part of what you'll get also is an ability to further make your cost variable as opposed to fixed, depending on the system that you're in or the environment that you're in. Would that be fair? Mark Sutton : That's fair, George. And you saw that. Again, we don't want to get too good at this because it usually only gets to show up when we're taking economic downtime, and markets are slower, but you saw a kind of a sort of a step change in 2019, containerboard LLO experience and our marginal cost management versus prior periods a few years earlier. And we would expect that to continue. So variabilizing our cost and getting better at marginal cost management is definitely part of it. There are some structural cost issues in some of our mills, especially on the GCF side that are not related to reliability. Just related to configuration and there's things there that we can address and will address in the future as our resources and priorities allow us to. George Staphos : Okay. Second question, I'll try to make it quick. You mentioned that 60% of your free cash flow over the last five years has been dedicated to value return to the shareholder and your performance on cash flow and your performance returning value back to the shareholders has been impressive. Given the target of 40% to 50% over time, would it suggest that maybe that ratio necessarily has to come down as you delever? Or we shouldn't draw that conclusion? And what kind of circumstances would we need to see where the dividend, which looks to be amply supported now, might be something that is a little bit more at risk? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Tim Nicholls : Well, the approach we take to the dividend, George, and thanks for the question, is that it's both competitive and sustainable. And so when we make these decisions, when we put forth recommendations to our Board and they decide dividend policy, we are trough testing and providing ample outlook for how we think the business is going to perform. So I don't see a need for the first part of your question and taking the action there, I think we're in a bit of a trough year. We're still on the high end, but within the range. And I think we have the flexibility to do what we need to do across our capital allocation choices. Mark Sutton : I think also just an additional point on Tim's comment, is when you think about the combination of near-term capital return via the dividend and the share repurchase, we have reduced our shares outstanding and the actual outlay for the dividend is -- even though we've raised the dividend, as you can figure out for yourself, not growing in terms of pure cash outlay. So we're committed to the dividend. We think 40% to 50% has got the right balance of getting cash to shareholders, but not doing it in a way that's not sustainable. And I mean, that's what we're focused on in the company is generating the cash that's in trough, testing our recommendations to make sure that we are, in any case, talking about the dividend not being sustainable. Operator : Next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Good morning and thanks for all the help. If you could talk a little bit about the South American business, I think, firstly, in corrugated, I know that's something I think you're looking to exit. And I just wanted to know, a, how that's going? And b, you mentioned some targeted M&A possibilities. I don't know if there is a chance that you might actually want to keep a presence in Brazil and if that would be a possibility? Tim Nicholls : On packaging? Chip Dillon : Yes. Tim Nicholls : No, no. We've talked about strategic options. The process has taken a little bit longer than we thought. But we don't want this to go on forever. But I think it started slower based on just some timing and holidays and gearing up. We have made progress. I think we'll be in a position in the not-too-distant future to talk to you about the outcome. But in terms of an acquisition on packaging in Brazil, as we're still looking at options for how we exit that business, there's nothing that we're looking at. Mark Sutton : When Tim was talking in his remarks about capital allocation and we made a comment about investments and targeted small acquisitions, if there are any, those are primarily for our North American Industrial Packaging business and for our European packaging business, like we did a few, we bought a few box plants right near the Madrid mill. That's what he was referring to on targeted M&A for packaging, not anything else. Tim Nicholls : And just to put some brackets around it in terms of size and the targeted nature of it and how it improves the business that we have, like packaging. Chip Dillon : Okay. That's super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. When you look at the capex level going down to like $900 million to $1 billion, which certainly makes a lot of sense given the very immediate environment and certainly keeps your flexibility as high as it's been. Is that sort of a level -- I mean, that should include, I assume some Riverdale expense -- capex. So what should we kind of guess capex will be or would you expect capex to be in the '21, '22, '23 period? Let's say, things get that better, is there a reason that capex would rise up again, given your current footprint? Tim Nicholls : Should that be situational, I think from a strategic investment type, the bigger capital there, those get identified over time. We don't act on all of them. The cost reduction side of it is where I think you could see an increase over time. But like I said, it depends on the circumstances, the market conditions and how the business is performing. So we don't forecast publicly that far out in time. But situationally, I think we're in a spot where we can maintain around the level we have. If conditions warrant, we can take advantage of some high return cost reduction type projects to improve the business. Mark Sutton : Yes. I think, Chip, the way we're thinking about this, if you go back all the way to 2014, where we started investing in our North American containerboard system for lots of reasons to replace the purchase board we were doing post the Temple acquisition to improve all the things I talked about in the prior answer, there's been a steady demand for large projects in our mill system and containerboard. Then we built the Madrid mill, and now we're doing Riverdale. We've got the capacity we need and the capability we need largely for the foreseeable future, not only in that business but also in cellulose fibers. And so structural cost reduction in our system probably hasn't gotten the same level of attention, and that will be a focus going forward. But it's not as large as individual projects. It's smaller projects across more facilities. So depending on what the environment looks like, how much product we need based on our order book, we can time those structural cost reduction projects a little bit better than the strategic projects where you're trying to bring something on to market. So that will be the focus going forward. We don't have an exact number past 2020, but it'll be a different mix of projects because we've made the investments we need to make for the foreseeable future. Chip Dillon : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning Mark, thank you. I think you owe the Industrial Packaging crew lunch today. Mark Sutton : That happens often. Mark Wilde : Well, that's a very good performance. Listen, the question I had, the recovery in pulp performance, it sounds like there are a couple of moving pieces we need to be conscious of as we go through '20. One is kind of a lag in kind of pricing and the other is kind of the shift in mix. So Tim, I wondered if you could just help us with a little more color on that? Tim Nicholls : Well, I'll help you with as much as I can give. I mean, you see the price follow-on. We do think that markets have begun stabilizing. And so the question will be recovery and how fast it comes on the pricing front. But inventory levels after some weak market conditions based on individual country economies, region economies, as well as the tariff situation, we think, had a fairly dramatic impact on price as we went through 2019 that we carry into this year. But we think that we are in a place where fundamentals have shifted and look like they're beginning to improve. On the mix side, because of the lower growth for fluff overall, based on those factors, we had a higher percent of commodity market pulp in our mix, for certain types of grades on -- certainly on Southern soft bleach, we have a higher cost structure. We have a very good cost structure in our mill in Canada for Northern bleach. But for Southern, we have a higher cost structure and prices were impacted more. So that weighed on the business as well. Going forward, it's about intelligently restoring the fluff and absorbent specialty percent of our mix based on the commercial loss that we talked about last year, but doing it in a way that maximizes profit over time. So we're not just simply focused on volume. We're focused on how do we improve the earnings performance of the business and working through these macro challenges in the moment. Mark Wilde : And for a follow-on, I just wondered, Mark, can you update us on sort of where the Ilim capital plans are? I know that they've had some big projects talked about over time, but I don't know whether there's been any commitment to those. So if you could update us. Mark Sutton : Sure. The Ilim Board approved some projects involving some containerboard production, primarily for China. And so that's under way and additional softwood pulp at one of the existing facilities, debottlenecking one of the facilities. So both of those projects are approved and are beginning to get under way and will come online later in next year. So right now, the focus for Ilim is, as anybody in the softwood pulp business, is looking at getting the inventory stabilized and getting the market pricing, hopefully, back to a more normalized level. As Tim mentioned in the Ilim results, even at these lower cyclical price levels for commodity pulp, the Ilim cost structure is so far out ahead of everything else in the world that it's still a very, very powerful cash generator. And that's really what we want to do in our GCF business, which is really absorbent pulp focused. We are still 10 percentage points away from the mix. We really target to have 85% of our capacity, which is essentially all of our North American mills, on absorbent pulp, and only the Canadian northern bleached softwood mill on nonabsorbent pulp. And with a demand step back in the China economy, it just takes longer to get that mix up, as Tim said, intelligently, where we're doing it at a profitable level. So it's a setback in terms of the path we were on, but it's still the right path. And the business and the end-use and the customer book is all very solid. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital. Adam Josephson : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, just one on pulp. On Slide 11, you talk about a successful contract season accelerating your recovery this year. Can you just help me with what your pricing visibility is on contracts that you successfully renewed or secured? I'm just wondering if you know what pricing on that business will be throughout the year? Or it's similar to market pulp in that regard? And then just you mentioned fluff is growing at a lower rate than market. I was just wondering just intuitively, why that would be the case. Tim Nicholls : Yes. On the growth, I think we've had some unusual challenges. We've had certain countries in the Middle East, which are big fluff pulp consumers, their economies have underperformed, their currencies have underperformed against the dollar. There has been some, for a moment, demand destruction. There's been the tariff issue in China, which had to be sorted through and caused a lot of uncertainty. And so I think there's been the combination of some demand destruction in the moment. We don't think it's structural. And there's also the fact that we had inflated inventories around the world last year for a big part of the year that had to be rebalanced on fluff pulp. On the contracts on pricing, you can appreciate why I can't go into a whole lot of detail here, but it's really across the gamut. There's different customer types that we have. And some of those work on annual contracts with price negotiations that happen as you go through the year. Some of them are annual in the nature of the amount of volume they're going to take. And then there's openers along the way. And then we have parts of the market that it's month to month or quarter to quarter. Adam Josephson : And then, Mark, just one on U.S. box demand, at least through November, it was about flat last year after having been up quite a bit from '16 to '18. Over the past decade, it's flat or so. So what do you think, just, I guess, forget about longer term, but what are you expecting this year? Do you have any reason to think this year, Mark, will be much different than the flattish we saw last year for any particular reason? Mark Sutton : Yes. We look at a lot of economic leading indicators that correlate very nicely with box demand. We built our own internal International Paper model and it was reasonably accurate for last year. We see a little bit of growth this year. But I think when you look at what came out today on the GDP number and you think about box demand occasionally, it'll track GDP, but largely in the way the U.S. economy is configured, it'll always lag that a little bit. So a 2% year, roughly, is what it looks like 2019 was and you'll end up with a box demand that for the inventory issues we talked about that occurred at the end of '18 in our customers' world, you end up with a little bit of a disconnect from GDP. I think without that inventory issue, I think you probably saw 1.3% to 1.5% box demand in '19 against a 2% GDP. And I think the reason that didn't happen is some of the '18 kind of stronger demand was really '19. We made boxes in '18 for our customers who didn't ship the product to well into '19. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : First, on the outlook. You noted that it includes the impact of 2019 price carryover in January containerboard index adjustment. Does that mean that it doesn't include any other potential changes, and so pricing is effectively kept flat from where it is? Or is that not necessarily a conclusion to draw? Tim Nicholls : Well, the challenge is we don't talk about pricing on a go-forward basis. So we have carried in all of the carryover from last year to where we currently are. We have included the $10 published down for a containerboard that just happened. And within that range is our view on how we think about price over the course of 2020. Mark Weintraub : I understand. Also, the inventory valuation impact in packaging and paper, could you specify those for us? Tim Nicholls : Yes, both of them are to do with LIFO. And as you know, we go through the year looking at how a number of factors are going to play out over the course of the year, and we're making estimates about what the LIFO charge is. As you get to the end of the year, you're truing up all of those. In the case of papers, we had overestimated our benefit, where we thought we were going to be earlier in the third quarter, and it actually ended up in a worse position. So we had to make that true-up and just the opposite on the containerboard side. As you go through the year, it's not a precise science, and we're putting our best estimates based on business conditions. And as forecast factors change, then we have to make sure that we've [indiscernible] it up to the appropriate amount at the end of the year. Mark Weintraub : Understood. And can you share with us what the adjustments in the fourth quarter were in the segments? Tim Nicholls : Yes, I think we did. It was $15 million in papers, and it was around $40 million in Industrial Packaging. Mark Weintraub : Great. And then lastly, on the box shipments. So it sounds -- is the win that we should get from not having, hopefully, any inventory destocking this year, in the 0.5% to 1% range, would you say? And also, could you let us know how January had played out? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I know there's a lot of calls today, Mark. Right now, January looks like it's somewhere between 1% and 2%. We're late in the month and you say, well, shouldn't you know better? But we don't really have a final number until we go through the close process and see how shipments actually came in. But we're seeing some of the wins that we talked about in the third quarter actually coming through in our North American container business. So we feel good about that. On the export containerboard side, we referenced inventory levels having returned to normalized levels late last year. But in some places, in some markets, our view is that inventory levels are low. Demand is very good right now. And so in the export markets, we think it's normal to skew on the lower side for inventory levels. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Connelly of Stephens Inc. Mark Connelly : Thanks. We've obviously seen you take quite a lot of downtime without the sort of cost drags that would have been evident in the past. So clearly, all the work on the supply chain is working. I'm curious if your experience over the past year is leading to more changes? And if, in effect, you're getting more efficient at taking that downtime? Mark Sutton : Well, it's a great question, Mark. And I would say the short answer is yes. We took a level of downtime in containerboard last year that we haven't taken before. So we were able to do it a little more efficiently, primarily because of some of the investments we made in the '14, '15, '16 time frame. We also learned a little bit more about how to better manage the transportation component when we know we're going to take downtime and the wood fiber component. So I think we're actively learning how to manage our output to meet our customer demand across multiple facilities a little bit better each year. '18, we ran everything wide open, and there was none of that work being done because we almost couldn't make enough product for all channels that we serve. And we actually added costs in some cases to make that incremental amount. So I think last year afforded us an opportunity to really try to use the benefits of all the investments we made, both capital and noncapital in systems and so forth in the supply chain. So I would say, yes, we are continuing to learn how to do that better. Mark Connelly : That's helpful. And one more question on pulp, and I'm sorry to keep bugging on this question, but fluff markets have been tracking commodity markets a lot more closely in the last couple of years, and that's not normal. So what has to happen, say, in the medium term? Sometimes when markets get soft, contract terms get squishy, and you start to increase that volatility. Is it going to take longer to get back to that normal because we've got a cleanup contract messiness? Mark Sutton : I think, Mark, that's a great question. I think two main things going on with the connection between fluff pulp and the broader commodity markets. One is the shape of the curves on pricing, for example, are similar, but there's still a pretty healthy differential between the two, as there should be. There's a level of capacity in the market because fluff is still a relatively small market in terms of the other markets. It's about six million tons. There's about 15% capacity that can move in or out of the lower ends of fluff, based on what's happening in commodity pulp. The same producer has a choice. We don't have any of that capacity, but others do. And so it's a meaningful flex capacity that just needs to be absorbed as the market grows. Over time, I think that will buffet things a little bit better. And then, of course, any time you have these kind of conditions, you end up with contract terms and agreements that's probably not sustainable long term. So there is some of that, that has to be done. But this flexible capacity that can make softwood market or softwood absorbent is meaningful enough that in soft demand for market pulp or lower, lower price environments for market pulp, it ends up showing up just in enough at the margins to create some issues on the absorbent side. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Just a couple around capital reallocation. Obviously, with the recent cellulose fiber acquisition, they're writing off the goodwill and the challenges in the pulp market. Just wondering, in aggregate, does that make you less likely or a little bit more gun-shy about doing large M&A? I think some of your comments sort of alluded to really just focusing on smaller bolt-on deals. And then just sort of related to that, it seems like the leverage is set to move higher with the lower EBITDA guidance in 2020. So should we assume that kind of the focus, the priority for the near-term is more on preserving the balance sheet as opposed to share repurchase and things like that? Mark Sutton : I think on the first part of your question, Brian, the large M&A is not a focus right now because it's not necessary for International Paper. We've got a great company. We've got the ability to improve the businesses we have. We've done a lot of large M&A in the past, and it's now time for us to optimize this and to profitably grow the target businesses, which don't require large M&A. So the second part of your question, I think we'll see how the year plays out. But the combination, I think we put it on our chart, of debt repayment and share repurchase is a constant discussion in the company about which channel through our capital allocation framework to flow that cash. We have an outlook. We're sitting here in January, but we really don't know how the year is going to turn out. And it could be better or it could be not as good, and we'll make the decisions. But obviously, maintaining that balance sheet, investment grade, as Tim said, is an absolute priority, and we'll make the cash flow adjustments we need to make sure that happens. Tim Nicholls : Yes. And the only thing I would add is we have been very clear about our commitment to the balance sheet and how we would manage that. We've been very clear about our approach to returning cash to shareowners. I think Mark's right. It's dynamic. So we have to see how markets and results play out. We never viewed that we would be within the 2.5 to 2.8 times 100% of the time. We always thought that there could be reasons. But we don't want to be extremely wide of those, and we don't want to be there for long. And so we have a very strong commitment to support the credit rating that we have. We also are looking at share repurchase and making sure that we are returning value to shareowners. It'll be dynamic. Brian Maguire : And then my last question is just more of a longer term, a bit of an open-ended question. Obviously, 2020 EBITDA is a bit cyclically depressed. You're cutting back on capex a bit, some of the growth in productivity projects. I guess the question is, beyond 2020, where should we think about earnings growth coming from beyond price increases. In other words, if we don't get any movement higher in pricing beyond 2020, where would be the drivers of earnings growth from there? Mark Sutton : I think the earnings growth will come from beyond any market pricing moves is the commercial investments we've made on new products, better mix and growing our business in the segments that are growing the most. And that's a true statement for our box business as well as our cellulose fibers business. And then there's a healthy dose of constantly looking at our cost structure and improving that over time. Operator : Our final question for today comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Just two questions. I'm going to ask them together. Are you happy with your current European footprint? I know you aren't targeting any major M&A as you outlined earlier, but I'm just curious of your overall position there and how you feel about it. And then secondly, could you characterize any major differences that you're seeing with the way that your customers in Europe versus the US have needs as they relate to their sustainability efforts? Mark Sutton : So I think the first answer is, yes, we are happy with our footprint. There are some issues that we're trying to sort out around whether they're structural or cyclical, like the market in Turkey, for example, which has been good and not so good over time. But we do like the business format we have, which is now that we have a large high-performance mill in the mix. And so we're continuing to look to improve that business from its core. And then on sustainability, I just think Europe tends to be a year or two ahead of this market in sustainability initiatives, and it's largely partly due to regulation and partly due to just the consumer and the mindfulness of the consumer. But I think Europe is a good leading indicator for a lot of things that we learn there, we are able to prepare for here, but it might be a year or two later. But I think that the role fiber packaging is playing in helping customers in various market segments with their sustainability story -- the fact that we've got renewable natural resources, recyclable products and our energy is generated from carbon neutral biomass is playing very, very heavily and well with our customers. So before we sign off, I just want to wrap up a couple of key points that we talked about. Our focus for this year and beyond is delivering on the commercial wins. We've made a lot of investments in talent, approaches, equipment, innovation, and that's what we're focused on, on the commercial side. We're looking at the levers we discussed today to generate free cash flow. We'll get to a strong free cash flow year by year by year, slightly different ways but what you can count on from IP is to deliver it. We believe our core businesses have solid long-term fundamentals. There'll always be some cyclicality. We're seeing some of that now. But the fundamentals of what we make in boxes and what we make in our fluff pulp and the role that our paper business plays are solid and we believe in them for the future. And I think some of the things we talked about today, commercially, operationally, give us momentum as we navigate through the year of 2020. And I feel good about where we are as a company, strong balance sheet, as I said outstanding customers and outstanding people. And the ability for a year like 2019 to still show us that we can generate strong free cash flow, share it with our investors, make smart investments and the company gets stronger every year. So with that Guillermo, I'll turn it back over to you. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, again, for joining International Paper's fourth-quarter earnings call. As always, Michelle and I will be available for your follow-up questions. Thank you.

At this time, all participant lines are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my now great pleasure to turn conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, [Monee] (Ph). Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make Forward-Looking Statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S.GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter 2020 earnings press release and today\u2019s presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, Slide 2 also provide context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike anything we have ever experienced. This pandemic brings unprecedented challenges and requires us to focus on what we as a company needs to do to remain strong and resilient for all our stakeholders in the short-term and the long-term. International Paper entered this crisis in a position of strength. No strength is more important than a talent commitment of our 50,000 employees worldwide. Our most important responsibility is the health and safety of our employees and contractors. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees across the Company and all of the business and support groups for their commitment and ability to adapt in this challenging period. I\u2019m especially grateful to our frontline employees in manufacturing and converting facilities around the world. They ensure our customers and continue to supply the essential products to consumers around the world. We also went through this crisis with world-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Our scale, flexibility and geographic reach allows us to meet our customers rapidly changing needs, which is more important than ever in times like this. And we have a strong balance sheet and liquidity positions that provides us financial flexibility to navigate through this period of great uncertainty. Turning to Slide 4. International Paper is a critical part of the supply chain required to produce and deliver essential food, pharmaceutical, hygiene products and emergency supplies for consumers around the world. This privilege comes with enormous responsibility to our employees and our customers. We have taken significant steps to protect our employees and contractors. We also implemented contact treating protocols and all of our facilities. Our COVID-19 measures have proven to be effective, and we have not had any material disruptions to our operations. I\u2019m proud of the collaboration, ingenuity and commitment of our employees to take care of our customers during this pandemic. Some of our teams have generated product and service innovations for customers, while others have found ways to simplify and streamline work. All of which is essential and navigating effectively through the enormous dislocations caused by COVID-19. A few example, our packaging business developed corrugated separators to allow citrus customers to run their packing operations with appropriate social distancing protection at the height of the harvest season. Our global cellulose fibers business is ensuring customers have real time visibility of their orders, which is especially critical when ocean supply chains have stretched out. And our papers business quickly introduced new packaging sizes that allow safe home deliveries of uncoated free sheet products. As I have said earlier, International Paper entered this crisis in a strong financial position. Due to the unprecedented uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic impact of COVID-19, we are taking prudent actions to further strengthen the Company\u2019s liquidity and preserve cash. We are undertaking vigorous sensitivity and scenario testing to make sure we make informed principle based decisions. And we manage each phase of this crisis with a view toward both the short-term and long-term success and sustainability of the Company for all of our stakeholders. Now let\u2019s turn to our first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered a solid performance with EBITDA of $802 million and free cash flow of $363 million in a very rapidly changing environment as containment measures across the globe accelerated. I\u2019m inspired by the commitment and resilience of our teams who under unprecedented circumstances delivered strong operational performance in our mills and converting plants. In our packaging business we were able to mitigate the impact of significant production loss in our Rome and Bogalusa mills. We leveraged the scale and flexibility of our system to meet strong demand for corrugated packaging and absorbent pulp and through outstanding collaboration across our commercial supply chain and manufacturing organizations, we adapted quickly to meet our customer\u2019s rapidly changing needs, all of which contributed to solid performance in the first quarter and further strengthen our position as we navigate the uncertainty that lies ahead. I will turn it over now to Tim to cover performance across our business segments, our second quarter outlook and details on the actions we have taken to further strengthen our liquidity. Tim. Tim Nicholls : Thanks, Mark. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m on Slide 6, which shows our first quarter results. As Mark mentioned, EBITDA and free cash flow were solid, operating earnings were $0.57 per share, which included an unfavorable Ilim FX non-cash impact of $0.13 in the quarter. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter Earnings Bridge on Slide 7, price mix was a headwind as expected due to the prior index movements in North American packaging and global cellulose fibers. Volume was mixed, strong demand for corrugated packaging and pulp was offset by a sharp decline in demand for printing papers as stay-at-home measures accelerated. Operations and costs were favorable, our mills and converting plants performed well and we successfully managed through the incidents at Bogalusa and Rome. We also had the lower benefit cost of 40 million across the businesses that will not repeat in the second quarter. Input costs were also favorable driven by the lower energy distribution and chemical cost. Recovered fiber costs increased rapidly in the latter part of March as generation decreased, but it did not impact the first quarter materially. Corporate items and taxes were unfavorable due to one-time items. Equity earnings were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter before adjusting for $0.13 non-cash currency translation loss at Ilim. Turning to the segments and starting with industrial packaging on Slide 8. Our business performed well in the first quarter. We adjusted our system to meet our customer strong demand for packaging as COVID-19 containment measures accelerated in March. In North America we leveraged the scale and flexibility of our system to manage the impact of production losses in Bogalusa and Rome. Our converting facilities performed well in a rapidly changing environment to meet strong and often irregular customer demand. Our European packaging business delivered strong year-over-year earnings growth driven by margin recovery and the successful ramp up at the Madrid mill, which performed at a 100% despite challenging conditions. Across the segment price and mix was unfavorable due to the impact of prior index movement in North America as well as the mixed impact of higher container board exports. Volume improved sequentially driven by strong customer demand following COVID-19 stay-at-home measures. Export container board demand was strong across all regions. Operations and costs were favorable, mostly due to the non repeat of last quarter\u2019s positive LIFO inventory adjustment. The first quarter also includes $15 million in cost related to incidents of Bogalusa and Rome as well as the expected $20 million in cost related to the Riverdale conversion. Maintenance and outage costs increased sequentially. We did, however, adjust the scope and timing of planned outages in response to unplanned production losses and broader cash conservation initiatives. Input costs were favorable across the segment driven by lower energy and chemical costs. As mentioned earlier, recovered fiber costs rose rapidly in the latter part of the quarter due to significant dislocations to traditional channels. We expect recovered fiber to be a significant cost headwind in the second quarter. I would also note that we are extending the Riverdale conversion schedule to manage contractors staffing levels to ensure appropriate social distancing practices. The expected startup moves out at quarter to the third quarter of this year. Turning to Slide 9. Let\u2019s take a closer look at North American corrugated packaging segments and the impact we are seeing from COVID-19. Consumer behavior changed rapidly in response to containment measures. This resulted in immediate changes to packaging demands for our customers both positive and negative. I will just mentioned green obviously shows the benefits from some of the changes and red shows the unfavorable impact from some of the changes and our near-term outlook. Yellow indicates a moderating from elevated levels of demand as we are in April. We experienced strong initial demand in March and April, driven by processed food, proteins, chemicals, tissue and towel in e-commerce. Conversely, customer segments oriented toward this being non-essential as well as those with higher exposure to restaurants and food service experienced the sharp pullback in demand. The near-term outlook we provide on this slide is our best view of current demand across our segments. Keep in mind, the environment remains fluid and there is variability within the segment. Growth and processed food is stabilizing after strong initial customer demand. Consumer demand for meat and poultry remain strong. However, recent processing plant shutdowns are expected to slow demand for packaging in the near-term. Produce remains weak due to significant exposure to restaurants and food service. E-commerce is seeing unprecedented growth consumers, have greater reliance on e-commerce as a primary spending channel as a result of the containment measures. And lastly, we are seeing a sharp pullback in packaging for durable goods. Corrugated packaging plays a critical role in supply chain to brings essential products to consumers. We will continue to take care of our customers\u2019 changing needs as communities around the world start to ease containment measures. Turning to container board exports on Slide 10, demand remains strong and customer inventory levels are normal to low. Demand in Latin America and Europe is solid driven by resilient consumer demand for bananas and citrus. Demand in the Middle East and North Africa is solid but expected to slow as the citrus season ramps down. Demand in China is strong. Industries are restarting following COVID-19 closures and customer inventories are low. And then the rest of Asia, we see strong demand in the Philippines, which is focused on banana exports. Slide 11 recaps the status of Bogalusa and Rome following the incidence in March. As I mentioned earlier, we had a $15 million impact in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect a $30 million impact in the second quarter after the initial insurance recovery. We continue to access the full cost impact of these incidents and are working with our providers to determine the potential insurance recovery. Global cellulose fibers on Slide 12, we experienced very good demand as our customers responded to strong consumer demand for absorbent hygiene products and tissue products as a result of COVID-19. Across the segment, pricing mix was unfavorable due to the impact of prior index movement. Absorbent pulp shipments improved 13% year-over-year, driven by improved supply demand conditions and our successful customer contracts season in late 2019. Maintenance outage cost increased sequentially, for the full-year we will reduce the scope of planned outages and defer spending to preserve cash. Operations and cost management were strong and inputs were favorable. On Slide 13, let\u2019s take a closer look at our global cellulose fibers statements and the impact we are seeing from COVID-19. In absorbent pulp which represents about 75% of our mix, we experienced strong initial demand in March and April. All absorbent hygiene product categories were strong, although adult incontinence and sanitary wets saw particularly strong consumer demand. We expect strong demand for fluff pulp in the near-term. However, we could start to see the impact of lower consumption as the haters due to economic hardship, especially in emerging economies unfold. In market pulp which represents about 25% of our mix. We experienced strong initials demand in tissue and towel segments, and a sharp decline in printing papers. We expect recovered paper shortages to support demand for our virgin pulp in the near-term. However, we could see destocking of tissue and towel as containment measures ease. Looking at printing papers on Slide 14, the business delivered earnings of 96 million in the first quarter. Products and mix decrease due to the flow through from prior periods across the segment and weaker geographic mix in Latin America. Volume decreased sequentially. COVID-19 containment measures unprecedented demand declines in all regions which accelerated in March. Operations and cost management were solid, planned maintenance outages were executed well and at a lower cost than planned. Our North American business successfully managed the first quarter of operations without Riverdale 15 capacity, which had previously represented about 240,000 tons of printing papers per year. Input costs were favorable across the segment on lower fiber and chemical costs. On Slide 15 and we will take a closer look at printing paper segment and the impact we are seeing from COIVD-19. Across our regions we experienced an immediate and unprecedented declined in demand for a cut size as work-from-home and other containment measure is accelerated. We continue to work closely with our customers to support shifts to online and home delivery platforms by adapting packaging designs to meet customer\u2019s needs. We also experienced unprecedented decline in commercial printing segments due to the significant pullback in print advertising. The near-term outlook we provide on the slide is our best view of current demand across regions. We remain focused on optimizing cash and working capital and we will match or production to our customer\u2019s demand as we manage through a very challenging environment. Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 16, we had an equity loss of 35 million in the quarter, which includes a non-cash foreign exchange loss on Ilim\u2019s U.S dollars denominated net debt of which IPs after tax portion was 51 million or $0.13 per share. Volume was essentially flat sequentially, average price decrease on the flow through of prior period price movements as expected. Ilim, achieved record production in March on successful bottlenecking projects completed in 2019. Demand for softwood pulp in China is solid driven by consumer demand for towel and tissue products. We expect volatility in the ruble exchange rate to continue to due to fluctuations in global oil markets. As a reminder, operationally about 60% to 70% of Ilim\u2019s revenue is in U.S dollars. The Ilim committed to the health and safety of its employees and is practicing appropriate containment measures. The business has not had any material operational disruptions due to COVID-19 and lastly in April, International Paper received $141 million dividend payment from Ilim. This brings total dividends received from Ilim to more than $1 billion since the inception of the joint venture. Turning to Slide 17 in our outlook. In light of the uncertainty regarding the impact and duration of COVID-19 we are withdrawing our full-year adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow outlooks. We intend to continue to provide an update on business conditions and a quarterly outlook. Keep in mind that our second quarter outlook is our best view at this time in a fluid environment. So let me start with industrial packaging. We expect price and mix to be down $5 million on the flow through of prior index movements in North America, which is partly offset by favorable price and mix in our export channels. Volume is expected to be down $70 million as demand slows from an elevated level as well as the impact of one less shipping day in the second quarter. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $60 million due to the non-repeat of lower medical claims and higher costs related to the Rome mill in the second quarter. Same with industrial packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $27 million and input costs are expected to be higher by about $55 million due to higher recovered fiber cost. In global cellulose fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $20 million on the impact of prior index movements. Volume is expected to be sequentially flat. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $25 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $25 million and input costs are expected to remain stable. Moving to printing papers, we expect the impact of price and mix to be flat. Volume is expected to be down about $50 million due to the impact of COVID-19 in all of our regions. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $85 million mostly due to the impact of unabsorbed fix cost. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $12 million and input costs are expected to remain stable. As noted in the segment details, I just shared maintenance outages all-in are expected to improve by 64 million in the second quarter. Detail\u2019s by business and quarter are included in the appendix. In response to COVID-19, we now expect maintenance outage expense for the full-year to be about 480 million versus our original forecast of 585 million. And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see the elbow for the Ilim joint venture. Turning to Slide 18. I want to take a moment to update you on how we are thinking about capital allocations as we navigate COVID-19. Our allocation framework does not change. We will continue to make thoughtful choices as we navigate circumstances. I will start with the balance sheet. Our commitment to a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating does not change. We reduced debt by $1.5 billion during the past two years and closed 2019 around the upper end of our leverage targets. Our leverage could be adversely impacted if negative global economic conditions persists. But as Mark said earlier, we entered the COVID-19 crisis in a strong position. That strength extends to our pension plan. It remains sufficiently funded and previous actions to de-risk the plan help preserve the funding ratio at about 90% as we exited the first quarter. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the past five years we have returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders or about 60% of free cash flow. Given significant economic uncertainties, we are suspending share repurchases. We paid the first quarter dividend in March. We are not making a change to our dividend policy at this time. We continue to evaluate it with our Board of Directors as we conduct testing on the impact of COVID-19 under different economic scenarios. Looking at investments. We intend to reduce CapEx to 600 million in 2020.We will fund only mission critical needs, including the completion of the Riverdale conversion. We will not compromise the health and safety of our employees nor taking any environmental or regulatory shortcuts. We are taking a deliberate approach to funding decisions to ensure we continue to have the right capabilities to provide the best solutions for our customers and are well positioned for the essential economic recovery. Taking a closer look at debt and pension on Slide 19. Our maturity profile provides us with financial flexibility as we navigate through the crisis. We have no commercial paper debt outstanding and no near-term bond maturities. I would also note that we reduced our annual interest expense by about $100 million since 2017. As I have said earlier, our pension plan is sufficiently funded at around 90%. At this time, we do not expect any required contributions in the next five-years. During the past few years, we have taken meaningful steps to de-risk the pension plan on the structural basis. You see the results of these actions on the chart. Our pension gap is essentially unchanged as we exit the first quarter despite significant market volatility. Turning to Slide 20, we have about $3.8 billion of liquidity as we exit April, which includes cash of about $1 billion and committed credit facilities of $2.8 billion. We have taken prudent actions to further strengthening our liquidity as the COVID-19 crises accelerated. We entered a new $750 Million bank revolver. We also extended our AR facility and changed it from uncommitted to committed to ensure access. All our facilities are available and unused at this time. In addition, our credit ratings provide attractive access to the bond market. We like the financial flexibility, our what liquidity position provides given the severity of the economic crisis and the uncertainty of the shape and pace of recovery. On Slide 21 we summarize some of the cash levers available. Given the significant economic uncertainty, we chose to take prudent and early actions to maximize liquidity. We will continue to evaluate conditions and make decisions based on the best information available and our view of risk. As a reminder, we monetize $250 million of our stake in Graphic Packaging in the first quarter. This puts us on a monetization path and we will continue to be thoughtful on our approach. The net of all of this is that we are well positioned with our operations, balance sheet and liquidity to manage the current economic crisis. And with that I will turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Tim. We began today\u2019s conversation with by sharing with you how International Paper is navigating the COVID-19 crisis. We have weathered many storms during our Company\u2019s 122-years history and every day I hear another inspiring story of how our employees are stepping up to the current set of challenges, and I\u2019m proud of their steadfast commitment to International Paper, our customers and each other. Our Company plays a critical role in the supply chain required to produce and deliver food, pharmaceuticals, hygiene and other essential products to consumers. And as I said earlier, it is a privilege that comes with enormous responsibility to take care of our employees and our customers. They are the foundation of how we create value for our shareholders. I\u2019m confident that the Company we have built and our strong financial footing positions as well to succeed in the near-term and the long-term. And with that, Tim and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And thanks for all you are doing on COVID, both for us and your employees. A couple of questions to start. Mark could you talk a bit about what kind of growth you are seeing in e-commerce, either in the quarter or you know maybe the current run rate as we are in April. And then related point, what kind of volumes are you in fact seeing in box shipments to extent that you can comment in April and I have a couple of follow-on. Mark Sutton : George, this is Mark. On e-commerce, normally we talk double-digit growth. We are experiencing extremely strong double-digit growth, so orders of magnitude above the normal double-digit growth. And in April, our indications through April are that we are still seeing although moderated from the heading March that we showed at 4.7 to more normalized levels, we are still seeing a positive activity in the box market in April in the neighborhood of 2%. George Staphos : Okay. Thanks for that. And then recognizing some of this is just going to be driven by COVID and social distancing. Can you comment on where you found the opportunity to cut back a bit on both capital spending and maintenance on the latter, it seemed a fair amount of that was on North American industrial packaging. And if you can provide a little bit more color in terms of what can be cut permanently and what gets utilized pushed into 2021? Mark Sutton : Yes. George I\u2019m going to make just an opening comment and ask Tim to give you a little more color. On capital and maintenance expenses, we make these decisions from a principle basis. Number one, and we often get credit, where the credit is the right word, not for having really good assets and spending a lot of money maintaining them. Our asset quality is really high and we are not operating typically in crisis mode. So our ability to adjust and I don\u2019t think of it as cutting, I think of it as delaying, adjusting, changing the timing of CapEx and maintenance expenses. We were allowed to do that, managing the risk because we keep our equipment and our processes in very good shape. So there is a number of areas that we are just looking at before we really understand what is going to happen to the consumer, GDP and demand that we don\u2019t tie up cash in projects in areas that we may not need to as early as we originally planned. And Tim, if you want to give some additional examples. Tim Nicholls : Well I think you just said it well Mark, the only thing I would add is and Mark referenced it. That this is not - so much as waiting and see. So all of the measures that we have taken, we can begin ramping them back up as we see less volatility and a return some type of normal. So, but I think Mark characterized it well, we do have great assets. It gives us flexibility. Mark Sutton : An example, just to give you a little more George. We have cost reduction projects every year. Most of that is related to consumption of input materials. So any type of input trying to be more efficient, consume less of it. In an uncertain economic environment, those projects don\u2019t pay as early as you think if you are not using that input anyway, because of low demand. So until we have better clarity, we can change the cash outflow timetable and end up keeping the Company\u2019s cash-in and cash-out in a much stronger position. And that is really all we are doing here. George Staphos : Okay. And it sounds like it is more proactive than just social distancing. Thanks for that. And my last one, could you comment a bit further on Bogalusa and Rome, what do you think the production loss for the year might be. You gave some preliminary timing for the restart at Rome. If you could go into what is required there, that would be great. Thanks for taking my questions. I will turn it over. Tim Nicholls : Yes, Bogalusa started back up and running and Rome we are looking at June as the likely restart. So we are going to lose a quarter in Rome. We lost much less than that at Bogalusa. We don\u2019t typically give out capacity numbers and things like that George. So I will refrain from that. George Staphos : Yes, understood. I figured in this circumstance you could, but I appreciate it guys. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. And thank you for the very helpful presentation slides and all the actions you are taking for your constituents. The one thing I was trying to get a better understanding is on those volumes side in industrial packaging. I think you said a negative $70 million hit. And I think you also indicated that in April, box shipments were looking like they are up about 2% domestically. And I realized that there is international as well as domestic in here, but if I look at the slide for just ended quarter, you had like an 18 million benefit from volume. It just seems like a very large negative, expected impact from that? Can you help me understand why it would be quite as big as that unless you are expecting, a very sharp fall off which I don\u2019t necessarily get from the slides you put in volume for the second quarter. Tim Nicholls : Hey, Mark, it is Tim. You are right. April has been very good. Our cut-off is between 2% and 3%. That is not a shipment number. That is the consumption as we as we produce boxes to satisfy orders. But we will know what shipments look like of course, until we close the books at the end of the month and see all of that. There is some uncertainty in Europe as Europe starts to reopen. And I think it is unfortunately is just where we are. There is a lot of fluidity and uncertainty around everything. Three or four days ago, we have protein packaging plants being down and now they are going to be coming back. And so that is just how quickly things can change. We do have one to one less day in the quarter in the second quarter in North America. So that has a not insignificant impact. But we are looking at what we are seeing in the moment. We are a short order cycle business. We can only really gauge on order intake out a couple of weeks. So we are just trying to triangulate across all these segments, segment-by-segment as to what we think we are going to see in May and June. Mark Sutton : So Mark, just one added piece of color. If you go back to the slide with the market segments for box that Tim walked us through with the red, yellow and green. Again, our best view right now as multiple states and jurisdictions attempt to try reopening strategies. We didn\u2019t have a view of whether that was going to be successful or not. But let\u2019s assume part of it is more successful than we are all carrying in our hedge. You have got flow through in food service and some of the other weak segments, that would be all upside to. As we sit here today, none of that has happened. So trying to call it, we just try to be very transparent and say this is what we see now. But as Tim mentioned on the protein plants and I think they will figure that out, and on successful reopening. And then anything else that gives the consumer confidence, therapeutics that were reported earlier this week with some traction, those are all of us, that could give us upside in the demand cycle. But to put that out there, as we see it in International Paper, seems to be a little bit of wishful thinking, but all of it is moving and real and could be upsize to our near-term outlook. Mark Weintraub : I appreciate that. And just real quickly, if I could. Obviously white paper costs are moving really fast, or OCC is moving really fast. Can you give us a sense as to where you see them currently? And how that flows through into your business. And what if anything can you be doing to mitigate the impact if you have got a big collection system et cetera? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Well they are significantly three or four times what they were earlier in the year. The good news is we have tremendous flexibility across our system. So we do have some facilities that are 100% recycled, but most of our facilities are a blend of virgin and recovered fiber. And so on a normal basis, we go about some amount of balancing and arbitraging cost facility-by-facility. So we will have some flexibility to work around that, but again it depends on with the reopening. It depends on how fast and what degree because this is really a generation issue where certain parts of the supply chain for OCC have been impacted quite negatively. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi Group. Anthony Pettinari : So thanks again for all the detail, especially with what you are doing on safety. Maybe just following up on George\u2019s question. You know, it seems like this experience may accelerate e-commerce and e-grocery at the expense of physical retail. If that is true, how do you think about the long-term impact to your corrugated business either from your ability to engage those customers and then any difference in the margin profile? If there is any difference from some of the other traditional customers you serve. Mark Sutton : Anthony it is a great question. We are well positioned to serve e-commerce where it is business to consumer, both in the general retail sense and e-commerce that is business-to-business I mean more industrial products. As we have a position with almost everybody who is anybody in that particular type of business model. We have product and service platforms that do very well in there. And I think the margin comparisons are not a big issue. Some of the retail is replacing lower margin retail. Some of the food through e-commerce is replacing some of the average margin in the process of center store stuff. So when you are looking at it all, e-commerce is a good business for us and it is not a margin arbitrage issue that we look at in the long-term. Tim Nicholls : And relative to the total size of the market, it is still relatively small as the segment and the segments not homogeneous. E-commerce is not e-commerce as we look at the customers that we supply. Anthony Pettinari : Great. That is very helpful. And then in printing papers, I think you anticipate essentially stable price mix in to 2Q. Just wondering with demand down 40% globally wanting to gauge whether the shutdowns that are being taken are sort of appropriate to balance supply to demand and then, as you move from March, April to May, are you seeing sequential weakening or stabilization in printing paper demand. Any kind of thoughts there? Tim Nicholls : You know it is like we said when we covered it on with 40% to 50% lower, order intake is as we said it unprecedented. So again, these are short order cycle businesses and we don\u2019t have - unless it is an export shipment which has a little bit longer lead time, you don\u2019t get tremendous look through to what it might be a month or two months out. We are going to have to see how - I think it is going to be a function of how quickly and how successfully things reopened. And we are taking all of the steps we need to take to match our productive capacity to our customer\u2019s demands. The last thing we want to do is, as we referenced earlier is high cash where we don\u2019t need it. And so it is better for us to adjust our productive footprint in the short-term than then tie it up in inventory. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That is helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Steven Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thank you. good morning everyone. First of all, do you anticipate, I think you do. Future insurance recoveries from the outages at Rome and Bogalusa. As Tim said that there were initial recoveries. So maybe what is deductible and how much more can we perhaps expect? Tim Nicholls : Yes we have a 10 million deductible in each of the mills for the two incidents. We are just going to have to wait and see how it plays out. This is still an ongoing process. So we will have more to say about as in future quarter\u2019s results. Steve Chercover : Okay, and sticking with container board. I guess the implications we see had suggested that you were perhaps trying to fast track the Riverdale conversion in order to offset the impact at Rome and Bogalusa. I mean, I think it is fine that you are doing it safely and it is even a quarter push backwards. But, was that just pure speculation on their part? Where did they get that? Tim Nicholls : I have no idea where they get it. It wouldn\u2019t even be accurate in terms of greater product. Because we are going to be producing totally different product in Riverdale and other two mills. So I can\u2019t speak to what they write or how they obtain it. We are just managing the project. We are trying to protect our employees and our contractors and do it in a very responsible way. Steve Chercover : Sure, okay. Well, we don\u2019t always know where they get their stuff. And then a longer term, if you can think about it view on paper. Is it possible that post-COVID like there might be many other long-term impacts that we are not anticipating? For instance, e-commerce might have a permanent boost, might there be a permanent negative shock to printing paper demand? Tim Nicholls : It could be. I wouldn\u2019t argue that something is not possible. We just don\u2019t know. Just anecdotally, I try to reframe from printing as I work remotely at home but then I found myself printing two rings at a time to catch up with all the things that I would normally print. So, it depends. We know on the print advertising side that still a combination of online platform marketing and direct mail marketing is the most successful type of marketing approach. So, we will have to see what happens as things start to open up again. Steve Chercover : And last question on fine paper. And it is your specialties. Don\u2019t you make a lot of the course for tip swabs for instance? Are there any benefits on your specialty side? Tim Nicholls : Yes, we do make those. This is much smaller products. So the amount fiber is much less. But yes we do make those, we are maybe the only at this point, but we are one of the few producers that actually make it. Steve Chercover : Okay, thanks. That helps me. Tim Nicholls : Thank you too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Debbie Jones, Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you touched this before, could you just give a little bit more granular on what you are seeing in the export markets and if there is anything notable by region and kind of how things are trending right now and what you expect in May? Tim Nicholls : Yes. The summary comment is really relatively strong across all of the products and reasons that we ship to both for export container board as well as our pulp business. Pulp on the strength of hygiene products, and some towel and tissue. And on container board remember, inventories were much lower as we entered the year and demand has actually been good to this point. And so, we think the inventory levels and customers around the world that we service are normal and best and loyal in some cases. And the poll for banana and citrus has been strong. Debbie Jones : Okay. And then I wanted to ask you a question about the dividends. You mentioned the Board reviewing it. Could you talk about what goes into that? My thought would be that you looking at the first half of the year, in a performance in fine and you are taking a lot of steps at the balance sheet and CapEx, but you shouldn\u2019t be in a difficult position. But what kind of stress testing are you doing at this point? Tim Nicholls : It is a great question. And as I said, there is no change to our dividend policy. We paid the dividend in the first quarter, no change to the policy at the time, but with all prudence, for not only for dividend, but for all aspects of our operation we are doing, as robust economic scenario planning is as we know how. Starting with the impact that we saw during the financial crisis back in 2008, 2009 and then working to lower levels of performance from that experience. We don\u2019t know, given this is a different type of crisis with health implications, we don\u2019t know how severe it can be. So we are looking at a whole range of testing and scenario planning and trying to be as robust as we know how. I would say this, in terms of the actions that we have taken, they have been taken out of caution and prudence and because we have flexibility to lower capital and lower maintenance, because of the asset quality, we just stopped for a moment in time. We can always resume if things appear normal. So there is an amount of sequence of the cash mitigation levers that we have. The ones we have taken so far are ones that we can turn back on if we want to. But we thought in the moment back in March as things accelerated, it was very uncertain. These were prudent things to do at that point in time. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks, that is helpful. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Mark one on demand, I know Mark asked you earlier about that the 70 million delta, but just more broadly, I know you look at a number of economic indicators, whether it be GDP growth or non-durable industrial production or otherwise, and there has historically been about I think 150 basis point gap between GDP growth and box demand. Just wondering how you are thinking about that relationship this year, just given how unusual, obviously the first quarter was particularly March and April was good as well. Box demand was likely much, much better than what the actual economy was doing. So how are you thinking about that relationship this year in the context of what you saw in 1Q up about 3% and then you were up to 2-ish in April? Mark Sutton : It is a great question Adam. We do have a demand model that we use for International Paper. It is not only looking at GDP, but the construct of GDP and then some other inputs that correlate very closely with corrugated demand. And we use that model under different scenarios of GDP put out by others. Not in our own number, but well recognized external sources. And then when we look at for this particular disruption, you are right, it is different. It is a lot about the duration of the disruption. And we look at what we think recovery patterns will be not one letter in the alphabet, but by segments. And it is likely to play out differently by different types of segments. So, what role the consumer plays in the largest part of corrugated packaging, which is in the food and non-durables section really determines what we are going to see in demand. And that may be for several quarters be completely dislocated from the broader GDP, if that is being driven down by capital investment, or other components of GDP. So we are not looking at a delta or an offset to GDP and then calculating historic relationship for box demand. It is much more granular than that. And one of the biggest sources of input we have to our demand model is actually talking to our customers and seeing what they are seeing. And that is why we think for the kinds of products we make and the role they play in the supply chain through an environment like this. This isn\u2019t a bunch of luxury products that are you can buy or not buy. Most of what we do is essential to everyday life. And so we believe we are going to weather all these dramatic forecasting GDP pretty well. Adam Josephson : I appreciate that Mark. And one on recovered paper. I know you talked about the expected sequential drag in industrial packaging from higher OCC cost. I\u2019m just wondering embedded in that if you are expecting another, call it 20 to 30 bucks jump in the price in May and then what if anything thereafter? And then more broadly, how long do you expect this spike to last? I know it depends on how long the economy is effectively shut down for and how long commercial collection stays down for. But any thoughts you have about how much you are expecting OCC to go up again in May? And then where you think it shakes out thereafter based on how quickly the economy reopens. Tim Nicholls : You know I think it is just as we call it out. We are expecting a $55 million impact on higher input costs. Most of that being recovered fiber in the quarter. And I think you said it. I think it depends on how quickly and to what degree the shape of the reopening takes. And retail has been significantly impacted unless it was non-essential, restaurant, food service segment has been significantly impacted. So I think it is going to depend on how quickly and how successfully those come back. Mark Sutton : Adam another point on this to add to what Tim said is, this retail component is really going to be interesting to watch, because around almost 30% of OCC generated in the U.S. begins its life as a box being imported to the U.S. from somewhere else. Many of those type of products end up through the U.S. retail chains and they are definitely impacted right now. And not all of them are in that essential category. So again, duration of the stay-at-home orders, the confidence of consumers getting back into society, whether there is medicines and other treatments, all of that fits together. But there is a full almost 30% of our recovery fiber that is available for recovery in the U.S. that begins somewhere else. And that is really ratcheted down a lot right now. And likely will take a while to come back. Adam Josephson : Thanks so much, Mark. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with BMO. Mark Wilde : Hi, Mark, hi Tim. Tim Nicholls : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wonder if either of you could just give us a sense of how you are responding to these declines in printing and writing paper consumption in the various regions around the world? I think you produce in the U.S., Brazil, Poland and Russia. Mark Sutton : Mark I think the way we are responding is we are taking care of our customers. We are managing inventory very closely to Tim\u2019s point about not tying up cash and we have got a very flexible system in Europe and in the U.S., not along individual mills left in that business, but they are large and important. And for the same reasons we usually talk about it in packaging. When we have supply and demand dislocations, we have got the same marginal cost shedding model and systems in place. We just don\u2019t use it very much in printing papers. And we were able to shed a big portion of our marginal costs and variable costs to match our production with our demand. And so we are setup to do it but we take care of our customers and we take care of our inventory and cash tied up there and we adjust our production. Mark Wilde : So Mark, both of you are two biggest competitors domestically has sort of put out press releases and told us what they expected to pull out of the market in the second quarter. Is it possible for you to give us anything like that either domestically or for the offshore businesses? Mark Sutton : No, it is not. But we did give you a cost number in the outlook slide Tim walked through, I think it was $80 million, $85 million of unabsorbed fixed costs. And so that gives you some indication of what we are expecting. But no, we never give forward views of our plan production output. We just don\u2019t do that. Tim Nicholls : Do quantify after the fact every quarter. Mark Wilde : The other question I got is that for either of you, can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about kind of foreign exchange and the strength of the dollar? And I\u2019m curious about this both from a translational standpoint, but also the impact, for a largely a U.S dollar based producer of dollar denominated commodities. You know, what it means in terms of both a potential for kind of demand and price? Tim Nicholls : Yes, it is a great question Mark. You know it just strengthened some at the beginning of the crisis, it has been roughly the same zone for a few weeks now, maybe a month or two. We tend to get a bit of a wash around the world. When you look at our different businesses, a weak AI relative to dollar helps that business, the export markets. The Ilim joint venture has all of its costs for the most part in rubles and it is exporting and selling in dollars for us to some degree at times depending on the strength of demand and supply, on exports from the U.S. But again, a lot of, what gets exported out of U.S. is in our pulp business, which is a unique product and benefits from the fiber characteristics that we have in the Southern part of the U.S. So when we put it all together over a long period of time it seem to be mostly net neutral. Mark Wilde : Okay. Just a last quick one Tim, can you just update us on Ilim\u2019s capital plans? Tim Nicholls : Yes. In this environment you would expect that they would pull it back. They have taken some measures to cut capital in the moment. They are still progressing on the large project that is [indiscernible] on and don\u2019t see any real significant delays to that, but they have other places to balance out capital spending across the rest of the business as well as that business is particularly good at managing their cash and taking any cash mitigation measures that they need to. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fair enough. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Gabe Hajde : Mark, Tim Guillermo. Thanks for detail. And hope you guys are all doing well. Mark Sutton : Thanks Gabe. Gabe Hajde : I was curious if you could comments at all. Tim you touched on some I think export customer inventory levels, but maybe your domestic inventory levels in the industrial business. And I appreciate there is a balancing act going on right now with bringing up foreign facility Bogalusa, another one being out for June. But demand kind of plays out as you see it, or as you are projecting where you might expect your inventory levels to be at the end of the second quarter versus where you are at today? Tim Nicholls : You know I guess what I would say, as you know, we don\u2019t publish or share our specific numbers and levels. I would say we are on the low side here domestically. We have had a strong demand pull across the entire business all channels so far this year given the factors that we talked about. So, low inventory levels and a lot of demand through this point in time that we have seen in the export channel. And you have seen the results that we had in the integrated channel here in North America. And so to this point it has been about balancing our supply to make sure we are trying to take care of all of our customers. At the end of the second quarter I wouldn\u2019t venture a prediction at this point. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And maybe just try to dig a little bit deeper on Adam\u2019s question. Kind of on Slide 9. Mark, you talked about trying to get in the lead a little bit in terms of underlying demand drivers for corrugate. As we think about maybe corrugated intensity through the supply chain for food and beverage specifically going through retail as appose to food service. Is there a way that maybe high level you can help us think about is it more corrugate intensive for that channel versus and I appreciate again you don\u2019t necessarily know what your customers do with the product once it leaves your facility? Mark Sutton : I understand your questions Gabe. I don\u2019t have a good clean answer to corrugated intensity per unit of output. But just sufficed to say that both channels, the retail channel, which doesn\u2019t - it is corrugated intensely, but as you know, there has been a lot of innovations with beverage and other things that don\u2019t use as much anymore. And the foodservice channels are very, very important to our corrugated demand. I would say, the food service channel given the way product moves and the bulk in which it moves in the quantities, has a very large component of corrugated. You think about even anecdotally, if you think about watching a restaurant get supplies from the backside as the food service truck is there. There is a lot of corrugated delivering multiple units of ingredients and supplies. So it is definitely important for our demand. And it is important for coordinated usage. And so as we see some success in reopening even at reduced capacities. It is not just restaurants though, of course schools and cafeterias and other things are large users of the foodservice supply chain as well. But it is meaningfully important for us. Gabe Hajde : Okay, thank you. Good luck. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Just two things. Riverdale obviously represents a nice opportunity to bring all that high value board in-house. Are your white top customers any more or less essential in corporate terms in average, I\u2019m just wondering how to think about the customer side of that ramp up. Tim Nicholls : Hey Mark, it is Tim. A large portion of what we produce is around food. So, whether it is produce or other types of food products a lot of the usage flight top goes into that. So without giving you a hard number, I don\u2019t have a hard number off the top of my head, but there is a big component to consumer goods and food products. Mark Connelly : Okay. So shouldn\u2019t see too much of a drag there. Just one more question, a little more decent on Brazil. Can you remind us what the split of business down there is in terms of cut size versus roll and how much of that business stays domestic Brazil lately? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Roughly half of our production of memory serve stays in Brazil. And then it varies up and down. The balance of it does either to the Latin American region and some amount to Europe. The split, it is largely a cut size business. We have a predominant brand in the country [indiscernible] that is very well received by our customer base. We do some printing grades as well, but for the most part a lot of cut size. Mark Connelly : Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our last question for the day will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in, hope you all are doing well. I just wanted to take another stab at the 2Q, sort of volume out looking corrugated, just trying to reconcile a couple of conflicting statements, kind of like April is off to a good start on a year-over-year basis, the heat map sort of showed some deceleration, I\u2019m guessing as the month progress, but then the guidance on EBIT again down 70 million or so. Just wondering if that is kind of representing your worst case estimate for how things could progress in 2Q, if things maybe deteriorate even more from here or you know is it something you are actually seeing? I guess just trying to get a sense of how conservative you are taking a cut at the 2Q guide and just sort of related to that, I understand pulling the full-year guidance, but why even give the 2Q numbers if so much is sort of up in the air and uncertain at this point? Tim Nicholls : That is a good question Brian. We always give an outlook. We are required to give an outlook. We try to give one as thoughtful as we can. I would say April looks like it is turning out okay. We will have to get into May and see, again, I continue this and that we are a short order cycle business. And so a lot of this is triangulating based on what we hear from customers and what we are seeing across all of the converting facilities that we have and looking at it segment-by-segment-by segment. So it is our best estimate at this moment in time, but I think it is acknowledging that there is a lot of fluidity. And as I mentioned with the protein example, one day it looks like 25%, 30% of supply is going to be constrained, the demand is there, but the supply is not. And then a few days later, there is changes in place and protein plants will hopefully be starting back up at a point in time. So just a lot of fluidity. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then just one last one just to switch gears maybe more of a philosophical or a longer term question on credit free sheet. You know, obviously it is going to be off quite a bit this year and someone alluded to earlier some of that could be structural longer term in nature. Meanwhile your corrugated business is performing well. Just wondering how you are think about the interplay between the two in the industry the potential for others, you talked about conversions from printing papers to packaging to maybe look to move forward on some of those as they need to shut some mills. And then, your role as a leader in both markets. Do you guys view yourself as somebody who would look to proactively preemptively shut some more of your white paper capacity to try and keep others in the industry from trying to move towards a conversion mentality. Mark Sutton : So, Brian, I mean, that is difficult question to answer. Because it is so forward-looking. I think, if you look at our track record on how we have managed our uncoated free sheet business over the years. It has been a combination of how we match the supply side to a structurally declining market. It is a mix of converting some facilities to a different product that were already in like container board and fluff pulp. Unfortunately, we closed some facilities that didn\u2019t have a good conversion options. And we have managed the business in I think a graceful way to meet the reality of the decline. All the other parts of your question are really unanswerable in terms of what we would do and why. We would do things and have done things with our printing paper assets and especially talented production pieces we have at those plans to proactively help one of our other businesses. That would be the primary reason for making changes. And so it is really early to figure out right now whether there is a permanent structural step down and then a return to a steady structural declines or not. It is a good question. It is possible that could happen. But we are going to stay flexible enough to make sure we see what is happening before, before we make any conclusions on that. But, our uncoated free sheet business is now less than 20% of the company. It generates strong cash. We have got great assets and good wood baskets that give us flexibility for the future. So that that message hasn\u2019t really changed. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks so much. Stay safe guys. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will turn it over to Guillermo Gutierrez. Mark Sutton : Thank you, operator, this is Mark and I\u2019m going to wrap up. First of all, I just want to again, publicly thank our employees in International Paper for their courage and commitment to our company and to our customers and to each other as we operate through this. We think there is obviously more uncertainty as communities reopen their economies. Our hope is that that is done well and successful. That will help the people around the world and will also help our Company. The crisis has done one thing for us, we talk a lot about purpose of our Company. Making products that people need every day on renewable, natural resources. And that just really brought our purpose to life, reinforces the critical role our products played in people\u2019s lives and in the important supply chains. And I will leave you with International Paper, and my confidence in our future. We have a strong financial footing. you can count on International Paper to deliver, you can count on our employees if you invest in International Paper, you can count on us to create long-term value and lead the Company and manage the Company with all of our important stakeholders in mind for the long-term. We have been at it for 122-years, and we are going to plan on being at it for a lot longer. So thank you for joining our call and we look forward to talking with you in the future. Operator : Thank you. Once again, we would like to thank you for participating on today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of the presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation to those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter 2020 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide 3. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be unlike anything we've experienced and requires us to focus on what we need to do to remain strong and resilient for all our stakeholders in the short term as well as the long term. And as you can see from our results that's exactly what we're doing. We delivered solid earnings and strong free cash flow in the second quarter, again demonstrating the strength of International Paper. Through the first half of the year, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow through strong commercial and operational performance, as well as outstanding cost management across all of our businesses. As you would expect, demand and recovery trends vary greatly by business and end-use consumer segment. Overall, demand for corrugated packaging in fluff pulp continues to be resilient and is outpacing what you would expect in the general economic backdrop. Our North America box shipments were flat in the second quarter compared to last year and we saw continued strong demand for fluff pulp. However, we've seen a substantial decline in demand for Printing Papers across all geographic regions due to work from home and school disruptions. Against this backdrop, our commercial teams are doing a tremendous job with our customers to ensure that we meet their changing needs. And our manufacturing and supply chain teams continue to leverage the scale and flexibility of our system to deliver strong operational performance and optimize costs across our businesses. All of this contributed to the company's solid performance in the second quarter. I'll turn to slide 4 now, which shows some of the specifics of our second quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.77 per share and this included a favorable Ilim FX non-cash impact of $0.09 in the quarter. Overall, our teams did a tremendous job managing through the current environment. Looking at sales, the majority of the sequential decrease is attributed to the decline in demand for Printing Papers. And as I said earlier, we generated strong free cash flow in the second quarter, bringing free cash flow to $1 billion for the first half of the year. We continue to apply cash consistent with our capital allocation framework, to maintain a strong balance sheet, return cash to shareowners and invest to create value. We will remain focused on cash generation and continue to be thoughtful in how we use cash as we manage through the ongoing uncertainty. Turning to slide 5. As I said last quarter, International Paper entered the COVID-19 pandemic in a position of strength and it all starts with our employees. I'm really proud of their ongoing commitment to take care of first each other and our customers. I want to take this opportunity once again to thank them and especially our frontline teams for their ability to not only adapt to the challenging environment to perform -- but to perform at a really high level even with reconfigured work systems that align with the highest COVID-19 health practices. I'm also proud of the work we're doing to support the critical needs in our communities including our donation of corrugated boxes to agencies -- agencies that deliver essential food and supplies. As we look ahead, we're starting to see some recovery in our markets as economies around the world begin to reopen. Having said that, uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the economic impact of COVID-19 persists. We'll continue to navigate these uncertain times by staying focused on the health and well-being of our employees, taking care of our customers and ensuring that the company has a strong financial foundation through each phase of the crisis. Now, I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance, as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank You, Mark. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide 6, operating earnings improved by $0.20 to $0.77 per share as we executed well on the things that we control. Price and mix was favorable, mostly due to improved pricing in export containerboard and fluff pulp from trough levels. Volume was unfavorable with demand trends varying greatly by business and region. Demand for corrugated packaging and fluff pulp was resilient even as we stepped down from initial surge demand in the later flatter part of the first quarter. In Printing Papers, we experienced a substantial drop in demand across all geographic regions due to COVID-19 containment measures. Operations and costs were impacted by unabsorbed fixed costs, largely in our papers business as we matched our production to our customers' demand. Given the environment in which we are operating, the business did an excellent job managing costs and delivering strong operational performance at our mills and converting facilities. By executing well in the areas we control, we partly offset the impact of significant economic downtime in our Paper's business. Maintenance outage costs were favorable as planned. I'd note that the second quarter is our lowest maintenance outage quarter this year. Input costs were unfavorable with higher-recovered fiber costs, partly offset by lower wood and energy costs. Corporate expenses were favorable, and the effective tax rate was lower sequentially as expected. And lastly, equity earnings were favorable quarter-over-quarter, even after excluding the noncash currency translation gain at Ilim. Turning to the segments, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on slide 7. Our business performed well in the second quarter. Across the segment, price and mix was favorable, mostly due to higher export containerboard prices and improved geographic mix in our North American business as well as higher prices in our European business. This was partly offset by the impact of prior index movement in North America. Volume decreased sequentially as demand slowed from elevated levels in the first quarter and one less shipping day in North America. Corrugated packaging demand in North America remains resilient and is outpacing the economic backdrop, whereas demand in Europe is seeing a decline from COVID-19 measures. Export containerboard demand remained strong across all regions in the second quarter, and customer inventory levels are normal as we enter the seasonally slower third quarter. Performance in our mills and converting facilities was strong, and we manage direct and indirect costs very well. We also benefited from about $10 million in onetime items as well as lower start-up costs in Riverdale as we shifted the start-up to the third quarter. Maintenance outage costs improved sequentially as planned. You may recall that we adjusted the scope and timing of our maintenance outages to further optimize our system and conserve cash as part of our COVID-19 plan. Input costs were unfavorable with significantly higher average recovered fiber cost in the second quarter, which was partly offset by lower wood, energy and distribution costs. Finally, just a quick update on our North American containerboard mill system, the Bogalusa and Row mill started back up in the second quarter as planned. We did have an insurance recovery of $30 million in the quarter, but we also have higher costs related to the downtime. And so it was about a wash in the quarter between insurance and incremental cost. And finally, the Riverdale 15 conversion is now completed and start-up is planned later this quarter. Turning to slide 8, let's take a closer look at North American corrugated packaging segments and the near-term trends as we exit July. We're seeing resilient demand for corrugated packaging as cities and states slowly reopen. We're also seeing a modest improvement in segments with greater exposure to food service. The near-term outlook is our best view of current demand across our segments. Keep in mind, the environment remains fluid. Within the segments, demand for processed foods is normalizing as consumers return to more frequent shopping activity. Consumer demand for beef, pork and poultry is strong and processing plants are returning to normal capacity. We have an overweight position in protein where we've invested to establish advantaged capabilities. We're seeing a modest improvement in fresh produce and beverage as restaurants and food service activity slowly reopened. We continue to see very strong double-digit growth in e-commerce, with increased consumer reliance on e-commerce as suspending channel. We have a deliberate overweight strategy in e-commerce with advantaged capabilities and geographic reach. And in durable goods, we're seeing a modest improvement, although from very low levels. The challenges surrounding COVID-19 reinforced the critical role of corrugated packaging to bring essential products to consumers. Our team remains focused on understanding and meeting our customers' challenges and needs as they adapt to their supply chains in response to the massive disruptions due to the pandemic. On slide 9, as we navigate COVID-19, we continue to position the company for success in the near-term and the long term. That means investing strategically to enhance our capabilities and further strengthen our Industrial Packaging business. We're doing that through Greenfield box plants such as our recent Mexico box plant investment, by investing in capabilities and converting capacity in our North American box system to support growing segments and regions and through creative equity partnerships that expand our containerboard channels. All of which is aimed at growing our North American channels profitably.  Let me share a couple of recent examples. In the second quarter, we increased our ownership interest in a sheet feeder with a strong box plant network in North America. This investment allows us to expand sales through the channel by 140,000 tons annually by providing a broad range of containerboard solutions.  We also made a decision to increase capital investments in our North American box system by about $60 million this year to enhance capabilities and converting capacity to support growing customer segments and geographies. It is our view that value creation starts with understanding the needs of our customers through their value chain to the end consumer. With that in mind, our investments have clear commercial objectives and attractive returns. Turning to slide 10. I want to provide an update on the progress we're making in our EMEA packaging business. Our objective is to bring this business back to sustainable mid-teen margins and generate returns above our cost of capital.  As you can see through the first half of this year, we've improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $45 million compared with last year. The Madrid mill is an important catalyst. We're building advantage by integrating world-class lightweight recycled containerboard with our box network in Southern Europe to provide customers with a broader array of packaging solutions.  Our recent converting acquisitions in Europe are performing well and delivering returns ahead of our investment outlook. They also provide additional integration opportunities with the Madrid mill. And more importantly, they've enhanced our commercial capabilities and geographic reach in the region.  We're also making meaningful progress in our box system performance with more opportunity ahead. All of our plants have clear commercial and operational plans and we're leveraging the skills and resources from across the company to deliver on our commitments. The near-term path may be more challenging due to COVID-19, but our objectives and commitment are clear.  Turning to Global Cellulose fibers on slide 11. Price and mix was favorable and improved pricing across all regions. Volume was stable with mix of about 75% fluff pulp. Operations and costs were unfavorable overall. Strong operational performance and cost management was offset by non-repeat of favorable onetime items in the first quarter. Maintenance outage costs improved as planned. Through the first half of the year, we completed about 25% of our planned maintenance spending in the business.  Taking a closer look at demand. The demand impact of COVID-19 in the first half of the year we experienced some pull forward and demand for fluff pulp as customers managed supply chain risk to support strong consumer demand. In market pulp the initial surge in consumer demand for tissue and toggle normalized and some destocking was evident in the latter part of the second quarter. Overall, the underlying consumer demand for absorbent hygiene products as well as towel and tissue remains resilient as we work through the puts and takes of the pulp supply chain needs of our customers.  Turning to Printing Papers on slide 12. We experienced a short decline in demand across all of our regions. Across the segment price and mix was stable while the volume decrease impacted both the cut size and commercial printing channels. Operations and costs was impacted by unabsorbed fixed costs as we matched our production to our customers' demand across all geographic regions. Operational performance and cost management was strong and maintenance outages were well executed.  Despite a challenging earnings quarter, the business continued to generate positive cash flows by focusing on cost management and working capital. We exited the quarter with inventories at our target range based on the current demand environment. Looking ahead, our team will continue to focus on what we can control with three guiding principles : one matching our production to our customers' demand; two, meeting our customers' changing needs; and three, focusing on cash and working capital.  In recent weeks we've seen an uptick in order entry for North America as the economy reopens. However, significant uncertainty remains as work from all measures persist and school reopening's remain unclear. There are also some early signs of improvement in print advertising but clearly from very depressed levels. And although it's too soon to know the longer-term impact, our review is that the recovery in papers could be drawn out. Looking at Ilim results on slide 13. We had equity earnings of $63 million in the quarter. This includes a non-cash foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt of which IP's after-tax portion was $34 million or $0.09 per share. Volume was higher mostly due to improved softwood pulp demand in China and other export markets in the second quarter. Average sales price also improved slightly for softwood pulp in China. Wood costs were seasonally higher and maintenance outage costs were also higher sequentially.  So now I'll turn to the outlook on Slide 14. We continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain environment as economies around the world reopen and consumers adjust their purchasing and consumption behaviors. As we move into the third quarter, we see resilient demand for packaging, which should benefit from food service reopening's, although still at a modest pace. Underlying consumer demand for absorbent hygiene products remains solid but we do expect some inventory destocking for fluff pulp, as supply chains normalize. In Printing Papers, we've seen early signs of improvement from severely depressed levels. From an operations standpoint, we plan a sizable step-up in maintenance outages across the businesses as well as higher Riverdale start-up costs in the third quarter. So taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to be down $25 million on the flow-through of prior index movements in North America, lower price and mix in European packaging, as well as the impact of seasonal box mix in North America. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $50 million, due to higher costs related to the Riverdale start-up, higher seasonal costs in our North American box business and the non-repeat of one-time items in the second quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $44 million and input costs are expected to improve by $25 million on lower recovered fiber cost. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $10 million on the impact of prior index movement. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million due to lower seasonal demand and inventory destocking. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million, partly due to higher expected unabsorbed fixed costs. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $46 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million due to higher energy and chemical costs. Moving to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to be down $10 million, mostly due to export channels. Volume is expected to improve $30 million on initial demand recovery. Operations and costs are expected to improve earnings also by $30 million on improved fixed cost absorption. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $14 million and input costs should be stable. As noted in the segment details I just shared, maintenance outages across the company are expected to lower earnings by about $100 million in the third quarter. Details by business and quarter are included in the appendix. And lastly, under equity earnings, you will see our outlook for the Ilim joint venture. Turning to Slide 15, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation choices in the quarter. I'll start with the balance sheet. Debt repayment is a priority. During the second quarter, we reduced long-term debt by $200 million. We also called another $210 million of long-term debt as we expect to settle later this quarter, which will essentially eliminate all bond maturities through the end of 2021. I'd also note that we recently met with the rating agencies. And earlier this month, Moody's reaffirmed our investment-grade credit rating. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. Our Board of Directors authorized the third quarter dividend earlier this month. With the decision, we have returned about $600 million to shareholders through the third quarter. Looking at investments. We're increasing CapEx in 2020 by $200 million, bringing our full-year target to $800 million. This increase is mostly due to funding strategic projects with returns of more than 20% of our U.S. box business, as well as maintenance capital related to the incidents at Bogalusa and Rome earlier this year. As I said last quarter, we're taking a deliberate approach to capital funding decisions to ensure that we are well positioned for the eventual economic recovery. And while we're still early in the stages of 2021 capital planning, at this point you can expect next year's CapEx to be no higher than $800 million. Turning to Slide 16. We have strong liquidity in place with $3.6 billion of cash and standby liquidity at the end of the second quarter, as compared with $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. All of our facilities are committed and unused. We like the financial flexibility this provides given the severity of the economic crisis and the uncertainty of the pace of reopening and recovery. And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. I'm on Slide 12 now. Tim Nicholls : 17. Mark Sutton : 17, excuse me, 17. We began today's conversation talking about our strong first half performance. Our teams are doing a great job taking care of our customers and each other. We're executing well and staying focused on what we can control. You may have heard me say in the past that the company we built can thrive in just about any set of challenges and circumstances that we face. I think our first half performance reinforces my confidence that International Paper is a really strong company. We have great employees, the right channels to market to help our customers provide products that people depend on every day. The advantages we've established are serving us well in the near term, while we continue to strengthen the company for the long term. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark Sutton : Good morning, Debbie. Debbie Jones : Good morning. I was hoping we could just start by talking about demand in the corrugated business and kind of re-highlighting how trends have been through July? And then very specifically, how much commerce has become kind of a part of the business as a result of that and how that's kind of changed things for you? Mark Sutton : So I think I'll just take a shot at a couple of the most notable trends for us. The largest segment for corrugated packaging is processed food. As you know from past, the information we put out we are a bit overweight in that. And the demand trends have stabilized in that large segment and we're still seeing continued flow through the retail grocery channel and part of that has actually helped certain subsegments. One of the deal real positives that got into a little bit of trouble at the beginning was protein, mainly because of some production issues. A lot of that's being solved now. And we're seeing strong growth in our protein customers. And again, we've invested over the last several years in that particular segment to be able to perform even in periods where demand is picking up. On e-commerce, we still see I think I said last quarter order of magnitude above the normal growth double order of magnitude double-digit growth. We're still seeing that very, very solid -- it's a segment International Paper again has invested in and focused on. We're very good at it and our customers depend on us for a large portion of their fiber-based packaging needs and we're still continuing to see that. So largely, we're optimistic. There's still some uncertainty on the food service supply chain. I think we mentioned last quarter, produce -- a lot of produce does go to restaurants and cafeterias and some of that is starting to come back, but not in all cases. So we're still watching produce fresh food very closely. That's again an important segment for International Paper. But by and large, we think we'll see continued -- it's slow and steady, but continued improvement in the main segments for corrugated packaging as we go forward and we're seeing that in July. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I wanted to touch on paper demand as well. I realized that this past month the industry backed up was quite weak, but you are seeing a pickup or kind of predicting a volume improvement here sequentially in the order of $30 million. So I just wanted to better understand what's driving that? What you're seeing there? What do we need to look at going forward here to understand that trajectory as it relates to schools reopening people going back to work et cetera? Mark Sutton : I think Debbie you hit on an important one. The amount of people that feel comfortable returning to their normal workplace mainly offices and schools. And I think a lot of that depends on where we are with the pandemic, where we are with therapeutics and treatments. But we do see some pickup and it's partly because of those two areas. We'll have to watch it very, very closely to see that schools for example in places that have said they're going to open at least for options of in-person actually occur. Even if they don't, when school starts there'll be some improvement in demand as people now figured out how to do hybrid learning. Offices another question mark. People are bringing some of their employees back in a very careful way and we're seeing a correlation to Printing Paper demand with that. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark, good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wondered if we could get your -- just your thoughts globally on repurposing printing and writing paper assets into other markets, whether it's pulp or whether it's packaging. And maybe your thoughts for kind of the industry at large, but then in particular for IP for operations like [Indiscernible] over in Europe and also your big white paper businesses in Brazil and North America? Mark Sutton : So it's a good question Mark. It's a bit of a large question when you talk about the potential for repurposing. I mean technically, you can repurpose as you know depending on the configuration in the wood basket, it can be a really good idea and a smart use of capital or it can be a really bad idea and a lot of money. And so I'm not going to speak about all the possibilities in the world. But for IP where we are with our printing and writing business we've got world-class low-cost fiber in Brazil with that system i.e. eucalyptus fiber very well set up to serve the world for that type of product. The U.S. we've had an active process of slowly repositioning our southern locations that have softwood fiber availability either for fluff pulp or containerboard. That's worked well for us. And in Europe it's a specialty niche printing papers business if you will including what we do at -- it's mostly folding boxboard and things that aren't printing paper. So, for IP, we don't like the demand decline. We're not sure how much of it is going to be permitted if any. As Tim said, we expect the recovery to be drawn out, but we do like the way we're positioned to manage through this. And we have continued options for our particular assets in our particular customer base. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then the follow-on question I had is can you talk about sort of what the keys are going to be for improving performance in cellulose fibers? It seems to me it's been fairly disappointing since that Weyerhaeuser acquisition three and a half years ago. I know that a part of this is we've had quite weak years for just global pulp pricing. But beyond that what are the issues? Mark Sutton : Yes. It's -- we had a really good first 18 months to 24 months post-acquisition in combination of the business. If you remember the results in the latter half of 2018, we were approaching the margin structure we needed to be at cost of capital. Pricing has been a challenge flow through on both ends of our focus area which is absorbent products meaning some products that are on the higher end of that drifting into fluff pulp and absorbent needs because of problems in their end segment and then the disruption in connection to general softwood market pulp. For us, the formula for success is we need to be at about 85% absorbent in specialty. We're 10% off of that right now. We need to continue to put investments in place which we've paused to lower our cost structure, especially on the legacy system that IP had before we acquired Weyerhaeuser. And then we need to have the value propositions product, innovation, and commercial strategies to get a better overall pricing -- better overall margin from pricing and those are the things we're working on. There is a lot of noise and disruption in the global pulp ecosystem right now that's probably added a good year and a half to our progress plans. Fluff pulps still growing. The product is an important product the end uses. It's a product people buy into when they have a certain income level and we still believe in that growth level. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo. Gabe Hajde : Good morning Mark, Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning Gabe. Gabe Hajde : I was kind of focusing a little bit on the CapEx projects that you guys talked about I guess more on the strategic side $60 million. I know it's not necessarily large in the grand scheme of IP. But I'm curious if this is for specific kind of end markets within e-commerce even more particular thinking about online grocery delivery and something that's really been at least according to what I read accelerated given COVID. Tim Nicholls : Yes. Hey Gabe, it's Tim. It's some of that. It depends by geography across North America. So, what we're trying to do obviously e-commerce is growing at a rapid pace. Protein seems to be coming back and we believe in that segment long term. So, what we're doing is looking facility-by-facility and area-by-area of the United States for where we want to supplement and prepare for customer growth that we expect to achieve over the next increment of time. So, it's mostly strategic. It's around converting equipment. There's some corrugator upgrades. But it's preparing for supporting these very important segments that we have and customers that we have. Mark Sutton : Then just to add to Tim's comments. Some of what we're doing because of the growth in some of the segments e-commerce is a great example. It puts pressure on existing plants. So, some of this investment is really targeted at debottlenecking the bottlenecks that have been created because of the good growth we've seen. And that's all solvable with just a little bit of reconfiguration. And in some cases investment to add a particular type of capability or process line at a plant that doesn't have it today. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then I guess bigger picture question appreciating it's probably difficult to answer. But you mentioned kind of a drawn out recovery in printing paper at the same time again kind of what we seeing here in the outside world you see announcements from Google delaying or embracing I guess work from home until mid-2021. It seems like some other organizations are looking to do the same such that there would be some sort of structural decline in printing paper similar to what we saw in the 2008-2009 crisis. Can you speak to any of that? And kind of how you're thinking about your system and how you might respond? Mark Sutton : So, we are thinking about it. We have a pretty robust demand model. It's hard to figure out what inputs to put in it right now because of the sheer speed at which this pandemic has changed everybody's work life. But all those factors around how fast people return and what they do after their return will factor into it. Again, as I mentioned, in answering Mark's question. I think our system is of the size and of a capability and of a physical location that it gives us some options. We just took out a big part of our system, to make the white top containerboard, at Riverdale. We didn't know this was coming at the same time, but it actually has helped soften the blow for us is paper now becomes in the mid-teens, as a percentage of IP's total company. But look, it's hard to tell on a permanent basis. But if we just use what we learned in the past and what you mentioned about the Great Recession, it's likely there's some type of step down. And then, a new level starts back with the secular decline. But it's just very difficult to predict that -- what that will be if it will actually happen. And -- but we do share the view that you just expressed. That's been what's happened in the past. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Thanks what you are doing with COVID as well. Mark Sutton : Thanks. George Staphos : I want go to a question on industrial. And we've chatted about it I guess in the past, but we're now a quarter or two since COVID began. The company has done a very good job, frankly as other containerboard companies have done in making what would normally have been fixed costs, somewhat variable and leveraging the system. And as a result, blunting the impact of weaker demand and pricing even since last year is there a natural limit coming at some point where your ability to flex the system either because of what's happening with your mix, what's happening with demand, I'm not sure that where you wouldn't be able to get the same level of buffer that you've seen, in the business? Or do you think you have kind of a blue sky here, you can continue managing the variable cost or the fixed cost to be variable, for the foreseeable future? Mark Sutton : So that's a hard question to answer in the way that you asked it. What we do conceptually as we look at all of our costs as potentially variable, all of our material costs all of our operating costs. What we don't look at as variable is, our people because our people are highly skilled and they make this happen. And we're fortunate that that's not the largest percentage of cost in the materials industry as you know. The inputs are the largest. And so we've designed supply chain and flexibility, and all the investments, we've done since the beginning of the 2000s to make our facilities be able to make the same products to be able to run profitably without running wide all of that comes into this. So think about what we did last year with the high levels of lack of order downtime in containerboard and we variabilize costs. This year we're doing that without high levels. We actually have pretty strong demand in the first half of the year. So I think there's a limit to everything, but there is not, there's not a view by IP that we have to only be successful when we have absolute wide open absolute perfect economy. We've got a lot of levers. And again, I give our employees a lot of credit. They've come up with some different ways to variabilize some of what looks like fixed cost in a normal materials business. And I see our ability to do that is continuing. George Staphos : Mark Thanks. That's helpful. So within reason obviously in terms of whatever the demand picture might look like or pricing for that matter you have the ability to manage the system it sounds like. I wanted to come back to a question that Mark had teed up on pulp. Again looking back over time, 2016 was a very tough period for pulp. It was a year where the company didn't do as well. 2017 and 2018 were strong years for the business, but that was also a strong period for the global pulp cycle, irrespective of fluff versus commodity markets. And once again now, we're kind of at a low point, hopefully at a bottom when you look at pulp pricing and the company's had. Its earnings challenges. You mentioned that the formal success will be getting the mix to about 85% absorbent investments and further cost reductions, and furthering your value proposition to your customers so as to get better pricing and commercial benefits. If you added all that up together, what do you think would be the increment to your earnings power from current levels? What could that add to your business? And would you be mid-cycle if you did that at a mid-cycle level in terms of the market burning above cost of capital? Thank you, guys. Mark Sutton : Thanks. And I think that level of success the structure we've talked about is we need margins in that 20% range or high teens, we need a lower cost structure. And then, what I meant by commercial and value proposition is, like any business if you look at our profitability by product, segment and customer, it's obviously not a straight line across. We have some really high-value specialty products inside of fluff that we just need to grow and develop more of. And that was the vision when we put IP and Weyerhaeuser together. It was taken off track a little bit by the global pulp environment, a little bit by our own doing a couple of years ago. But I believe, we can get back to that level of track. I'm not going to give you an earnings projection, but we did give one back a few quarters ago, eight quarters ago that, at this number the company \u2013 or this business would be at cost of capital. That's probably still a number that's in the right range. George Staphos : All right. Thank you, Mark. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Regarding the investments that you're making in the North American converting system, did those move the needle in terms of your forward integration rate which I think is 85%, if I have that right? And is raising the integration rate is it important to IP? Or is it not necessarily something that's sort of a goal in and of itself? Tim Nicholls : Hey, Anthony, it's Tim. It's \u2013 so the goal that we have is the more that we can put through our North American integrated channel the better we like it. We know that our margins that's our most profitable channel to market. So, we're always looking for innovative and creative ways to do that. This is simply funding capability and capacity where we have had long-term strategy around certain segments. We've built up our capabilities to supply customers' needs in those segments, and we're trying to keep pace with the growth that we expect from those customers in those segments. So, we don't have a hard fixed target on integration per se, but we are constantly looking to intelligently put more volume through our North American channel because that's where we make the most money. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then in pulp you talked a little bit about stockpiling turning to destocking over the course of the quarter. And I'm wondering, on the Industrial Packaging side, when you look at customer inventories or maybe even consumer inventories of finished products, is there any stockpiling that could turn into kind of a destocking headwind? Or do you feel like inventories are sort of pretty normal out there? Tim Nicholls : No. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we think it for containerboard \u2013 in the U.S. for containerboard we were \u2013 we're squeezed. We're tied based on the recovery that we saw. So, if anything the issue there is making sure that we've got the right grades and basis weights in the right places across our system. On the export side, we think customer inventories for roll stock are in very normal ranges for the time of year and the season. And so we're in between seasons right now. We think inventory levels are in good shape. And with the season \u2013 the agricultural season picks back up around the world in late August, September, October, we think inventory should be in good shape. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on one or two questions that were already asked. Just e-commerce obviously is a growing part of the company it has been for a while. I think in the past you talked about it might be 10% of your mix or box shipments. Just wondering, if you could kind of \u2013 do you guys have an estimate of where that figure might stand now given that we've seen quite a bit of growth there and some declines in other parts of the company? And, do you see any potential challenges to that continuing to be a bigger part of the mix going forward? Tim Nicholls : No, challenges. I mean, we like our position, and we think we've got a great customer set across e-commerce that have different needs and we cater to them with different capabilities and different service platforms. In past times, when things were more normal it was growing and it was probably just under 10%. I would say today, with the dynamic that you mentioned it's probably one point or two above 10%, and growing rapidly. So yeah, I mean, it's not a dramatic move in a normalized type of setting, but we have seen it become a bigger part of the mix. But we like the segment, and we like the customers that we have and expect to continue growing at a high rate with all of those customers. Brian Maguire : Okay. And then just one on the sort of the equity investments maybe kind of a multi-part question. But just to clarify will the sheet feeder now be consolidated on the financials? And then, do you see more equity investment potential partnerships in the U.S. to sort of tie up with some of the independents that remain out there? And then just sort of finally related to that any thoughts on your partnership with Graphic Packaging and the potential to monetize that in the near term? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I'll start with Graphic and work backwards if I can. On Graphic, we said earlier this year that we like the partnership. We think they run a great business. We decided it wasn't strategic to International Paper. And so we started with the first tranche of selling our position and we have said repeatedly that that clearly puts us on a monetization path. So, we're now in the window again. We continue to try to be thoughtful about that and make sure that, we're not traders and we're not here to hold it indefinitely. We just want to make sure that we're maximizing value within a range. So, clearly on a monetization path over the next few quarters. And I think you understand that there are specific requirements for our agreement in terms of how that monetization takes place. And so it's basically a max of $250 million every six months, and since we did in January we're now back in the next window available to us. In terms of the -- what was the other part of your question? I'm sorry. The\u2026 Brian Maguire : Sorry. Yes. There were a couple in there. So just one to clarify on the sheet feeder investment will you start to consolidate those earnings now? And then just any other equity investment potentials? Tim Nicholls : Yes. No, it won't be consolidated, because we have a minority position, but we're excited about the opportunity and the relationship that we'll have with the other equity holders. And we're creative and we look for opportunities to do things from a service and capability level that others maybe can or won't do. And so I'm not going to speak specifics, but we want to be thoughtful and creative about how we participate in all of the segments of the North American market. Brian Maguire : Okay. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, yes, my first question was also on the Graphic stake and how you'll be thoughtful. So when you're considering whether to sell, is it not only your own cash needs, but also the implications for Graphic's financial ratios and therefore the iterative process on valuation? Tim Nicholls : Well, we make decisions based on International Paper's investors and stakeholders. And so I think from our cash position and liquidity position that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we feel really good about cash flow and cash available to us through the committed facilities that we have. So it's really down to capital allocation and looking at different choices that we have before we can apply cash and then trying to be thoughtful about making the right decisions across our entire capital allocation framework. Steve Chercover : Okay. Thanks. And then my second question, I'm going to say the word that you would never really heard, which is Asbestos. I think it's is the first time that I recall you taking a reserve. Can you give us a little more color? I mean, this isn't the first hopefully phase of a bigger situation. I'm sure you've got Asbestos being 100-year-old company? Tim Nicholls : Yes. No, it's mostly related to acquisition around Champion Products. And we think we're -- we've dealt with it. It's just a matter of being conservative and we took the approach that we're going to be extremely conservative in establishing this reserve. And so we took the charge in the second quarter. That reflects a very long like a 40-year period of time that we think there could be excluded. Steve Chercover : Okay. And my final is more of a comment than a question. I really love winning streak, so I hope you've got financial ability to keep your dividend street alive. Good luck. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. Hope you and your families are well. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Adam. Adam Josephson : Two demand questions. Tim, I think Debbie asked about July, I don't think if you gave it. Would you mind giving us a number for what you were up in July? And if whatever that number is for July is roughly your expectation for the balance of the quarter? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean it's very similar to what we experienced in June. And as you can imagine June was a strong month relative to where we were earlier in the second quarter. So I don't have a number off the top of my head, but July is like a carbon copy of June's results. So we feel very good about how the quarter is starting. The color that we provided in prepared remarks segments that have performed well are continuing to perform well, and we're seeing normalization across other segments as economies reopen, so. Adam Josephson : Got it got it. Thanks. And Mark you talked earlier about corrugated packaging outpacing the economic backdrop in the U.S., but not so in Europe it sounded like. If I heard you right, what do you attribute the differences between the two regions to particularly given that Europe has handled COVID, obviously, much more effectively than we have judging by the difference in case numbers? Mark Sutton : Yes. I think the outpacing comment is given the GDP and all the other traditional indicators, our particular product is performing a lot better in a difficult economic backdrop mainly because of what the product does. I think the comparison in Europe and the U.S. is probably because of Europe's approach on the pandemic and how they've gone about managing the economy country-by-country. And you compare that to the U.S. where we've done some things maybe a little quicker. It may or may not play out to be the correct thing to do for all indicators, but I think our economy is opening a little bit faster and I think the supply chain in the U.S. is a little bit more robust than what we see in the European market. Adam Josephson :   Tim, if I may just ask one more on ops and cost. I think there were about $150 million more favorable in the quarter than you were expecting. A lot of that was in Industrial. Can you just talk about a little more specifically what in the ops and cost bucket was much better than you were expecting? I assume demand was a little better so you had better -- less unabsorbed overhead. But can you just go into a little more detail of what was so much more favorable related to ops and costs? Thank you. Tim Nicholls : Yes. Sure. It's a lot of things and it's across the board. All of our business is performing well. So reliability has been very good given this environment. We haven't had the major operational disruptions that you can have sometimes. Mills are very large complex operations with a lot of moving parts. But our reliability has been good. The way we've managed the system where economic downtime has been taken, we've managed it very well going back to the comments mark made about variabilizing cost. Supply chain has performed well. And maintenance outages, while they were fewer the ones that we've had we've executed very well against them. So it's really across the board that we've seen good performance. Adam Josephson : Thanks Tim. Best of luck. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. On Page 25 you lay out the downtime in the different businesses. I'm just curious how would Bogalusa and Rome where production wasn't in the second quarter, I assume there was some outage related to what's happening there how would that get treated? And I asked the question in the context of as you now have Riverdale ramping up I'm trying to understand sort of where the starting point is and what type of demand growth you would need to be seeing to have that additional production capability absorbed in your system presumably the sheet feeder would be -- well not specific for Riverdale of course for your entire system would be one way that you'd be absorbing more? But maybe if you just talk us through a little bit on how to think about all of this? Tim Nicholls : Yes. So in Riverdale it's a very unique product. So we're making a high-quality, white top linerboard sheet and we have a customer base with products that consume white top. And so, we'll manage it the same way we manage the rest of the system in terms of the customer demand that we have for those products. It also allows for other facilities and this was part of the investment rationale to focus on grades that they make. So whether it's facing paper or board for gypsum or recycled liners we have now incremental capacity where it's been freed up in certain facilities and move to Riverdale that gets flexed the same way all of our other capacity gets flexed. If we don't need to produce it because there's not a customer demand, we don't produce it. In terms of Rome and Bogalusa those were really maintenance events. Those were unplanned downtime due to specific events. So it's a little bit in an environment like this, it's still a little bit squishy, but we try to capture that as part of the earnings. Mark Sutton : Mark, I think the main point on Riverdale is what Tim was talking about, and that is, it's not the same product that we make in the other mills. And to the earlier questions around variabilizing cost, we're going to make the unbleached medium weight, light weight and heavy weight leer that we need for the order book. But this Riverdale product is going to be an upgrade for existing light top that we make at other facilities that's not near as high-quality and it's going to be a strong value proposition for winning new business. So we'll adjust our system. We're not going to make room for Riverdale. We're actually going to market the Riverdale product as an upgrade to what we do today. And as a value proposition for e-business, and we'll adjust the non-high-performance white top part of our system as needed. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And so is it fair to think about -- when we think about the earnings base here for the North American Industrial business, can we essentially look at Riverdale and assume some $100 million or whatever is the appropriate number of incremental EBITDA as part of that earnings base and it's not cannibalizing from any other part of the business? Tim Nicholls : Yes. There will be an increment of additional earnings out of Riverdale in a normalized environment, of course. And that was the basis for the investment and the related benefits that we got in the other facilities. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Mark Connelly of Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Your Madrid project solved a problem that had developed with your nonintegrated box plants. And I understand they're really not nonintegrated because of all the stuff comes from the U.S. Has your European converting acquisition strategy changed because of the experience you had in Spain, or was that really just a one-off in your mind? Mark Sutton : Hi, Mark. I think, I would say it changed a little bit. We saw the value of this regional integration better and more clear when we had the Madrid mill. So the plants we acquired, or in one case even swapped, one that was in Northern France for one that was in Spain, it's a very good business model for us. Given the fact that the European market is kind of regionally segmented, we think a good dense, high-quality mill and box plant network is the best model for an IP in that market versus more homogeneous market in-country like we have in the U.S. So I think we learned something there, and it has kept us more in whatever you want to call it, more in the kind of bolt on, very focused growth mode versus other avenues we could take. Mark Connelly : Okay. That's super helpful. And just a simple one, I assume that the $800 million of CapEx for next year doesn't contemplate any of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of future potential conversion. So if you did decide to do something like that, that would be outside the $800 million? Tim Nicholls : That's right. Yes. That's right, Mark. Mark Connelly : Super. Very helpful. Thank you. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Mark Sutton : Tim Nicholls : So as we wrap up, I just want to once again thank the International Paper employees for their extraordinary commitment through this pandemic. We've got to obviously manage the ongoing uncertainty as our communities where we live and work, reopen. But as I said last quarter, and I'll say it again, with even more conviction. I'm very, very confident in our future. We have a strong financial footing, and all of our stakeholders can count on us to do the right things. We're going to be guided by our core values of safety, ethics and stewardship, and we're going to deliver for the stakeholders that are depending on us. So thanks for your time this morning and for your interest in International Paper. Operator : Thank you for participating in the International Paper second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President Investor Relations. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2020 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide 3. International Paper delivered solid results and robust cash flows in a dynamic environment. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow through the first three quarters as we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our company. We're on track to generate $2 billion in free cash flow this year, through our early actions and strong execution. Relative to demand, recovery trends continue to vary by business and by end user consumer segments. Demand for our corrugated packaging accelerated the third quarter and that momentum continues in the fourth quarter. In fluff pulp as expected, we experienced seasonally lower demand and destocking across most regions. In papers, we're in an early stage of recovery as offices and school activities began to restart. Against this backdrop, our commercial supply chain and manufacturing organizations are executing at a high level to ensure we meet our customer's changing needs, leveraging the scale and flexibility of our system and optimizing our cost. The company's solid performance in the third quarter reinforces our financial strength and commitment to our capital allocation framework. Turning now to slide four which shows our third quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share, which included an unfavorable Ilim foreign exchange non-cash impact of $0.14 in the quarter. Sales improved sequentially and came in benign expectations, driven by strong demand in our North American packaging business. EBITDA increased by nearly $100 million sequentially, even as planned maintenance outage expenses stepped out by about $80 million. As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow in the third quarter, which continue to apply in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework. During the third quarter, we reduced debt by about $800 million bringing year-to-date debt reduction to $1.1 billion. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved the fourth quarter dividend bringing the full year optimizations for our dividend to $800 million. Moving to slide five, as I reflect on our performance this year, it reaffirms my admiration and appreciation for our 50,000 employees worldwide, who continue to perform in a high level by taking care of each other and our customers. I'm especially grateful to our front-line teams in manufacturing and converting facilities around the world. We remained absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles and we'll continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short term and in the long term. Now, I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark, good morning. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings page on slide six. Third quarter operating earnings were better than we expected, driven by strong commercial and operating performance, as well as outstanding cost management. Higher volume contributed to improved fixed cost absorption in the quarter, which is captured in operations and cost. Third quarter performance also demonstrated some one-time items, which favorably impacted operations and cost. Looking at the bridge, price and mix was essentially flat. Volume was favorable driven by strong demand for corrugated packaging in North America, and improved demand for printing papers across all regions. Operations and cost benefited from improved fixed cost absorption on higher volume. The businesses continue to maximize job managing cost and delivered strong operational performance to mitigate the impact for gains in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, one-time items contributed favorably to operations and cost, adding at up $30 million or $0.06 per share with each business seeing about $10 billion in benefits. As expected, maintenance outage costs were a drag in the third quarter which is our highest plant maintenance outage quarter this year. I'll remind you that in response to COVID-19, we made significant adjustments to the scope and timing of our maintenance outage plant. We now expect the full year maintenance outage expense to be $450 million compared to $585 million in the original forecast that we shared with you at the beginning of the year. Input costs were favorable, mostly due to lower recovered fiber costs. We did experience higher energy and distribution cost as we exited the third quarter, which we see as a positive sign of an improving economy. Operating expenses were lower than expected, benefiting from about $20 million in foreign currency adjustment. Tax expense was lower by $0.07 per share in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate of 19% compared to 26% in the second quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to our federal tax provision after finalizing our 2019 tax return. Equity earnings include the noncash foreign exchange loss of $0.14 in the third quarter for Ilim as compared to a $0.09 gain in the second quarter. Turning to the segments and starting with industrial packaging on Slide 7, the business performed well, driven by strong commercial and operational performance. Across the segment, price and mix was stable. Volume improved sequentially across all regions with strong demand in North America, where demand accelerated in the third quarter in just about every segment. We're seeing the benefits of strong at-home consumption. And we're in the early stages of recovery in food service. We continue to see very strong double-digit growth in e-commerce with increased consumer reliance on e-commerce as a buying channel. More recently, we're seeing better performance for industrial and durable goods across a broad spectrum of the end use segments. Especially those linked with construction and home improvement. Our export containerboard shipments were lower in the third quarter, due to the strong demand in North America and the impact of weather events. With that said, underlying demand and our export channels picked up as we entered the seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Our mills and converting facilities performed well. We managed direct and indirect cost well, while fixed costs absorption improved on higher volume, all of which helped mitigate the impact of precautionary downtime related to the hurricanes. Maintenance outage costs were lower than expected, as we de-sculpt and shifted some outage activity to the fourth quarter to better support customer demand in the third quarter. Input costs were favorable driven by lower recovered fiber costs, we did see higher energy and distribution costs as we exited the third quarter, along with a sharp increase in natural gas costs from the COVID related lows as economies reopened. Lastly, an update on Riverdale 15, the white-top wider board conversion, the ramp up is progressing, ahead of schedule and qualification activities are advancing rapidly through our box system. As a reminder, this investment benefits our box customers, who value high impact graphics and strengthens our containerboard offerings. Moving to Slide 8, we've often talked about how we're investing to enhance our capabilities. And while that is often associated with investments we make in our mills and box systems, another important investment we're making is around innovation and enhancing customer specific solutions. It comes back to the fundamental notion that boxes are tailored to meet each of our customer's unique needs. We're accelerating innovation to further our advantages and faster growing box segments. We developed [ph] e-box, a software platform that enables our teams of experts to work with our e-commerce customers to determine the optimal design and suite of boxes to minimize packaging waste and reduce their freight costs. For our protein customers, we developed a recyclable moisture barrier that allows poultry, beef and pork boxes to compete - to complete the fiber cycle. For our fresh produce customers, we provide a full-service machinery platform that's tailored to meet each customer's packaging needs. These are just a few examples of how we provide value to our customers to ensure they have the right box with the right support services for each particular application. If we look at Slide 9 a quick update on the demand outlook for containerboard export. Demand improved as we move through the third quarter and customer inventories are currently normal to the low side. We're seeing an expected seasonal pickup in the Mediterranean region with an especially robust citrus season in Northern Africa and a solid start in Spain. We're also seeing a nice pickup in demand in China for industrial production recovers. And in Latin America favorable weather conditions are supported to continued solid demand for banana and pineapple boxes. Our export containerboard channels provide good insight to box demand expectations across key regions given a typical 60-day lead time. If we turn to global cellulose fibers on Slide 10, price and mix was favorable on price flow through. Volume is stable with a mix of about 75% fluff and specialty pulp. Operations and costs were impacted by unabsorbed fixed costs, which was partially offset by about $10 million a favorable one-time items, including higher seasonal productivity sales. Maintenance outage costs increased as planned, and input cost increased on higher wood and energy costs. Taking a closer look at fluff pulp demand in the quarter, we experienced seasonally weaker demand and destocking across most regions. This follows a rather strong pull forward in demand during the first half of the year. Overall, demand is stable going into the fourth quarter with improved fluff demand offset by weak demand for printing and writing grades, tissue demand remains healthy. If we turn to Slide 11, and look at Printing Papers, demand improved in just about every region from COVID restriction lows in the second quarter, but remained well below than prior year levels. Across this segment, price and mix decreased primarily due to lower export pricing in Latin America, and lower pricing in Europe. Volume improved across all regions with year-over-year demand improving from about minus 30% in the second quarter to about minus 15% in the third quarter in our key regions. Operations and costs benefited from improved fixed cost absorption and economic downtime decreased by 225,000 tonnes sequentially across all regions. We also benefited from about $10 million of one-time items primarily related to COVID subsidies and green energy credits in Europe. The business continues to generate meaningful cash flows by focusing on cost management and working capital. We exited the quarter with our inventories at our target range based on the current demand environment. As we think about recovery, we saw a meaningful improvement in demand in the third quarter. We know uncertainty remains while COVID restrictions persists, however, we do expect the recovery to accelerate as economies fully reopen. Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12. We had an equity loss of $33 million in the quarter. This includes a non-cash foreign exchange loss on Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt of which IP's after-tax portion was $55 million or $0.14 a share. Volume improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by higher softwood pulp exports to China. However, pricing mix decreased on lower pulp pricing. Operations for solid and maintenance outages were well executed. The third quarter was Ilim's highest maintenance outage quarter in 2020. Turning to Slide 13 we'll cover the outlook. We continue to operate in a dynamic environment with demand trends varying by business and end use customer segments. As mentioned, demand for corrugated packaging accelerated in the third quarter, and that momentum continues in the fourth quarter. Demand for fluff pulp is normalizing following the inventory destocking which occurred in the third quarter. In printing papers, we're seeing a modest recovery although demand challenges persist. Taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging, we expect price index to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million, with strongbox demand mostly offsetting the impact of three less shipping days in the fourth quarter. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $50 million, including the non-repeat of one-time benefits in the third quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $45 million and input costs are expected to increase by $20 million, mostly due to higher energy and transportation costs. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease by $5 million. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $20 million, which again includes the non-repeat of favorable items in the third quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $4 million and input costs are expected to be stable. Turning to Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to improve $20 million on higher seasonal demand in Latin American. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $25 million, mostly due to the non-repeat of one-time benefits in the third quarter and higher seasonal energy cost. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $16 million and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million. Lastly, under equity earnings, you'll see our outlook for the Ilim joint venture. Turning to slide 14, as Mark said in his opening remarks, we're on track to generate $2 billion in free cash flow in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility and some of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation and what has been undoubtedly one of the most uncertain environments we faced. Given the economic uncertainty at the time, we chose to pull some of these levers including capital spending. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked in 2020 and choices were made or rather planned maintenance outages and other spending priorities, which we expect will contribute about 15% of our free cash flow this year. Our early actions and strong execution across the company are enabling us to deliver another year of strong free cash flow generation, reflecting the resilience of International Paper. Turning to slide 15, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation choices in the third quarter. Debt repayment is a priority. During the third quarter, we reduced debt by nearly $800 million, which brings debt reduction to $1.1 billion through the third quarter. We've essentially eliminated all bond maturities through the end of 2021 and improved our maturity profile over the next decade. I'd also note that we've reduced annual interest expense by nearly $60 million on debt reduction activity through the third quarter. You can expect additional debt reduction in the fourth quarter, with an expected debt-to-EBITDA of around three times at year end on a Moody's basis. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. Our Board of Directors authorized the fourth quarter dividend earlier this month. With this decision, we will have returned about $800 million to shareholders through the fourth quarter. Looking at investments, we're on track with our $800 million capital spending target in 2020, which includes the Riverdale conversion, as well as other funding priorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in our U.S. box business. With regard to our investment in Graphic Packaging, we received $250 million in cash in the third quarter related to the second transaction. This is the maximum amount permitted for each period under the agreement. Our ownership position is now approximately 14.8%. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim for all the detail. Look, this is our third earnings call under the realities of COVID-19. And as I said from the outset, International Paper answered this crisis in a position of strength, it really starts with the talent and commitment of our employees, that strong position is reinforced by our capabilities to provide the best solutions for our customers and by our customers themselves. We are partnered with many of the winning customers in multiple segments across our three businesses. And our strong positions supported by our world class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. All of which contributed once again to our solid performance and strong cash generation in quarter. I'm pleased with our performance and really excited about our strong outlook for the fourth quarter, and the momentum we're generating especially in our packaging business. And with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo securities. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, everyone. Hope, you and your families are doing well. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Gabe. Gabe Hajde : First question Mark, it has to do with the Global Cellulose Fibers business. And from my perspective, quite frankly, I don't think you guys are getting much credit for it. So, I recognize that where you guys play this is somewhat of a sub segment of the larger complex. So, I'm curious if there's something unique about kind of this cycle, outside of the obvious COVID impact that we're seeing in printing tissue in total, that is negatively impacting kind of the supply demand dynamics globally? And then relatedly, I think you guys made a management change here. And given Mr. Hammock's background would seemingly imply more of a fixes might be commercial. But I'm curious if there's anything on the operational side that might be contemplated, we didn't see much in the way of footprint consolidation, post warehousing? Mark Sutton : Those are three really good questions about our Global Cellulose fibers business, first one on the cycle, I think that there's nothing unique about this particular cycle. If you think about '18, it was at the peak of pricing, the peak of demand, '19 was a somewhat normal reset. And then as we were turning the corner in the beginning of '20, prices were moving-up, volume was moving-up, COVID hit, temporarily that was a benefit. But now with the demand decline in printing papers, a certain amount of softwood pulp has stranded. So, there's a supply issue that's unique to this cycle, but it's really COVID related. And it's related to the demand decline in printing papers, some of that softwood pulp is finding its way into absorbing products at the margins. And that's creating what I believe, as a temporary structural issue. On operations, I've talked before about what the business needs to be successful post the combination of IP and warehouser, and that is, moving the mix to about 85% absorbent products, so fluff and specialties, minimal position, but a small position in market pulp, to balance the system. And then, having the cost structure of the best mills, which tended to be some of the ones we acquired, be the cost structure of most of the mills, and some of that is going to take some investment. We've developed some of the projects and now it's a matter of timing in those investments so, improving the mix, improving the cost structure - the manufacturing cost structure, and then operating commercially in an excellent way through the normal cyclicality. As far as the management change, you mentioned, Tim Hammock, his background suits what the business needs right now very well. He's had tremendous success commercially in different businesses in the company. And after we did the integration, and we put the teams together, which was done very well, he does have the right skill set for where we're going forward. So, we're excited about the role he'll play in that business. And we believe in the business long term, we made this investment. If I take you back to the end of 2016, in order to position IP in another fiber advantaged, growth-oriented market, albeit small market, it was a play for the longer term. And I think as you think about the demand drivers for diapers, adult incontinence and the other absorbent products, it's got good fundamental demand dynamics around the world. We have to level, set and improve our supply position, mainly in the ways that I've been described. Gabe Hajde : Thank you very much, Mark. I'll try to be brief here with the follow up as it relates to the Industrial Packaging segment. Obviously, demand has been somewhat episodic with the COVID impact. But I'm curious kind of, if you can share anything, what you're hearing from your customers in terms of inventory levels. We're hearing that things are pretty well depleted. And really, we're just seeing the benefits itself right now, but just curious if you have any insight there? Mark Sutton : And it is by segment really Gabe, a story by segment and we are seeing some very positive trends in areas that we're heard a little bit. And part of it is I think inventory depletion. So, the center - processed foods center of the grocery store has picked up very nicely. We talked a lot about e-commerce, that's up a lot, and it's staying up a lot. We began to see some improvement as restaurants open, we have to see what that looks like as we head into the fall and winter, predictable caseload of COVID moving up and what different governments do to deal with that, but really encouraging news across the board sequentially. But even on a year-over-year basis, the e-commerce channel has an order of magnitude different than that it has been, we think some of that will stay. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Good morning. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : You highlighted some of the investments for customer tailored solutions for e-commerce and protein, I'm just wondering from a big picture perspective, if you can talk about the kind of returns you get from those investments? And then for the products themselves if there's a margin differential or just how you get paid for those solutions when you're on the ground with the customer? Mark Sutton : So the examples that Tim shared, are just a few examples of addressing the needs of our box customers. And then that flows back through our value chain all the way to the type of substrates and containerboard that we would make to make those boxes. And if it's a capital investment, we're always looking at north of 20% returns, but some of them not capital investments, they're design investments. And that's what we tried to highlight in this particular earnings call that the talent level of our go-to-market strategy and our designers is coming up with unique products and unique services that can run on our equipment that we have. So, the capital investment is small. Where we see the payoff is two ways. Usually there's a margin benefit, if in fact it's a total cost of ownership, meaning it lowers the customer's cost. And two, it positions us in a differentiated way in a very competitive market to where we grow our position with a certain customer, because we have an offering that's just enough different from the competitive set that it helps us to grow our position. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just sticking with Industrial Packaging, the containerboard price hike that's been announced I'm just wondering to the extent that you can. If you could talk about sort of the typical timing of price increases on boxes, how much maybe using history as a guide might show up in 4Q versus 1Q versus 2Q next year? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Hey, Anthony, it's Tim. So, we see the following a normal path. For us, we might pick up a little bit in the fourth quarter, but it's very minimal. Every contract is different, but most of our contracts allow for a one quarter lag. And so, we start seeing the real benefits in the first quarter and then continuing on in the second, next year. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Your packaging, obviously, demand really seems to be picking up a lot. If we could get your quarter-to-date box shipments, that would be helpful. And maybe even more importantly, what do you think is going on assuming that you have seen some of there's really strong pickup lately that we're hearing from others as well? And now how sustainable is it? And do you think folks are rebuilding inventories that got very low? And so to a certain extent, our - what we saw before was understated? Or is it more potentially virus getting ahead of the price increase? Any color you could give would be helpful? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, hey, Mark its Tim. I don't think it's getting ahead of the price increase; people just don't warehouse boxes. They take up too much space. I think that some of what Mark said earlier, there is some replenishing of supply chains that's going on. But there's also the continued opening of economies as well. And so, we've seen pickups in the third quarter, August was better than July, September was better than August, is continuing in October. Right now nearing the end of the month, where we're looking at about a 6% increase on a daily basis in our box system. But it's really strong e-commerce that continues to grow and I think that some of these other segments starting to come back. One thing that we see a little bit of a shift just on durable goods, it looks like people are substituting travel for durable goods purchases or maybe making other trade-offs like that. So we've seen an acceleration as we come in from the third into the fourth. If you look at the market overall on a daily basis, the market stopped a little bit over a point year-to-date. So, in an upset condition, pretty good growth and I think it look like Mark said, it'll vary by segment as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And just you made that comment that export market is looking strong and general demand picking up. And one area China, you mentioned industrial getting a bit better. But I guess one of the big questions is, how is China going to be dealing with their fiber issues with no OCC going in potentially next year? And as you look at it, could China become increasingly important buyer of Kraftliner from North America? And how important a factor could this be in the global equation? Tim Nicholls : Well, so we - our base case is we take them at their word. And we think all imports and OCC will end then like they say it will. It'll be a fiber balance equation as you suggest. I think some of it will get satisfied by market pulp for certain end uses. And yes, I think there could be a step up in not only Kraftliner purchases, but probably recycled pulp purchases as well. That may take a little bit of time to fully play out. And as to where it comes from, I think it's going to come from a lot of different places. Mark Sutton : And I would just add Mark that, the highest quality of covered fiber in the world comes from the U.S. market because of the high concentration Kraftliner boxes. And while China may not take any as OCC, it will probably take some of that feedstock as a version of recycled pulp or processed one-time before it goes into China. And in the region, there are some people doing that. And I think there'll be some people doing that from the U.S. with high quality recover fiber, minimal cost input to clean it up, roll it and then I think it probably qualifies as input fiber to China. But we'll see how that plays out. No one knows exactly how, but the simple math says that there's a tremendous fiber need for the growing Chinese economy that'll have to come from somewhere. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar of Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : On the Riverdale project, you mentioned the startup being ahead of schedule. I was wondering, if you can just talk about your plan to rent in volume for deployment stronger near-term demand backdrop? And are you seeing any significant differences in the supply and demand dynamics of white-top versus tradition linerboard? Mark Sutton : I think on Riverdale, we were really pleased with the ramp up once we started up. So the ramp up of the startup is ahead of schedule. The project itself obviously was impacted in the final stages by trying to finish a large construction project during a pandemic. But it's running well, the quality is really, really good, in some cases exceeding our design expectations. And we will adjust that product as we said before, that white-top liner into our system in place of some lower quality white-top we were making, and then we'll just balance the brown and white. But we don't see any significant demand shifts right now in the need for white-top other than the growth drivers we saw when we approved the project. So we're excited about it. It's going to help our box customers. It's going to help some of our open market customers, who make their own boxes. Some of this product goes into the premium segments, premium wines, premium beverages and there's a pretty strong demand for some of that. And probably some of its related to the way people are confined to home. Neel Kumar : Thanks. That's helpful. And there's also an article recently about Amazon, again, looking to reduce the amount of packing and uses and some shifting towards padded mailers rather than boxes. E-commerce demand has actually been very strong this year. But I was curious to see any evidence and mailers taking share from boxes? I mean in general, how are you thinking about the efficiency of packaging in the e-commerce channel overtime and the impact of any type of initiatives? Mark Sutton : So, we try to look at the solution that the customer needs, whether it's a box or a mailer, we try to obviously steer customers towards a sustainable choice which is fiber based. And we see growth in both. Mailers are used for certain type of items, where it's the better solution. Maybe some of those items were in boxes before mailers became more effective. But we see growth - in the box segment we see growth. In the mailer segment, we participated a bit on the craft paper side of that. And when Tim talked about this e-box technology, we are proactively helping all of our e-commerce customers optimize their packaging suite. So the right size box, if it's a box, and in many cases the box is definitely the right solution given the supply chain it's got to travel through. But if it's a piece of clothing, maybe a mailer works fine. But we are actively working proactively to get the waist down, to make the packaging experience for our customers cost effective and for the consumer to know that they are doing something that's sustainable. If they recycle that box to 92% of more recycled, that that goes back on the screen and it's just a good overall solution to commerce. And so, we're actively involved in that Neel and view it as a positive not a negative. Neel Kumar : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim good morning. Mark Sutton : Hi Adam. Adam Josephson : Mark, just one question on the free sheet business, you took a good bit of downtime in your North American papers business this quarter, as you did last quarter. If you assume that current demand levels stay roughly where they are, how much oversupply would you say you have? And after having just converted Riverdale, are you more inclined to potentially convert another paper machine to containerboard? Or to shot a machine if you eventually decide that you need to take more capacity actions in that business? Mark Sutton : Hi, Adam. That's a lot of hypotheticals in terms. We don't - well, first of all, we don't think paper demand will stay at the level of that, it will recover probably not 100% of what the COVID impact did to it, but some of it will recover as schools and offices open to some degree more than they are now. You're right. We took Riverdale out, not knowing that this was coming, but it actually was a benefit because it reduced our supply in the face of a real big demand decline. I've said this before and will continue to be our guiding principle, on containerboard conversions, we'll only make investments in containerboard production whether it's a conversion or a Greenfield or anything else. Based on the box and containerboard market, we won't do that based on the issue than another product line like uncoated free sheet in this question. Sometimes the timing doesn't match up perfectly. And you don't want to make a bad decision with an asset. But that's really what would drive it. So right now, we've got the ability, we haven't done it in a while, because we typically run the uncoated free sheet relatively full. But we have the ability to throttle that business with the same techniques we use in our containerboard business, so that we can adjust our output to the demand we have. And obviously, we've never thought the demand was coming back, we would make some more permanent decisions than carrying the cost of the economic downtime as we call it, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But what you need to know though is the principle for making more containerboard is about making more boxes, not about another asset that needs something to do. Adam Josephson : Sure. And I appreciate that Mark. And just one on the box business, so you have a slide in your presentation in which you compare economic indicators to box demand, obviously, the tightest correlation is with a non-durable industrial production. And as you know, CPG volumes this year have been extraordinary, because of COVID. I think P&G had 16% U.S. sales growth, which is almost unheard of. And we've seen that all year. So I'm just wondering, what you would extrapolate from this years' experience in terms of box demand, if anything? I mean, obviously, consumers behavior has been so unusual in so many ways that I find it hard to extrapolate much of anything into future years unless we continue to be stuck at home for years to come. What are you extrapolating into next year from this years' experience? Mark Sutton : Well, a couple of things on the non-durables. I think correlation still holds. I believe box performance is outperforming non-durables, because so much of the non-durable collection of markets segments is not box intensive. Some of those non-durable items are actually down and the box intensive portions of non-durable goods is up a lot. So, I think the correlations been a whole, I hope, and I think we're not going to be locked in our homes. So, some of this demand and channel movement will settle out. Couple of takeaways that are just sitting here today, I didn't think we've been at this long enough. And some of our customers are saying is that some consumer behavior changes will be pretty sticky. I think people are going to eat and go out a little different. So I think some of the demand and shifts in the food channel are going to stay with us, maybe not a 100%. And then secondly, we have a lot of first time new adopters to doing business in an e-commerce kind of way. And I think those people have had good experiences largely. And some of the retail channel will continue to be in an e-commerce kind of channel. And for us or IP given the investments we made and the position we have, we believe that's a positive. The rest of it's tough to call. Probably it settled out to something like we had before. But given this wasn't a one month or two-month issue, I think behaviors and habits are beginning to change. And it will probably last a while. Adam Josephson : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of a George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks for the details. Thanks for taking our question. My first question was just kind of a tag on to Adam's question. What we've been trying to push companies on during earnings season so far is what change and behavior has occurred that we'll be sticking to use your term's mark on a going forward basis, specifically e-commerce because of COVID? And so, I don't know that you're in a position at this juncture six months into this to determine what the incremental pickup might be from this change behavior. But if you had any initial goalposts, that your customers are sharing with you, or again if you could affirm where you think this increase in demand will be most likely to say at this new normal level? That would be great. And then I had a quick question on operations. Mark Sutton : Well, George, as Tim said, when you take everything into account box demand in a bit of a crazy year is upper percent. The year wasn't so crazy, maybe even normal correlations are there and box demand is about the same amount or 0.5% or 1.5% the range we've seen in the last couple of years. I think, if some of this e-commerce activity does remain and we believe it will because of what I said about first adopters and people buying things they never bought before. That tends to drive some incremental purchases in some cases. I think the big unknown is how fast if ever do people fully returned to the way they spent money before and the things they spent money on fuel, heavy travel, the service industry, that discretionary income tends to be now flowing into consuming goods, whether it's home improvement goods, luxury items, or basic necessities of food and supplies for your home. And that is a much more box intensive way to spend money from our perspective. And we believe that our level of that will continue well beyond when the all clear and sounded. George Staphos : Understood. We'll keep evaluating. You mentioned some of the things that you're investing in earlier in the presentation. Are there areas that you can share at this juncture, capabilities that you need to further invest in to continue to participate and lead in this new world relative to corrugated? Again, maybe it's additional printing capability, maybe it's more I don't know how the small box initiative worked on e-commerce, but maybe it's more investments like that. Is there anything that you feel from a platform standpoint and really more on converting that you need to invest in? And then on the mill side, we've seen a dramatic drop off in demand and then a dramatic resurgence in demand. You're not alone. Other companies have also pulled in some of their maintenance, probably because you can't get people to facilities because of COVID. What are you doing now to make sure as especially on the mill side, to keep the reliability, you avoid unplanned outages because this is a lot of stress on a very, very capital intensive and important portion of your business? Mark Sutton : George, those are two great questions. Let me get the investment opportunity. We basically said it's almost all in converting, it has a lot to do with small box and e-commerce configured plants the physical profile of an e-commerce blank for a box is smaller, so most efficiently run on the right size machines. So we've actually evolved to a percentage of our several hundred box plants are becoming e-commerce-oriented plants. And they look different. And if we ever build a new one from the ground up, which I think we probably will, it will look different physically as well building size, and you'll have more of those located right near the fulfillment centers. And that's where our investment opportunity is. There's always an opportunity and we continue to see it to improve printing capability. And we were investing in that. And then sometimes it's just pure capacity. We don't have enough box making capacity in a certain region of the country. And we have to add it organically or inorganically and you've seen us do it both ways. With respect to the investment question in the mills, we are blessed to have 16 containerboard mills, now 16.5 if you take out for Riverdale. We have a big system that's flexible. It is going to be wide open sometimes, like 2018. And it'll be less than that, like it was in 2019. We're always going to try to keep that balance. So we're going to look at it over a several year period and decide whether we have too much or not enough capacity. Investing in the reliability, you set aside the recycled mills, which don't have the complexity of a pulp mill, and a power generation unit, those are pretty easy to manage in reliability spending. It's mostly about reliability and the paper machine. And we do that through largely non-capital investments. On the integrated mills that take in wood, make their own energy and pulpwood, that's where the big maintenance capital is and that's where the risk management is. So we have a hierarchy process, where we - when we cut back on maintenance - we don't cut back on the maintenance, that could result in multiple days down. Usually that's in power generation, for in pulping. And so we would do that work. And we would forego some work that's in the paper machine area that even if it failed, our teams can get it back up and running with a repair albeit may be costly, but a repair within 24 hours or so. So that's how we approach that, something that we just have a risk management framework that doesn't leave our mills subject to major large outages. George Staphos : Mark, that's great. I appreciate the thoughts. Good luck in the quarter. I'll turn it over. Mark Sutton : Thank you, George. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Just similar to what Gabe laid off with, so you guys used to talk a lot about industry structure and behavior in the context of containerboard. And I think the results demonstrate how important that is in generating good returns. And I would also think that the structure in fluff pulp or absorb fibers is equally compelling. So when you hit your 85-15 target mix, do you think the returns in cellulose will be similar to what you're doing and Industrial Packaging? Mark Sutton : Steve, I think our goal is to get the Cellulose Fibers business to the cost of capital. But the Industrial Packaging businesses probably got higher returns, and probably always will. There's a couple of differences though the market in Industrial Packaging is a lot bigger. Fluff pulp is a smaller market. So it's residing in a very large pulp ecosystem, softwood market pulp, hardwood pulp, and then specialties at the top and pure commodities at the bottom. So it's got a lot of activity around it. So inside of that segment, the structure looks really good. But outside of the segment, there's a lot of activity. And that does play out overtime. But our goal is to get it solidly to the cost of capital through a cycle that's part of margin on the revenue and profit side on the top. And that's part on just reducing our costs and then finally, the right mix as you mentioned, on the 85-15. We see a path to getting it there that'll correspond to some level of EBITDA. There's opportunities for us to work on the footprint, as I think Gabe asked as well. And we have plans to do all of that. Steve Chercover : Well, I thought that IP had evolved to the point where earning your cost of capital wasn't enough, you had to be generating in excess for it to be compelling. Mark Sutton : Yeah. That is correct. We believe that the best value creation, if you look at S&P 500 companies that perform the best and have first quartile TSR, they tend to have a 200 basis points spread from their cost of capital. So, we did that with the entire company. And if you followed us for a while, International Paper as a whole wasn't met its cost of capital. So the first goal is get it there. And then you build the spread. And we fully expect to be able to do that. And by the way, we have a spread to our cost of capital and in the entire company now. And that's our goal in each component of the company, but it won't be democratic and linear. There will be some parts of the company that have a five or 10 year run well above cost of capital. There'll be others that are right at cost of capital. But you've seen us take action on businesses and parts of businesses that we've concluded. We don't think we're the right owner to get it there. Steve Chercover : Sure, and then switching to containerboard. I was just wondering if you could quantify the financial impacts and I know that they're already calibrated into the guidance. But how much of those hurricanes in that direct show in Iowa hurt you in the second quarter or sorry, in Q3? How would you characterize your inventories? And then finally on containerboard, are you - do you said you're going faster than the market or are you still walking away from some suboptimal business? Tim Nicholls : So our inventories were pretty low at the moment and I think we referenced that in some of the prepared remarks just in terms of how we manage the channels during the quarter. Where we had to, we pulled back in some areas around to export, because we had such strong demand in North America. And now, we've given the flexibility of the system and the ability to recover, we're on a better footing. And so, we're increasing volume to the export channels in the fourth quarter, which is good, because it's seasonally stronger anyway. On the first part of your question, just in terms of the storms, through all of our operations and everything and being able to flex back and forth and move our widgets around, we feel like we offset us the impact. So, on a net-net basis not much. Steve Chercover : And the final question was, were you walking away for some business, it's just not lucrative enough? Tim Nicholls : We always manage our mix. We don't talk about how we handle segments or customers. But yeah, we're always trying to improve the quality of our mix across all of our businesses. Steve Chercover : Great. Many thanks. Tim Nicholls : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Great. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. I wondered, could either of you just help us in kind of unbundling sort of what the activity in your box business has been by different markets this year? And in particular, I guess, how much that e-commerce business has grown for IP year-to-date? Mark Sutton : Well, Mark we don't give absolute numbers on that. But if you remember what I said last quarter, it was a cumbersome way to say it, but I think I said orders of magnitude double-digit growth. So, we were growing in double-digit percentages with a one in front of it, for 2020. And we are significantly higher than that in growth. And that number, or that range that I talked about in the second quarter - on the second quarter call continues to be in the same range and a little bit stronger. So, this is significant uptick from let's say '19 and '18 and '17, where we were at double-digit levels and it's just several times that. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then just on supply in both the container board and boxes. Can you talk about how you're managing, particularly that Newport Indiana mill, because I think I had heard that you might be shifting that out of containerboard and back to gypsum basic diaper? And then also just where you're at on the box capacity, because I'm getting some reports from people who say, IP is so full right now, but they're farming out business independent converters. Mark Sutton : I'm going to ask Tim to cover some of that detail. Yeah, it's a pretty dynamic environment. Your memory is pretty good on Newport. So Tim, why don't you take us through that? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Thanks Mark. Mark, Newport was the facility that produced not only white-top liner - recycled white-top liner, but also just some facing board. So if you remember, when we decided to make the investment in Riverdale, not only did we get a better sheet, divergent sheet, better brightness, color and smoothness, but it frees up the Newport facility. Overtime, we've dedicated to the gypsum product fully. And we like that market, and we really appreciate the customers we have in it and we think its good business for us. Mark Sutton : On your question about the box business, we - as you know, Mark, we provide containerboard primarily to our own box system, but also to the open market where we have long-term partners, whether they're making sheets and then feeding the sheet plant network. And so, if that's what your farming outcome it makes, that's not new for us. We have partners in every type of channel that ultimately gets to a box. And I would say all of those channels are very busy and very strong right now for us. So, that may be what you're picking up I'm not sure. Mark Wilde : Okay. And last one for me, Mark. Just to help us with modeling as we think about this price increase. Is it reasonable to assume that all your corrugated volume has some lengths to the pulp and paper weak indexes? And if not, what percent of the business might be on other mechanisms? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. There's a big part of the market that is linked to our references, it's not direct, but references movement in the published price lists or index. But we don't talk publicly about what those percentages are. We have a variety of customers where prices, its set on a time increment basis and contracts are written around those types of price mechanism. So, not 100% varies by customer and sometimes by segment as well. Steve Chercover : Okay, that's helpful. Tim, I'll turn it over. Tim Nicholls : Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our last question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thanks. I'll try to keep this quick. You mentioned the higher wood and energy costs in the pulp segment. Was the wood cost mostly weather related or was there something else there? Tim Nicholls : No, I think it was mostly weather, Mark. Mark Connelly : Okay. Okay. And then just very last question. I'm just trying to do a little bit of math. In North America, did your containerboard system run full if you exclude the impacts you had with Hurricane maintenance? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I mean like I said, inventories are on the low side right now. And we're working hard to cover customer commitments, we even pulled back and redirected from the export channel, where we could. So yeah, we're running as hard as we can right now. Mark Connelly : That's perfect. Thank you very much. Tim Nicholls : Thanks Mark. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chairman and CEO, Mark Sutton for closing remarks. Mark Sutton : Thank you, operator. What I'd like to do just to wrap up is first, thank everyone for joining the call today. I really want to thank our employees, as I mentioned earlier especially our frontline employees who are showing up every day, taking care of themselves, each other and our customers. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter. And I'm really excited about our strong outlook and the momentum that we're building as we finish up 2020 when we start to look into 2021. So again, thank you for your interest in International Paper and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's International Paper's third quarter 2020 earnings day call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Guillermo Gutierrez. Please go ahead Sir. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, slide two also provides context around the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on Slide three with full-year 2020 results. [indiscernible] impacts of the pandemic in 2020 reaffirms my admiration and appreciation for our employees and their ongoing commitment to take care of each other and to take care of our customers. I am really proud of the outstanding collaboration across our commercial, supply chain and manufacturing teams to adapt to our customer's rapidly changing needs. We ran our manufacturing system well and leveraged the flexibility of our newly converged systems to overcome significant challenges due to the pandemic while managing cost extremely well across our three businesses. Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2020. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered the company's eleventh consecutive year of value creating tenants [ph]. Our performance demonstrate the strength and resilience of our employees, our diverse customer base and our world class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Given the significant economic uncertainty, we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash generation and enhance our financial strength. On capital allocation, we're choices consistent with our capital allocation framework. We retained $1.7 million of debt, converted strength in our balance sheet, we're also seeing significant benefits in our pension plan from the actions that we took to de-risk the plan during the past few years, which contributed to a 95% funding model in yearend 2020. Also in 2020, we returned $800 million to our shareholders and we continue to invest in our North American and EMEA business to enhance our capabilities and grow our earnings. We're really excited about the path returning to build a better IP. We're building our strength of our corrugated packaging business and taking meaningful actions to drive sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders. In a few minutes, I'll discuss some of the investments we way right away to deliver on our commitment. Turning to full-year results on Slide four, we delivered EBITDA of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Lower year-over-year sales was driven by the decline in printing papers demand through the market disruptions from the global pandemic. Earnings were impacted by lower demand for paper as well as lower average pricing for packaging and cellulose fibers. These were partially offset by strong volume growth in our packaging business, outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage expense. In 2020 we made choices about planned maintenance and other spending priorities to mitigate the impact of market disruptions. Our equity earnings were $77 million including $48 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was impacted by challenging tough markets and a non-cash foreign exchange loss of $50 million. For the full-year we received a $141 million is dividends from Ilim. Across International Paper, we proactively managed cash levers to deliver another year of outstanding cash generation. Moving to Slide five, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established three principles to focus on what we needed to do as a company to remain strong and resilient for all of our stakeholders. First was to keep our employees and contractors safe. Second was to take care of our customers and third was to maintain the financial strength of the company and I believe International Paper executed extremely well against that success criteria. We did not experience any material operational disruptions due to COVID-19 while taking care of our customers. I'll turn to our employees, [indiscernible] remains our most important responsibility. Our performance reaffirms my appreciation for our 48,000 employees worldwide. We recognize our teams financially for their tenacity, commitment and resilience with a bonus totaling $25 million in the fourth quarter. I am also proud to work with them and to support the critical needs in our communities, which included the donation of two million corrugated boxes to agencies that have delivered essential food and supplies. We remain absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles and we'll continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short-term and in the long-term. Now I'll turn it over to Tim who will cover our business performance and our first quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I am on Slide six, which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Our 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with COVID-19. Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a significant headwind mostly due to the full year impact of 2019 in depth movement in our North American packaging business as well as lower average pricing in cellulose fibers and printing papers business. Volume was a drag on earnings due to the unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers. The impact was partly offset by strong volume in our packaging business, driven by higher demand across most consumer segments. We managed operations and cost well in a challenging environment with no material operational disruptions due to COVID-19. Our teams performed in a high level under a reconfigured work systems to protect our employees and contractors. We did experience higher operating and distribution cost in the latter part of the year as we flexed our systems to meet very strong packaging demand. Input cost were favorable for the full-year, driven by lower wood, energy cost and distribution cost, partly offset by higher recovered fiber cost. I'd also note the cost for wood recovered fiber energy and distribution increased in the fourth quarter. corporate items were favorable driven by outstanding cost management and lower interest expenses based on significant debt reduction. For the full year 2020, our operational tax rate was 25% compared to 26% in 2019 and equity earnings decreased due to lower Ilim earnings, which includes $0.13 of unfavorable FX impact. Turning to Slide seven, which shows our fourth quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.75 per share, which includes $0.05 impact related to the employee recognition bonus that Mark discussed earlier. Sales improved sequentially and came in better than our expectations driven by strong demand in our North American packaging business. EBITDA decreased due to the higher operating and input cost. As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow, which will continue to apply in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by about $600 million bringing our full-year 2020 debt reduction to $1.7 billion. Turning to the quarter-over-quarters earnings bridge on Slide eight, fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.75. Looking at the bridge, lower price mix was driven by prior period price flow driven packaging and cellulose fibers. Volume was favorable driven mostly by strong demand in corrugated packaging in North America and the EMEAs where the prior seasonal demand for papers in Brazil and Russian. Operations and costs were a significant headwind in the quarter. We experienced some reliability issues in our North American containerboard system most of which are behind us now. We also experience higher marginal operating and distribution cost to meet very strong packaging demand. We had a $20 million asset right off in cellulose fibers in the fourth quarter and as a reminder, our sequential earnings were impacted by the non-repeat of $30 million favorable items in the third quarter. I'd also like to note that the employee recognition bonuses reflected in operations in full which was allocated to each business. Input costs were unfavorable due to higher wood and recovered fiber, higher seasonal energy cost and higher distribution cost. We're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion and we expect recovered fiber and distribution cost to trend higher as we enter 2021. Higher corporate expenses reflects the effective tax rate of 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to 19% in the third quarter which included a favorable adjustment after finalizing our 2019 tax returns. Equity earnings include the noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.05 in the fourth for Ilim as compared to a $0.14 loss in the third quarter. Let me turn to the segments now and I'll start with industrial packaging on Slide nine. Volume improved sequentially across all regions with strong demand in North America outpacing the impact of the three less shipping days in the fourth quarter. We're seeing broad based demand strength across all of our channels including boxes, sheets and containerboard. Just about every consumer segment accelerated in the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in e-commerce and we believe the vast majority of e-commerce adoption is permanent. We're also seeing strong demand for consumer and durable goods, especially for building materials. Food service categories contains lag and the pace of recovery will depend on the restaurant and travel industry recovery. Export containerboard demand will also robust. We have strong backlogs as we have fright board, containerboard shipments to our integrated system here in North America to meet our customer's demands. Operations and costs were a significant headwind due to several factors. We experienced some isolated reliability issues late in the quarter, most of which are now behind us. We also faced higher costs in our mill and boxes to meet strong demand, including the impact of less optimal containerboard sourcing to our box plants. We also experienced our supply chain cost and over time with just about every box plant running on weekends. And lastly, recall that ops and cost includes the employee bonus we discussed earlier which for packaging represents about $15 million. Maintenance outage cost improved sequentially as planned. Input cost increased driven by higher recovered fiber, seasonal energy and distribution cost. Cost for recovered fiber and distribution continued as we enter the first quarter which reflects overall strength in demand we're seeing. Moving to global cellulose fibers on Slide 10, price and mix was unfavorable on the contract flow through of lower third quarter list price. Volume was stable, demand for fluff pulp improved late in the fourth quarter following the expected destocking. Operations and costs were impacted by a $20 million right off of capital and engineering costs following a review of the capital investment needs for the business. Maintenance outage increased and input costs were essentially flat. Taking a closer look at fluff pulp demand, as I mentioned, demand improved throughout the fourth quarter. Demand continued to improve as we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs for fluff pulp. In addition floor congestion is stretching supply chains due to the high levels of imports in the US Turning to printing papers on Slide 11, the business delivered earnings of $80 million in the fourth quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our North American, Brazilian and Russian regions delivered returns about the cost of capital. We continue to leverage our strong brands, our world class customer service and our low-cost system to maximize performance as we navigate a challenging demand environment. Looking at the fourth quarter performance, across the segment price and mix was stable. Volume improved sequentially across all regions with stronger seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia. We're seeing a gradual recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will celebrate with stronger return to office and return to school activity. Operations and cost includes higher seasonal energy consumption and the non-repeat of favorable items in the third quarter of about $10 million. Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by nearly 100,000 tons sequentially. Maintenance outages increased as expected and input cost increased primarily due to higher transportation and seasonal energy cost. Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12, the joint venture delivered $53 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 30% on improved commercial performance. Volume improved 16% year-over-year on strong softwood pulp exports. Pricing mix was also favorable with the price utilization for softwood accelerating in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter equity earnings include foreign exchange gain on Ilim's US dollar denominated net debt of which IP's after-tax portion was $22 million or five cents per share for the full year adjusted EBIT dollars $519 million which represents the 26% margin full-year 2020 equity earnings were $48 million which includes $50 million in foreign exchange loss on Ilim's US dollar denominated net debt of which IPs after tax portion was $22 million or $0.05 per share. For the full year adjusted EBITDA was $519 million which represents a 26% margin. Full year 2020 equity earnings were $48 million which includes a $15 million foreign exchange loss on Ilim's US dollar denominated net debt. Although 2020 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance and low-cost system make a powerful cash generator. We expect to receive about $100 million in dividends from Ilim in 2021. As Mark said in his opening remarks, we generated outstanding free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility in some of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation. Given the significant economic uncertainty because we pulled some of those cash levers to reinforce the company's financial strength. We executed well on the things that impact cash. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked in 2020 and choices that we made around our planned maintenance and other spending priorities. In the fourth quarter we also benefited from a tax refund claim which contributed $115 million to free cash flow. Our early actions and strong execution across the company enabled us to deliver another year of outstanding free cash flow. Turning to Slide 14, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2020 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper as we move forward. We'll maintain a strong balance sheet and we're committed to our current investment grade rating with a targeted debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times to 2.8 times on a Moody's basis. We're very pleased with the progress we've made on the balance sheet, debt and pension in 2020. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt and our pension GAAP improved by $500 million. Our pension plan is sufficiently funded. We closed 2020 with a healthy 95% funding level and we feel really good about the actions we've taken over the past few years to de-risk the plan. We closed 2020 at 2.9 times leverage. We're in a much better place and we're committed to getting to our target range. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2020, we returned $800 million to shareholders. Over the past five years, we returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, or just over 50% of our free cash flow. We remain committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a target range of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we review annually as earnings and cash flow growth. And we\u2019ll continue evaluating our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that share repurchase opportunities are weighed against other capital allocation options always with a commitment to maximize value creation. Investment excellence is central growing earnings and cash. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around $800 million. We\u2019ll continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pullback as circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build that capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth. We\u2019ll continue to assess discipline and selected M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging business in North America and Europe. Continuing on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on the 2006 timber monetization installment. After careful consideration, we decided not to extend the notes. When these notes mature in August of 2021, we expect to receive $630 million in cash, which represents our equity. We expect to paying about $75 million in taxes upon maturity of the timber notes. Now I\u2019ll turn to Slide 15 and our first quarter outlook. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong as we enter the first quarter. Demand for fluff pulp accelerated in the fourth quarter and that momentum continues in the first quarter. In printing papers, we\u2019re seeing a modest recovery in demand. But challenges will likely persist until we see a broad base return to offices and schools. Taking a closer look at industrial packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $65 million on the realization of our November 2020 price increase. Volume is expected to be flat sequentially, with strong box demand offset by one less shipping day in the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35 million. Staying with industrial packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $87 million and input costs are expected to increase by $30 million, mostly due to higher recovered fiber and distribution costs. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $15 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $6 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million, mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. Turning to printing papers, we expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $15 million on lower seasonal demand in Latin America and Russia. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $2 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million again mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. And under equity earnings, you\u2019ll see the outlook for Ilim joint venture. Coming back to planned maintenance outage expense for the full-year 2021, we plan $155 million of higher expenses. This increase includes deferrals we chose to make in our packaging mill system to meet strong customer demand as well as the impact of higher coal maintenance outages across facilities. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. I\u2019m on Slide 16 now, as we shared with you in December, we\u2019re taking meaningful actions to do better IP and accelerate profitable growth, we\u2019ll focus on Corrugated Packaging, we\u2019re committed to deliver $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings by the end of 2023. As part of our commitment, we\u2019ll deliver $50 million to $100 million of incremental annual earnings growth in our businesses through commercial execution and investment excellence. We\u2019ll also deliver $300 million in structural cost reduction, we have initiatives underway in three areas. First, we will streamline and simplify our organization to support a packaging focus company with a more focused geographic footprint. Second, we\u2019ll redesign processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics, and sourcing. And third, we\u2019re identifying opportunities to better optimize our fleet of assets to make the right products on the right assets to further improve our cost position and to be more efficient with our capital. As we move forward, we\u2019ll be sharing with you the multiple streams of earnings initiatives we have underway, and when you should expect to see them enhance our earnings. Today, let me describe one of the key enablers to delivering on our process in asset optimization cost savings. And as you notice on the slide, accounts were about 70% of our structural cost reduction target. We\u2019ll use new approaches that leverage technology and data analytics in our businesses. We established a dedicated team has been working closely with external partners and our businesses over the past year to identify, develop, and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities, which are now moving to scaled implementation. Turning to Slide 17, you can see a few areas where we're using data to provide greater visibility and actionable insights. These tools enable new approaches to optimize our value chain, from our mills to our box clients and ultimately to our customers. We expect these initiatives to deliver between $150 million and $200 million in annual earnings improvement. We\u2019re making excellent progress scaling up several of these initiatives and expect to realize about half of these benefits in 2022. Let me give you a few examples of what this looks like. We\u2019ll use real time data to optimize production scheduling across our box plants in North America. Although many of the benefits result in lower costs across our system, we\u2019ll also gain low cost incremental capacity in our box system to pursue profitable growth with very little incremental capital. We're also using third-party logistics technology to optimize transportation planning and reduce distribution costs in our box plants. In our Mills, we\u2019ll use continuous online monitoring and data analytics to improve fiber, chemical and energy consumption. In addition, online equipment monitoring will also enable us to predict potential equipment failures, improve reliability, and reduce our overall maintenance costs. And in sourcing, we have greater visibility and more effective tools across a broader set of our procurement activities. We\u2019ll use internal and external data to develop a more targeted catalog of sourcing options to drive savings in operating and repair materials. Working with our external partners, our team is moving quickly to scale these opportunities and integrate them into our business processes. Team is also working closely with our businesses to identify more opportunities. Let me close on Slide 18, our 2020 performance adds to my confidence in the path we're charting to build a better IP. We're motivated by the opportunities we have to accelerate value creation for our shareholders. Now, I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic and there's still significant uncertainty, International Paper strength and resilience endures. We're proud of the essential nature of our products that we make. Our employees have demonstrated commitment to take care of each other and our customers and that commitment continues. Our customers can count on International Paper to be there for them and deliver superior solutions and our communities can count on us to be responsible partners to improve the lives of the people who depend on us. We have an exciting and ambitious agenda. We\u2019ll continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company in the short-term and in the long-term for all of our stakeholders. With that, we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey, good morning, everyone. How should we think about inflation, when we think about 2021, particularly some of these bigger buckets, you've called out that's more volatile whether it\u2019s freight and OCC, and certainly really good to see operation costs improve sequentially. But are there any costs like distribution for example, that we should be expecting to be more elevated, just given how strong demand is? Mark Sutton : So, we think about inflation in a couple of ways, we have general inflation of employee wage increases and general materials and operating materials. And that roughly runs around $200 million a year for us, it can be a little bit more, a little bit less. On the input side, of course, we track those quarter-by-quarter. And it's really driven by what's happening in the market. So in the moment, given transportation, we see that as a bit of a headwind, just given the economic activity that we're experiencing across the country, spot rates on truck are elevated. As I mentioned in the speaker notes, congestion across most of the transportation modes. So we'll have to see how it plays out. And some of it is driven marginally by just the incremental demand growth that we're seeing in a moment and sourcing transportation to make sure we get it to customers on time. So yes, it's a bit of a headwind. Philip Ng : Got it. That's helpful. And then I noticed that most of your maintenance downtime, particularly in your Corrugated segment in North America was going to be first half loaded. It sounds like demand is still really strong and markets pretty tight to begin with. So just want to get some comfort on, do you have enough inventory to kind of meet demand and give us a little flavor how lead times and backlogs are looking right now? Mark Sutton : Well, we've got long backlogs, extended backlogs in the export channel. As we mentioned, we've been pivoting and prioritizing that to the North American market through our Integrated system. I would say our inventories are lean right now. And we will manage our outages accordingly to balance outage time and customer demand and the need for more. But we ran very lean in the back half of 2020. We still see pressure. Philip Ng : Okay, thanks a lot. Really appreciate the color, guys. Mark Sutton : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, Mark, Tim. Hope all you\u2019re well. Mark Sutton : Hi, Gabe. Gabe Hajde : I guess the first question would be on industrial volume trends. And I think from the outlook in terms of flat would seem to imply kind of 1.5% growth directionally on a per day basis. Can you comment at all as sort of what you're seeing currently, and then given the difficult March comp, how you would kind of expect that to progress just given what you're seeing in your backlogs? Mark Sutton : We're continuing, Gabe to see the kind of demand profile we saw in the fourth quarter continued through the month of January. We expect based on the backlogs we have, based on our conversations with our customers, even though the comps are going to be harder starting in March, we expect on an absolute basis strong market. And that's why it's really critical that we manage what Phil was asking about which is the supply we have available of containerboard and box plant capacity with the demand we're going to have and also navigate the necessary maintenance outages. But the market for our customer order book is really strong. Gabe Hajde : All right, thank you, Mark. And then flipping gears kind of quickly to the [indiscernible] ramp-up. There wasn't much commentary or anything in the prepared remarks. Just curious how that ramped-up for you and is helping kind of ease some of those inventory pressures that you're seeing, any incremental costs and do that kind of contribute to the difference relatively to our model to what we were expecting in terms of profit? Tim Nicholls : Yes, thanks for the question. It's going extremely well. We're ahead of our ramp curve, ramp curve will continue building through 2021. But really pleased with how the machine is running and the quality, we\u2019re getting off of it so far. Operator : All right, and our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Mark, good morning. Mark Wilde : Mark is best you can, I'd like to talk about any impact on IP from this cyber attack at one of your largest peers. And maybe also, what IP is doing to defend itself from similar things? Mark Sutton : Well, that seems like cyber issues are in the news almost every day, we haven't had any material impact related to any cyber issues. We\u2019re working constantly with our information technology process control at our Chief Information Security Officer and our board to make sure we're staying ahead of the curve. And there's a lot of techniques Mark, every company's got approaches and outside help. But what we've focused on is making sure our manufacturing network where it's connected and needs to be connected, and where it doesn't need to be connected, it's not connected. So it's a hybrid of connectivity to share data that's necessary to share and a distributed system when it's not necessary to share. So isolating into sectors, the different potential entry points. On the business, back office systems, again using our own and third-party sticker protection protocols. But it's a moving target. And we\u2019re continuously working on it. And we always feel, I think it's a healthy way to feel that we're behind. So that keeps us laser focused on it. Tim Nicholls : Mark, I\u2019d just add. The other piece of it Mark is from a disaster recovery and business continuity standpoint, those are things that we run drills on a regular basis to hopefully make sure that we're able to recover, should we have an attack Mark is right. There's a huge dose of humility in all this stuff. Mark Wilde : Is there any impact on just like slops that you do sort of amongst companies to kind of minimize freight costs? I mean, one of the things we hear about is that there's issues with shipping from some of those sites right now? Mark Sutton : I really can't comment on the company you're talking about, but I'll tell you\u2026 Mark Wilde : I talk about IP though, does this have any effect, impact on IP because somebody's not able to meet this as a one-off? Mark Sutton : We haven't seen any. Sorry, I misunderstood your question. We haven't seen any impact. We are, it's all we can do with or without those disruptions to supply all of the channels to market that we have demand for right now. But no, Mark, we haven't seen anything that's affected us in a noticeable way. Mark Wilde : Okay. Understood, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Hey, my first question, Mark. And we're not going to hold you to this, but just want to get a sense for as you look at global cellulose fibers, and hopefully, a better demand outcome as we go into \u201821. And what looks to be a better market pricing across all the cellulose market. Do you think the business can turn profitable this year? Or does more work needs to be done either in terms of demand, cost, commercial efforts? How would you have us think about that not looking for the quarter, but just conceptually, do you think the business now is at a level of profitability that, we can see some positive numbers at some point? Mark Sutton : I think the answer is yes. You'll see positive numbers at some point. I mean, the reason we didn't go beyond the first quarter with anything specific is because of the uncertainty and the likelihood that no one really knows how things are going to play out until we get this pandemic under control. But what do you want to be looking at and what we're looking at is continuous improvement in cellulose fibers on all fronts. We've got some internal things that we can do, and we're working on them to improve our cost, position, post the integration of Warehouser and IP, and then there's the market pricing, volume selected customers, and all that is moving in a positive direction right now. What I can't predict sitting here today is the rate but you'll see quarter-after-quarter more positive results and the business is getting start gaining some momentum and we're beginning to turn that corner now. George Staphos : Okay, Mark, thanks for the comments there. And I wanted to kind of a longer-term question with you here. So if we go to the slide that you and Tim were discussing on longer-term cash flow, the compound rate of growth over 10 years has been something around 3%, which is quite good given the capital intensity of the business and a lot of the challenges that you've had to consider over time, when you think about the outlook over the next five years, next let's keep it to five years, given the demand pickup that you've gotten from e-commerce, given some of the optimization opportunities you're working on. But also given what might be a more inflationary environment, what would you advise investors and analysts to think about in terms of your growth rate and cash flow over the next five to 10 years? Should it be accelerating? Is it 3%? And qualitatively, what would be the biggest drivers of that outlook? Thank you. Mark Sutton : George, that's a really great question, a little heavy for a quarterly earnings call. But it's a fair question. George Staphos : I figured I'd give that up a little bit. Mark Sutton : Perfect, we always want more strategic questions. And our objective of building a better IP is obviously to generate consistent, credible earnings growth. And that's going to have a positive effect on cash. But I am sitting here with my CFO who really wants to answer this question. So Tim, why don't you? Tim Nicholls : Well, I want to just give a little bit of perspective. So Mark's, right. I mean, the key is growing earnings and that should grow cash. But the other things that we're working on that we have mentioned, is our capital investment process and making sure that we\u2019re more robust about how we deploy capital. Hopefully, that's going to lead to higher returns from projects we do and fewer projects, where they don't meet the criteria that they need to meet. And so on balance, we should get more for less cash. The other places just what Mark talked about earlier, some of these technology driven earnings improvement opportunities are giving us capability around both capability and capacity without the normal capital investment dollar on the front-end. So I thought it was worth highlighting that. George Staphos : All right, thanks, Tim. I'll turn it over. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : I have a question on the port delays and supply chain congestion impacting cellulose fibers. Just wondering if there's any detail you can give in terms of how that sort of stands in February. And in terms of potential impact to 1Q, you talked about non-repeats on in the outlook slide, I think you said $35 million improved ops and cost, is supply chain in ports a big part of that sequential improvement, just wondering, there's no finer points to put them? Mark Sutton : Well, I think, it's yet to be determined. But that is we do expect that to improve. It's part of it, but we haven't seen the improvement really take hold in any meaningful and meaningful way. Maybe it's in a way a result of the impressive demand improvement. So I think it usually works itself out through the quarter. And we\u2019re hopefully beginning to see that. And so we can get our product all the way to market. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, and maybe just related question. I mean, can you talk about the current pulp market conditions, especially in China, I mean, we're seeing some price increases and spot prices there that are pretty eye popping. Could you just talk about what's driving that, maybe the sustainability and then if you could just remind us in terms of IP Cellulose Fibers business and then from Ilim, what percentage of your shipments in pulp go to China versus North America versus other parts of the world? Mark Sutton : So I mean, what we see generally in China, so in our cellulose fibers, fluff pulp, we\u2019re selling, we\u2019re inside that whole softwood pulp market environment. The Chinese economy is improving, paperboard production is increasing, and that's increasing the need for softwood pulp which improves the entire market supply and demand and dynamics and that flows to fluff pulp. So we think it's the broader Chinese economy improving, it looks to be sustainable as China seems to be first in really recovering from the economic impacts of the pandemic. Most of Ilim, I think your second part of your question was the Northern softwood that Ilim makes, almost all of what Ilim makes, goes to China, if not all of it. There could be a couple of other markets that are not technically China, but it's all China and the Greater Asian market in that area because remember, Anthony our two pulp mills are in Siberia. So we've shipped directly, virtually nothing goes anywhere else. Anthony Pettinari : Great. And then IP\u2019s kind of cellulose fiber footprint proper in terms of U.S. versus China versus rest of world? Mark Sutton : Yes, so to China, if memory serves I think it\u2019s roughly 30% of what we should virtually everything goes offshore. We have some customers here in North America, but 80% of what we make goes offshore somewhere either to Europe, or to China. I think China, if I remember correctly, is roughly 30% for the absorbents. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Mark, and Tim, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, one on the price mix guidance you gave for industrial packaging, it implies about $20 a ton of higher prices sequentially. So assuming you didn't realize much of the November increase in the fourth quarter, for obvious reasons, then that would suggest that cumulatively, you\u2019ll have realized maybe half of the $50 increase by 1Q, if am I thinking about it correctly? And is that the typical length of time that it takes you to realize these price increases? Any more detail you could give would be helpful? Tim Nicholls : Yes, sure. Two things one, first of all, in the fourth quarter, we had last residual of the price published down impact from January in the fourth quarter. So a very small percentage of these things have a lag effect that takes few quarters to work through, I would characterize our price realization on the containerboard and box price increase, that was announced in November as following a typical pattern, it usually takes a couple of quarters, for the majority of it to flow through, but then there is a residual that will continue into the third and the fourth quarter of this year. But it's no different than what we've experienced in past increases, we're expecting the same type in curve. Adam Josephson : Got it and then also related to guidance, Tim. Normally this time of year, you give full-year EBITDA guidance, obviously, you did not do so this time, can you talk about, how strongly you consider giving guidance and why you ultimately chose not to? And because obviously we know what the price impact could be, you have your idea of what costs inflation could be, you know if maintenance will be up, corporate will be up. So, obviously, you've got some of the pieces. So just wondering what your thought process was there? Tim Nicholls : It's a great question. So from a technical standpoint, we don't really give guidance, we provide an outlook. And you're correct, we have in prior-years, given a rough outline for what our expectations were in the coming year. If you'd asked me that question in October about what we would do right now, I would have probably been in a different place. But I think with COVID stretching longer than we imagined, vaccines not coming into play to as greater degree is what was forecasted. We didn't see at this point in time, a reason to change our practice from the past few quarters. I'm hopeful that as things play out in the first quarter, maybe second quarter, we'll have much more clarity, and we can start looking a little bit longer-term. But that was the rationale around thinking about our outlook for this call for the first quarter. Adam Josephson : Thanks a lot, Tim. Operator : Okay, our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Two follow-ups, first on the capital spend, it really is noticeable that you've been able to bring down that spend and apparently get what you need done. In particular 2020, it was only 430 on maintenance and regulatory. Is that do you think that type of number is sustainable? What's really a good number for you to meet those needs on maintenance and regulatory? And kind of more generally, what should we be thinking about or where do you think you are as to how much you need to spend to effectively run in place, so to offset inflation and then presumably anything above that would drive growth through cost reduction, strategic et cetera? Tim Nicholls : Yes, it's a great question. So I would say that our maintenance capital investment in 2020 was on the low side. We try to optimize and maximize every dollar that we put into the facilities and do it in a targeted way. But we have cycles, something, some types of maintenance are due on a calendar basis, because certifications are required and whatnot, we're looking at some of that, this year or just on a higher cycle. We also took it as an opportunity, given the unusual nature of last year as we reference to think a little bit differently about to what extent and how we would deploy maintenance outages across the fleet. So the trend would or the, the normalized, if you will, would be higher than last year. But with the offsets that we mentioned earlier, we\u2019re trying to become more efficient on capital and some of these predictive reliability capabilities are giving us an opportunity over time, we think to anticipate a problem before it actually happens, which should yield a lower cost, whether it's capital or expense in our facilities. Mark Sutton : So Mark, this class comment you made is really important. And I made this point a few calls ago, we really look at maintenance in totality. So there's a capital expenditure component. But there's an expense component that oftentimes is 2x and capital components. So when we look at lowering the cash needed to run in place, as you say, to maintain today's earnings and cash flow, we look at the total number. And sometimes well placed capital expenditures can significantly and dramatically lower your ongoing expenses. And the company would be better off and the cash generation profile would be better off. So we're constantly looking at that, what's exciting about some of these new technological approaches is we can probably if we're successful, save not only on CapEx, so it's mostly condition based, not time or inspection based, but also on the expense side. So there's a huge multiplier if we get it right. Mark Weintraub : Thank you and I definitely appreciate the complexity. So maybe a different way to ask would be with what you spent last year on both capital and as you said, the maintenance et cetera that gets expensed. Would you say that you were at a level that was meeting that run in place, maybe above it, or because of the unusual environment had you elected to go below it? Mark Sutton : I think we were at a level that allowed us to run in place. I answered that without knowing the impact of every decision we made because it's a continuum, we made choices to do and not do certain things in 2020, because of the pandemic influenced disruptions on the market. Some of those look like they've been good decisions. Some of those may end-up being bad decisions in the month of April. And we realized something we didn't do created a disruption. So you have to constantly look at it on a continuum basis. But I feel like the combination of capital and expense and the performance we delivered and continue to deliver albeit a couple of operating issues in the fourth quarter that we struck about the right balance. Mark Weintraub : Great, thank you. And then just on pulp, a quick follow-up. Recognizing there's a lot of volatility and predictability. Two questions. One is on Ilim, you have not that much of a change in the equity and earnings for the first quarter versus the fourth quarter given what we have seen in the Chinese spot market sectors sort of seemed a bit surprising. I know if there's any color you can add on that. And then second, is there a methodology you would provide for us on the outside to think about how to translate what we see in list prices, to what flows through and how quickly it flows through into your Cellulose Fibers results for the North American operations? Mark Sutton : So on global cellulose fibers, just start there, we have a fairly predictable and normal over time, ramp curve on containerboard. The pulp business is different, it has a different set of dynamics, we have different segments of customers, contracts vary across the customer base and our experience has been over the past few years that the price increases tend to take longer to work their way through to the bottom line. So confident in the price increases that we put out there but it always takes time for them to be fully realized. On Ilim, I think most of what you're seeing contributed to plan is just, it's just FX and expectations around FX. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Incorporated. Mark Connelly : I was hoping we can talk about pulp a little more long-term. Soft demand tends to be pretty reliable and markets pretty attractive growth character, but the returns over time tend to be really inconsistent. We saw that with some of the assets long before you brought them. Is it realistic to think that there is going to be a time when contract terms start to delink from commodity pulp or have that specification barriers broken down because of the vast pulp processing. I am really trying to understand how you think about the long-term profile of pulp when we think about that in contrast to what you\u2019ve accomplished in containerboard? Mark Sutton : It's a great question Mark. The commercial strategy that we deployed and it looks like the market deployed was clubbed for a long time was an external product on top of the broad pulp offering. It's now becoming a real market on its own and probably a different commercial approach, that's always difficult when she started one way to change but that is naturally our objective to change the way we value the product and to make sure we understand that we're getting appropriate value for what the product and service we provide. It will take some time but I think the downside is not improving is that the investment in making sure that product is available long-term will be much attractive and I think most markets if the product is really valuable and the technical specifications are really important and it seems that they are, it usually can correct over time, but it's not easy and you made a good point. Mark Connelly : Okay. And if we can just sweep, your process optimization program, I was just trying to understand how it differs from what you\u2019ve done before because we tend to think of IP as a leader in process management especially containerboard. So it's focused on different things really just bringing new technology. I am thinking back to Carol Roberts seven-year program. Mark Sutton : That's a fair remark. There's always opportunity to improve and we have systems and capabilities across few organizations that has helped us manage to where we are today. We're seeing new opportunities to use data in a different way and different types of data to make real-time decisions. So for instance, you think about the supply chain from fiber to the mills, containerboard to box plants and then the customers and thinking about how we manage board combinations across our system based on availability and where to arbitrage transportation for fiber cost is an opportunity that we think we can really exploit and so the tools are giving us a way to compare options that are just quite frankly too complicated to do in the moment by hand and we're building technology tools that will help us do that and they better trade off decisions. Mark Connelly : I appreciate it and obviously IP has been a leader in that space and nice to see you making more progress. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our last question will come from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : In terms of the OCC prices, we've seen there's run up a bid recently, can you just give us a sense of the expectation for how OCC prices evolved through 2021 as well as longer term and then this is how the Chinese ban of OCC imports, it seems that it has taken a shortage of fiber. Do you have any thoughts on whether it's kind of tangled stick and how they will grow out their fiber needs going forward? Mark Sutton : We couldn\u2019t hear exactly, I think you asked about OCC prices, but you broke up a little bit at the beginning of your question. Is that what you're asking OCC prices? Neel Kumar : Yeah, I was just asking about what's your type of strategy at OCC in 2021 is the longer term? Mark Sutton : 2021 the crystal ball is not that clear going out towards the second half of the year. In the quarter, we expect the trend that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue in the first and so on average I think we're expecting $15 to $20, maybe a little bit more than that on OCC but it really will depend in such a fastly acting market to circumstances and conditions. So we'll have to see what happens as we go from first into second quarter. Neel Kumar : Great and then just in terms of China's ban on OCC imports, do you think that's going to stick or how does it address their fiber needs going forward? Mark Sutton : Well we've inherently always, we've said, we've taken their word and I think you've already seen the market is beginning to adjust and is just adjusting last year and maybe even late 2019 in anticipation of this. So I think you see some of that rotation from one fiber time to another in China and you see a rebalancing across other export markets for OCC. So yeah, I think that probably stays in place. Neel Kumar : Great. Thank you. Guillermo Gutierrez : So thanks everyone for joining us today and for the call -- for the questions, excuse me. Just a closing comment, we are excited about what's in front of us with International Paper. We have strong demand in packaging and cellulose fibers business. Our paper business is recovering. We're still navigating the pandemic, but as I said in my comments, I have total confidence in our employees to be able to continue to do that. We have improving market conditions and so we're excited about the way 2021 is going to unfold and lead us into a very strong position as we enter 2022 and what I'm very hopeful is a pandemic-free economic playing field. So thank you again for your interest in International Paper. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's International Paper fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn today's conference call over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  There's important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our first quarter 2021 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investment, Slide 2 provides context around the financial information and measures presented on those entities. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings and strong cash generation in the first quarter. Our mill and converting system performed well to mitigate the significant impact of the winter storm and support a strong customer demand across all of our packaging channels. Input costs and transportation were a headwind in the first quarter, especially for energy, which was impacted by the duration of the severe cold temperatures in the Southern U.S.  We see momentum building, continuing to build across our 3 businesses with very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for absorbent pulp. And in papers, we're seeing an improved supply-demand backdrop in all of our key geographies.  Our capital allocation in the first quarter, we repaid $108 million of debt and we returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases.  Our performance again demonstrates the agility and resilience of International Paper to perform well across many different circumstances. We're passing the 1-year mark of the global pandemic, and I could not be any prouder of the commitment of our employees to take care of each other and take care of our customers. The vast majority of our 48,000 team members work in our mills and conversion plants each and every day, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility.  We also made solid progress on the spin-off of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete late in the third quarter this year. Our team is also making strong progress to develop and deliver multiple streams of earnings initiatives to achieve the $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings and accelerated growth by the end of 2023.  As we work to build a better IP, we remain laser-focused on delivering superior solutions to our customers, executing well and meeting our commitments to our shareowners and our other stakeholders. Turning now to Slide 4, which shows our first quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $730 million and free cash flow of $423 million despite the $80 million pretax earnings impact from the winter storm in the Southern U.S. Revenue increased by more than $100 million sequentially, primarily driven by price realization in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. And again, free cash flow is strong with a continued focus on running our businesses well, controlling our cost and actively managing our working capital.  Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our second quarter outlook. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Thank you, Mark, and good morning. I'll start with the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. First quarter operating earnings were $0.76. The winter storm impacted pretax earnings by $80 million or a $0.15 impact to operating EPS. We're still in the very early stages of the insurance process and do not have a recovery estimate at this time. Looking at the bridge, price/mix was strong driven by prior period price flow-through and packaging and cellulose fibers. Volume was essentially flat with continued strong demand for corrugated packaging and absorbent pulp. Overall papers volume continues to recover even though we saw the expected seasonal decline for papers in Brazil in the first quarter.  Operations and costs were favorable. Mill and box system performance was solid and helped mitigate the impact of the winter storm, which was a cost headwind of $55 million to operations. Maintenance costs increased sequentially, and we expect to complete about 65% of our maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Input costs were unfavorable, which included a $20 million cost impact from the storm, mostly for energy and raw materials such as starch and adhesives. Overall, we're seeing higher costs for recovered fiber, energy, chemicals and distribution, which we expect to continue in the second quarter.  Transportation conditions are challenging, and we're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion. Higher corporate expenses were driven by a noncash foreign exchange loss on intercompany loans, and lower equity earnings are partly attributed to the reduced ownership position in GPK. Turning to the segments, and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong demand across all of our channels, including box, sheets and containerboard. For the quarter, volume was essentially flat. We lost 145,000 tons of containerboard production due to the winter storm. Although our mills and box plants in the region recovered quickly, the storm did impact sales in the quarter. We had nearly 30 box plants in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi affected by the storm, which impacted our box shipments in the quarter.  Price and mix was strong. Our November increase is essentially implemented fully with the $131 million first quarter realization. And I would add, this is one of the fastest implementations that we've seen.  Operations and cost includes about $55 million impact from the winter storm, about half of which is due to unabsorbed fixed costs and the balance is related to repairs and higher distribution costs. Overall, mill and box plant performance was solid, and we leveraged our system to support strong customer demand across all of our channels.  Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially. We did defer about $30 million of maintenance outages from the first to the second quarter due to the significant production loss resulting from the winter storm. We expect to complete about 75% of our planned maintenance outages for packaging in the first half of the year.  Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, including about $20 million related to the winter storm due to higher energy, distribution and raw materials in our mill system and box plants. Higher recovered fiber costs were another significant headwind in the quarter. We expect continued cost pressure for recovered fiber, energy distribution in the second quarter, and we're still seeing the lingering effects in certain chemicals produced in Texas and Louisiana as suppliers recover from the winter storm.  Turning to Slide 7. As we enter the second quarter, we're seeing continued strong demand across all of our channels. U.S. and export containerboard demand is strong with low inventories in all regions. Our first quarter shipments were impacted by the significant production loss resulting from the storm. We're working with our customers to recover from extensive backlogs.  In our U.S. box system demand remains robust as more states start lifting restrictions. E-commerce, again grew at a strong double-digit pace in the first quarter, and we believe the majority of the accelerated consumer adoption in this channel is permanent.  With states starting to reopen, we're also seeing improved demand in segments with greater exposure to restaurant and foodservice channels, such as produce and protein, although we're still not back to pre-COVID levels.  Nondurables, excluding food and beverage, represents about 30% of U.S. box demand across a wide range of consumer and industrial products. This segment is benefiting from strong consumer demand in the broad manufacturing sector recovery. And lastly, demand for durable goods, which had the immediate pullback due to COVID is benefiting from a healthy housing market.  We're well positioned and have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a meaningful way, and our packaging team continues to focus on delivering superior packaging solutions to help our customers succeed.  Turning to Slide 8. I'll provide an update on the progress we're making in our EMEA packaging business. Our objective is to bring this business back to sustainable mid-teen margins and generate returns above our cost of capital. We're well on our way to achieving our goal.  In the first quarter, we improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $20 million compared with last year. The Madrid mill is fully ramped, and we have more integration and cost opportunities available. We're integrating our world-class lightweight recycled containerboard with our box network in Southern Europe to provide customers with a broader array of packaging solutions.  We've improved our footprint in the Iberian Peninsula through selective acquisitions, including 2 box plants in Spain acquired at the end of the first quarter. These acquisitions provide additional integration opportunities with the Madrid mill. And more importantly, they enhance our commercial capabilities in the region.  We continue to make progress with our box system performance and have more opportunity ahead. All our plants have clear commercial and operational plans, and we're leveraging the skills and resources from across the company to deliver on our commitments.  The map on the slide shows our packaging footprint in Europe after the sale of our Turkey packaging business, which we expect to close in the second quarter. After the sale, the EMEA packaging business will have 2 recycled containerboard mills, 21 box plants and 2 sheet plants. And again, our commitment is to bring this business to sustainable returns above our cost of capital.  Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 9. Price and mix was favorable with price realization accelerating across all pulp segments in the first quarter. Volume was moderately lower due to the shipping delays related to port congestion. Demand for fluff is solid and we have healthy backlogs.  Operations and costs improved sequentially, driven by the nonrepeat of the $20 million write-off in the fourth quarter as well as solid operations and good cost management. These improvements were partially offset by about $10 million of higher seasonal energy consumption and an FX loss at our mill in Canada.  Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected, and input costs increased due to higher wood costs in the Mid-Atlantic region as well as higher energy costs. Demand improved as we entered the year and the end-use demand signals for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 10. Our business -- our papers business has demonstrated outstanding resilience throughout the past year. Our performance reflects the talent and commitment of our team, the scale and capabilities of our global footprint and the strength of our highly valued brands. We continue to see steady recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return to office and return-to-school activity.  I'd also add that we've seen significant improvement in supply-demand dynamics both within the U.S. and outside the U.S. Looking at our first quarter performance, price and mix was stable across the segment. Volume decreased sequentially due to the lower seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia as expected. It also meant that the export supply chains are stretched in most regions. Operations and costs improved on solid operations and good cost management, as well as a favorable FX in Brazil of about $10 million. Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by 40,000 tons sequentially across the system. Maintenance outages increased modestly, as expected, and input costs increased primarily due to higher wood and energy costs in North America.  Looking at Ilim on Slide 11. The joint venture delivered $49 million in equity earnings in the first quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 35%, driven by higher average pricing. Volume decreased sequentially, primarily due to fewer shipping days because of the Chinese New Year, as well as the impact of tight shipping capacity in China. Underlying demand remained strong as we enter the second quarter. And lastly, in April, we saved a $144 million dividend payment from Ilim, which is $44 million higher than the estimate we provided last quarter.  Now we can turn to the outlook on Slide 12, and starting with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $75 million on realization of our March 2021 price increase. Volume is expected to decrease by $10 million on lower seasonal demand in Spain and Morocco as the citrus season winds down. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million, with the full recovery of the winter storm impact partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals related to a stronger outlook.  Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $77 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $20 million due to higher OCC, energy, raw materials and distribution costs.  In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $100 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $10 million, and input costs are expected to be stable.  Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million due to the nonrepeat of foreign currency gain in Brazil during the first quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $22 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million. And under equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture.  Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the first quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have no significant near-term maturities. And in the first quarter, we reduced debt by $108 million. We also returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases, which represented about 2.6 million shares at an average price of $50.28.  We acquired 2 box plants in Spain at the end of the first quarter. You can expect M&A to continue to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in North America and Europe. And lastly, in the first quarter, we monetized about $400 million of our stake in Graphic Packaging. After that transaction, we now hold about 7.4% ownership in the partnership.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. Turning to Slide 14. As we enter the second quarter, I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic, and there is still significant uncertainty in the geographies and markets that we operate. Having said that, we see momentum building in our 3 businesses. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard in North America and Europe. We're also seeing solid demand for absorbent pulp with more favorable supply and demand dynamics as paper-grade pulp demand recovers. In Printing Papers, we're seeing a steady recovery in demand. And in areas where schools and offices have reopened, we're seeing a step change improvement. Overall, we're seeing a much better supply/demand backdrop.  We expect price flow-through from prior price increases across our 3 businesses. We expect margins to improve, even as we manage through the impact of higher input costs for recovered fiber, energy and transportation. In addition, we expect productivity and other cost initiatives to offset general inflation. All of this contributes to a more favorable outlook for 2021.  And I'll end our prepared remarks on Slide 15. I just want to take a moment to reflect on what has now been a full year of living and working in a global pandemic environment. When we shared our first quarter performance last year, we talked about all the protocols we quickly put in place to keep our employees and contractors safe so that we could continue taking care of our customers. We stayed diligent about adhering to those protocols, and we will remain steadfast for as long as it takes to get fully and safely past the pandemic. We continue to operate in this environment with a view towards the short-term and long-term success and sustainability of International Paper for all of our stakeholders, with an unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contractors, to understanding and taking care of our customers' needs as they also adapt to rapid change, to supporting the critical needs in our communities and to building a better IP for all of our stakeholders.  Since the pandemic began, not a day goes by that I don't think about the commitment of our employees, and especially our frontline teams for their ability to adapt well and perform at a high level across circumstances and geographies. And once again, I want to take this time to thank each of our employees for their role in making our company strong and resilient.  And with that, Tim and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Mark, I'm just curious, it does seem like the containerboard business really has accelerated globally, not just containerboard, but corrugated. And that the market is quite tight. And I'm just curious about how that might be impacting your thinking about a potential conversion of that second line down at Selma? Mark Sutton : That's a good question, Mark. We obviously have looked at that and what product we might need in the future. If you just play out the current conditions, you'd probably look at using some of that from a packaging standpoint sooner.  But outside of interruptions like we talked about with the winter storm and one-offs, we have largely the containerboard we need when you look at all of our channels, domestic and our own box, domestic open market and export for what we believe is the foreseeable future. But that's a good option for us in the future. And it depends on the type of grades, whether it's medium or linerboard that we need. One is quicker and less expensive than the other. But it's on our radar screen. We don't feel the need to immediately do that right now. When we operate well and we don't have interruptions like we had in the first quarter, we feel quite confident in our containerboard quality, type of grade and overall capacity. Mark Wilde : Okay. And just as a follow-on, if I could, Mark. I know that both European producers and North American producers have been sort of pulling out of the export market and kind of rechanneling volume to their domestic businesses and domestic customers. I just -- I'm curious about how you think about this in the context of taking care of long-term export customers because I think there's some real concern by converters in places like Latin America that have always relied on imported board. Mark Sutton : Yes. It's definitely important to us. IP is probably the largest provider of kraftliner board in Latin America and Europe for long-term customers who use it because it's needed. And that's critically important to us, and we've talked about the importance of our channels to market, especially for kraftliner.  Things are very tight right now. Disruptions make that further -- more difficult for the supply chain. I think where we are right now is inventories are very low through the system with our customers and our own processes. And we are working individually with each of our customers, I can't speak for others, obviously, to make sure we can provide as much of their needs as possible in the time that they need it. But I think we're looking at a tight supply chain, especially for kraftliner for the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Hope you're doing well. I guess my first question is really around corrugated volume. And Mark, you mentioned that from what you're seeing and the acceleration from e-commerce, that you think the -- and I'm paraphrasing, the new consumption levels and new usage of corrugated, they're more or less here to stay. You don't intend or don't expect that to recede. So can you tell us why -- what evidence you're seeing that suggests that and how your volumes have looked to the extent that you can comment early in the second quarter? Mark Sutton : So it's a great question, George. I think one of the things we look at is what our customers look at. And on the e-commerce part of your question, we're seeing really important winning customers, investing more in their capability, putting real dollars and real equipment and real capability and hiring employees. Their data analytics around customer repeat buying and all that gives them confidence to believe that a good portion of this shift to an e-commerce way of retail is permanent. It may not be 100% permanent, but it is the majority of it. So we look for clues from our customers instead of trying to wish it or guess at it.  What's uncertain is as things return to a more \"normal environment\", what does traditional retail do? Is it a net loss to e-commerce? Or is it a hybrid? Were there still going to be some normal return to in-store brick-and-mortar type retail, and you can look at a lot of information, studies and listen to company's earnings reports that are in those businesses, and it's hard to conclude from that. So our box volumes in April for our own make box -- the boxes we make, looks -- the trends look like they're continuing from the first quarter. But I'll remind you, we serve multiple channels. So we're in the box market, whether we make the box, whether we have a long-term strategic partner using our containerboard and making specialty boxes or whether it's a pure open market, and we're seeing those volumes up close to double digit for the overall exposure we have for the North American box market.  So it looks like more of the same. We do see some channel shifting, which is good news. We see obviously some foodservice and restaurant supply picking up. Where that shows up for IP, and we're overweight in this area is fresh food produce, the type of things restaurants buy twice weekly, 3x weekly basis, which really got hit hard in the pandemic. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing in the demand trends and the segment exposure that we have. George Staphos : Just a point of clarification. The close to double-digit reference that you just made, what was that referring to? Mark Sutton : It's all in channels to market that we look to provide to the U.S. box market. So our vertical channel in our own box business, we have some strategic partnerships where we have either partial ownership or majority ownership downstream in the converting. And usually, that's specialty type products. And then we have just the pure open market where we have long-term arrangements.  When we look at the activity and -- that we participate in the U.S. box market, it's really strong. George Staphos : Okay. My other question, recognizing this was a very different first quarter from a storm and outage standpoint. And clearly, we can understand why you saw such a pickup in energy costs in the quarter. Looking back over time, it looks like IP's consumption of energy has been relatively constant. Are there -- given what we've seen in the last quarter and given that experience, what are the areas that you see where perhaps IP can become even more efficient within its mill network in terms of energy consumption? Mark Sutton : It's a good question. On energy, the main thing we can do on the mill system side is maximize our own make energy in our fully integrated kraftliner mills, where we make anywhere from 75% to 85% of our energy with carbon-neutral biomass. There's more we can do there. Sometimes it takes investment. As you know, what we've done with our capital investment program over the last couple of years is to navigate some strategic projects like Riverdale and then the pandemic and managing our entire liquidity situation. We -- those are the type of projects that you can go back and get later. Sometimes, it's unfortunate, but we delay them even though they have really good returns. So we've got more investment we can make.  Fuel switching, we've done a lot of to natural gas from other higher-cost fuels. And in the converting plants, we don't make our own energy. So part of it's geographical exposure to the grid, but part of it's energy efficiency through the uses of energy in the plant. Most all of that, where we are now in our company in terms of consumption, most all of that is part of our investment profile. And usually, George, those projects have the highest returns. And we plan to invest -- increase our investments in those areas now that all phases of our financial condition are much stronger. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : First question was you really did have a lot more pricing in the Industrial Packaging business flow-through than I think your original guidance had been. And you mentioned, Tim, that this was one of the fastest pass-throughs or your ability to get price turned out to be very good. Can you give us more color on what happened and what it tells you? Mark Sutton : It's a difficult question, Mark, because there's so many customers and so many unique commercial agreements. I think the general answer is when you have this type of demand, and a lot of our customers are dealing with multiple supply chain challenges. It's not just the packaging that they get but the other inputs. I think the discussion time about the gray area in every commercial relationship about how fast or how slow, no one loves price increases, obviously. That dynamic just lends itself, so let's get this done and get our material in and get it in as quickly as possible because I've got 17 problems and the box is only one of them. That's just a general answer.  The dynamic out there right now is things are very tight in multiple parts of the supply chain for a lot of our customers. And everything at the final minute of when you implement tends to be a human team in negotiation and it just went faster. Mark Weintraub : Great. And can you give us a sense -- I recognize that certainly by the end of the quarter, it was all in. Is there still some carryover impact that's included in that $75 million that you're looking for in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Or is that actually genuinely all from the new initiatives? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. It's small, Mark. There's probably just a little bit from the first price increase, but virtually all of it's in. And so we're looking forward now to the March increase implementation. Mark Weintraub : And one last one, sort of in the same vein, but in the pulp business, where great to see that, hopefully, second quarter will actually be a little bit in the black. I imagine though, because of the way those contracts are laid out, that even based on the prices -- price increases you've already implemented that there should presumably be more to come in the second half of the year. A, is that valid? And b, do you have pretty -- do you begin to have pretty good visibility on that? Or is that going to be negotiations and conversations yet to come? Mark Sutton : It's for the -- we gave an outlook. I think the number was $100 million in price in the second quarter. That's as far as we're going to go on that. But we like -- as I said in my closing prepared remarks, we really like the momentum in Cellulose Fibers right now. A big part of that like is the movement in pricing. But I don't want to go out into the third -- or into the third quarter and fourth quarter. But if you just take the confidence we have in the trajectory, I think you can make some conclusions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Okay. Well, Tim, one question on the guide -- the 2021 momentum building slide. I asked the same basic question on the last call, but -- so everything seems to be getting better as you go through the year. Why not resume providing guidance at this point? I know about all the -- there are many uncertainties, as there always are. So did you -- how much consideration did you get to doing that? And why did you reach the conclusion, at least for now that you don't want to resume doing so? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. It's a good question, Adam. I mean, technically, we don't provide guidance as such. We give an outlook. It's true that in prior periods, we had talked about a full year outlook and expectations sometimes within a range.  It's something that we look at every quarter. I think we're -- some of the uncertainty around COVID is -- seems to be diminishing. But I think maybe as we get to the middle of the year, we'll have a better feel for vaccination rates and what's reopening and what's not. And so it was just not enough in our view at this point in time to start talking about full year guidance. But we do have a lot of optimism about how we see the year playing out. Mark Sutton : Adam, this is Mark. Just to add. It's -- look, it's a good question. We have given the investment community, as Tim said, at least an EBITDA range, a couple of other numbers for full year expectations. I think what's missing is that EBITDA number. We did talk about our capital expenditures, for example. But as we get into this year, a full year guidance given in the middle of the year, I think was maybe less valuable than if we would have given at the beginning of the year.  Look, I'm an optimistic person. You know me personally, Adam, I am feeling really good about where we are. But just as soon as I say that, I think about our employees in Poland right now or our employees in Brazil, and they are where we were during the Christmas holidays and in January with pandemic and its effect on their economy and their lives. So I just don't want to get out over our skis and say things that imply this is all behind us only to have to come back and say, what, that was too quick. So I know it's a little frustrating, but we're trying to get this transparent outlook, as Tim walked through methodically all those numbers on the outlook slide. And hopefully, that gives people a sense of the big picture, which is things are really strong and improving.  And we have, as Tim said, on the capital allocation slide, a balance sheet that's headed very quickly to the low end of our range and good cash generation, flowing cash through the capital allocation framework, dividend share repurchases like we committed to, albeit interrupted for a program not casually. And so that's the message I really want investors to take away and analysts to work with.  But your point is well taken. It's information you used to have, but you don't have right now. Adam Josephson : No, I really appreciate that, Mark. And just one other question for you on -- back to the e-commerce and the whole box demand issue. You used to talk about the relationship between box demand and GDP, and between box demand and nondurable industrial production. And you have that really good slide in your roadshow handout to that effect. How do you think those relationships have changed, if at all, given this new information you have about the presumed permanence of this e-commerce growth. Mark Sutton : Well, that's a really good question. I know our team is looking at the resiliency of that model that creates that slide you're talking about in our roadshow where we have the nondurable and transportation index and a number of other metrics.  I don't know if we've decided that there's a shift in it yet, but I know our team is looking at it. As soon as we have something that we feel good about and that it's legitimate and statistically valid, we like to share that in our investor material, and we'll do that in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Philip Ng : Appreciating there's a greater lag in the flow-through on pricing. But with fluff pulp prices approaching 2018 levels, and commercial initiatives you guys are implementing, how quickly do you think that earnings power for cellulose to kind of return back to 2018 levels? Mark Sutton : Well, we gave the outlook for the second quarter, and you can look at the trend there on just the pricing comment of $100 million. I think we are in that part of the pulp market dynamic. And we're also trying, as I mentioned multiple times, we're trying to change the business model commercially, primarily on how we go to market and how we interact with our customers so that we put more sustainability and less volatility in the business. And that's a lot of work, about work I can comment on because it's customer-specific, but we feel good about where we are right now. And we think the business can get back to. And then, if we can invest in the cost side, improve upon what numbers you're talking about from '18. Philip Ng : That's great. I appreciate that color. It seems like a solid game plan. The 145,000 lost tons in containerboard from the winter storms, is your view you would essentially sell pretty much all that? Or would that have been kind of an effort behind to build inventory? The reason I'm asking, I'm just trying to gauge if you view that as pent-up demand for 2Q. And then more broadly, just given how tight things are, do you have bandwidth to kind of supply your customers given how strong demand is right now? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. We're working hand in glove with customers across all of our channels, trying to make sure that we're meeting their needs as quickly as possible.  Having said that, it's a challenge. 145,000 tons, a big portion of that was available for sale and ready to go. In some cases, as we go into the second quarter, it's a heavier maintenance outage quarter. And so part of it is preparing for that as well. But definitely missed opportunities on the containerboard side. But as, if not more importantly on the box side, with 30 plants down and significant exposure. So our estimates around that exposure is that the growth that we had in the quarter would be closer to overall industry growth if we haven't had that disruption. Philip Ng : But you see that demand still there? Or your customers kind of went elsewhere to kind of get supply just given how tight things are? Timothy Nicholls : Well, some of it's there. Some of them are still working through, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, working through backlogs. All of these channels have different lead times on orders and when customers are expecting them. And so we're working through it customer by customer on that basis. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Connelly of Stephens. Mark Connelly : Following on Phil's question. If we remove the storm impact that held back first quarter, is there any reason to think that IP can't match the industry shipments in 2021 or even exceed it? I'm thinking about the outages and the maintenance timing shifts and that sort of stuff. Because obviously, there was a lag or a lag in performance in 4Q too. So I just want to make sure we're not missing anything. Mark Sutton : No, it's a good question, Mark. There's no reason to believe we can't match or exceed. Now given our size exceeds means some basis points, not multiples. But there's no reason you can't match the market. Fourth quarter, we did have some operational issues, if you recall. And then not an excuse, but this geography and the winter storm matched right on top of us. But no reason you shouldn't expect us to perform at or better than the market. Mark Connelly : Okay. And that's helpful. Just on EMEA, following on Tim's comments, how does the push to mid-teens margins in EMEA breakout between converting and mill opportunities? I'm just wondering if there's spending opportunities at those mills or if most of the incremental investment and improvement is coming on the converting side. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. It's a good question, Mark. We think we have additional opportunities, not that so many of them require capital in the mill operations, but just in terms of how we're managing cost as we get fully up the ramp curve and integrated, and it's both mill and supply chain. So we see more opportunity for the mill in Spain. The other mill is a more mature mill that's been there for a while. And so it's probably running at an optimal level. But in Spain, given the integration play, we see more opportunity. Mark Connelly : So bringing some of the strengths in the integration that you have in the U.S. over to there. Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleve Rueckert of UBS. Cleveland Rueckert : Just first off, I wanted to follow up on the $350 million to $400 million of incremental EBITDA. I think $300 million of that was supposed to be from cost savings. And I realized Q1 was kind of challenging, but I didn't hear an update on how much of that you've achieved to date or how much you expect to achieve this year headed towards that 2023 exit rate? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Well, you -- we didn't provide one. So we're working through our plans right now, and we're in the process of beginning the implementation of all that. We pointed on the last quarterly call to some of the benefits that we saw coming through, more of the process automation and using data analytics and technology. And as we go through this year, we're looking forward to probably the third quarter where we provide a robust update in terms of all of the plans that are being executed and achievement this year, but also run rate expectations for 2022. Cleveland Rueckert : Okay. All right. That's clear. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on the containerboard and corrugated box business. Could you give us just a sense of where your inventories stand, given the disruptions kind of, I guess, where you are today at an inventory level versus where you like to be or where you've been historically on average? And kind of what the trajectory is there on the inventory side given the outages in the second quarter? Mark Sutton : Well, the easy answer is we're lower than we'd like to be. And that's the source of the hand to glove comment Tim just made. So we need to rebuild, while we serve our customers' active demand, we need to be very efficient in rebuilding important roll stock inventories across the wide range of boxes that we have to make. So there's more for us to do. It's not unexpected when you have this type of demand, coupled with the one-off interruption of the storm we talked about and then just the timing of outage schedules.  But the good news is we have a really big system, and it's very flexible and it recovers very quickly. So we feel like we could do it. But our inventories are lower than we would like, all things considered. And the main thing I'm concerned with right now is our ability to support our customers through their dynamic demand changes. And that's what our focus is right now. Cleveland Rueckert : That's clear. I guess just quickly, given what you know about the second quarter, would you expect to be in a position to build inventories? Timothy Nicholls : Every effort is going to be made to try to restore inventory levels, but it's a heavy maintenance outage quarter. And so you're triaging and prioritizing and trying to satisfy all of the needs across the channels. So now the good news is, most of the outages are behind us by the time we get to the middle of the year. But these supply chains are very long, and they take a long time to recover. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : I'm thinking about integration levels in the corrugated operations or Industrial Packaging North America and kind of whether or not you kind of still view this as the right destination? I mean, you have some competitors that are maybe trying to bump that up for different reasons. And I also appreciate that maybe looking back in the rearview mirror, you're kind of playing a little bit more defense and/or kind of making some asset changes along the way. Now you've got some kind of more, I'll call it, disposable cash to go on offense with and you made these 2 small box plant acquisitions. Is that part of the strategy that maybe get that closer to something, I don't know, 90%? Or you feel good at that 80% level kind of over a longer-term basis? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. So we think what's important about integration is how we go about building it. Our most profitable channel is our North American domestically integrated channel containerboard to box and to the customer. And we want to grow that part of the business by delivering superior solutions on the packaging side to our customers. So that we're building long-term sustainable relationships where we can through small M&A or some of these more creative arrangements that we've started implementing to grow that channel. So higher over time, but done in a very sustainable way. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then, I guess, kind of to revisit the cost reduction or the $300 million to $350 million of savings and trying to marry up the comments that you made about Europe. Are those sort of mutual exclusive, meaning the $20 million or so that you saw an improvement in profitability this quarter and I think what you talked about kind of getting back to mid-teens implies maybe another $100 million of improvement in aggregate for European Industrial Packaging. Is that more related to the mill conversion over there and that starting to contribute? Or is that, again, kind of included in that $300 million to $350 million of savings? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Part of it is included, but it's across commercial, operational supply chain. It's all the things that we touch in terms of delivering a packaging solution to a customer. So we've got improvement plans across all aspects of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn of RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Just had a question on Global Cellulose Fibers. Just when I look at the quarter, I mean, it's an improvement, but it's still a disappointing result, especially when I compare it to your European peers. Where do you see this business being mid-cycle? Can you get up to the profitability of your peers? And when you -- how long do you think that's going to take? Mark Sutton : Well, as I mentioned on the last call, we -- last quarter call, Paul, we see the business improving quarter after quarter after quarter. And we think it'll be in very good shape. I don't have all those European numbers in my head -- off the top of my head, but we think it'll be in very good shape as we leave '21 and head into '22. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar of Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : For corrugated, can you just talk about the cadence of volume growth through the first quarter by month? And then, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of box shipments so far in April? Timothy Nicholls : April is running very close to maybe a little bit ahead of how we exited the quarter, just looking -- it was pretty steady throughout the quarter -- yes. I mean, it started really strong in January. Now we think a big part of that is our exposure to e-commerce because you not only have the Christmas push around the holidays, but January with returns and in specialty sales and whatnot. It tends to be a strong month as well. But I think it was solid throughout the quarter. Neel Kumar : Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of your recent asset sales, I was wondering if you can just touch on how you're thinking about allocating proceeds between buybacks versus inorganic and organic investments? And then more generally, where are you in the process of evaluating your portfolio of assets. Could there be additional asset sale announcements? Or is it generally complete at this point? Timothy Nicholls : Well, when we talked about on the acquisition side is look at what we've been doing for the past couple of years. They've tended to be one-off operations, sometimes two, bolt-on in nature and filling gaps in capability or exposure that we want. And most of them, to be honest, that's happened in Europe at this point.  In terms of the cash coming in, we have a fairly robust capital allocation framework that we have talked about over time, including the strong balance sheet, target ranges of debt. The fact that we're on a path of share repurchases before COVID hit and out of prudence we took a pause last year, but we're back in the market. But the goal is to be thoughtful about the cash coming in and making sure that we're doing everything in our power to maximize value through the actions that we take. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : On Global Cellulose Fibers, I just want to talk about the port congestion that you're experiencing and maybe how that is impacting your volumes or your supply chain in that business? Mark Sutton : It's a good question, Kyle. It's a big issue. We're not losing orders because of it because we're spec-ed in, in a lot of the customers. It's just creating a long, long supply chain. So customers are trying to figure out the new duration between placing an order and actually receiving it and in some cases, trying to get our help to understand whether they should change their order cycle. So there's a lot of order management changes being talked about and figured out between IP as the supplier and our customers. But it affects more than our pulp business. It affects our export containerboard, and we're even seeing it in our export paper business in Brazil. I don't think there's an immediate fix to it. So it's a velocity mission on the supply chain than it looks like, we're going to have to adapt to for some period of time. Kyle White : Got it. That's helpful. And then switching to EMEA Industrial Packaging. Can you guys provide some of your integration rate for just that region and kind of where do you see it going with these recent acquisitions in Spain? And then maybe just a longer-term target for integration there as you continue kind of bolt-ons in that region? Mark Sutton : We typically don't give a number because it's not as clean. We're integrated on our kraftliner from our U.S. mill system to our European box plants. We have world-class mill. We just started up a couple of years ago in Madrid. That's almost at its full ramp, which is a lot of our high-performance lightweight liner. But we buy most of our medium -- the corrugated medium from the open market. So we typically haven't given an absolute number.  But as Tim said, building an integrated model regionally is where we have the most success commercially and on the financial metrics. And so that's kind of the approach we're taking in Europe is regional density. And so right now, it's Iberian Peninsula surrounding our new mill and supported with kraftliner from our U.S. system. And then we have some very important suppliers in the European market for grades that we don't make or just that make geographic sense because of grade. So we're still a large customer for some key European containerboard producers and those are long-term relationships.  So I appreciate everyone's questions. Again, thank you for your interest in International Paper, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President-Investor Relations. Guillermo, you may begin. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Shelly. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is also available on our website. Our website contains copies of our second quarter 2021 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim joint venture, Slide 2 provides context around the joint venture\u2019s financial information and statistical measures. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo. Good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper delivered solid earnings growth and strong cash generation in the second quarter. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for fluff pulp. And in our paper's business, demand recovery accelerated in the second quarter across our key geographies. We grew revenue by 15% as compared to the second quarter of last year, with price realization accelerating in all of our business segments. Our mill and converting system performed well. However, we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory across our packaging network, due to two facts : the lingering effects of the winter storm in the first quarter and then our planned maintenance outages in the second quarter. These operating conditions severely stressed along with severely stressed transportation environments, adversely affected volume and operating costs in the second quarter. Input costs and freight were significant headwind in just about every category. I would call out the sharp rise in recovered fiber costs in North America and Europe. Although, it certainly had a significant cost impact and it is another indication of the strong demand environment. Our Ilim joint venture delivered outstanding performance with equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter and a strong outlook as we move into the third quarter. On capital allocation, we're making significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million. We also returned $258 million to our shareowners, including $57 million of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging. I'm really pleased with the return on our investment. We structured the transaction in 2018, maximized the value of the Consumer Packaging business for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we're making excellent progress on the spin-off of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete on October 1. Across IP, the team is doing an outstanding job managing complexity. We remain diligent in applying COVID-19 layers of protection for our employees and contractors. And I really appreciate our team's commitment to execute well, take care of each other and take care of our customers as we work together to build a better IP for our shareholders and really all of our stakeholders. I'm going to turn to Slide 4 now, which shows our second quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $793 million and free cash flow of $633 million, which brings our free cash flow generation to more than $1 billion for the first half of 2021. Revenue increased by $750 million or 15% as compared to last year, driven by higher average prices in our three businesses, as well as volume growth in our Packaging and Paper's businesses. Margins improved sequentially with price realization outpacing higher input and transportation costs. We expect margins to expand meaningfully in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces rising input and transportation costs, and importantly, as we stepped down from our highest maintenance quarter of a year. Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5, second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.06 as compared to $0.76 in the first quarter. Price and max improved by nearly $0.50 per share sequentially, driven by very strong price realizations across all of our business segments. Volume was essentially flat versus last quarter, demand for corrugated packaging is very strong and demand for fluff pulp is solid, while demand for papers continues to recover in all key regions. Second quarter volume and our North American packaging business was constrained by severely low containerboard inventory and fluff pulp shipments were hampered by significant port congestion. Our mills and converting system performing well. Operating costs were adverssely impacted by a highly stressed supply chain environment for both inbound materials to help down shipments as well as the exceptionally low containerboard inventory conditions and our North America packaging system. Maintenance outage costs increased by 18% sequentially as we completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. On absolute level, maintenance costs were $250 million in the second quarter. Input costs were a significant headwind for most materials and energy costs remain elevated, providing little relief following the winter storm. OCC represented about half of the sequential increase in input costs.  Although some of the pressure in input costs could be transitory such as the impact of heavy rainfall on our wood cost in the Gulf region. The extremely tight transportation environment will continue to put pressure on all inbound materials. Every mode of transportation is tight and we expect them to remain tight as we move to the second half of year. Corporate expenses benefited from favorable reserve adjustments. Our tax rate of 24% in the second quarter was sequentially lower, primarily due to a discrete period tax benefit, and equity earnings improved substantially on very strong performance from Ilim. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6, we continue to see strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets, and containerboard. As Mark indicated, we operated with extremely low container-board inventory in the U.S. system. These conditions impacted volume and operating costs in the quarter. We are working to replenish inventories following the winter storm and maintenance outages as we manage through a tight transportation environment. Taking a look at our second quarter performance, volume was sequentially flat. Strong demand in our North American box and containerboard channels, offset lower seasonal demand in our EMEA business. Volume across our U.S. chnnels grew by 10% as compared to last year, which includes our U.S. box system, open market containerboard customers, as well as our recent equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders. Price and mix increased by about $110 million in the quarter. We're making excellent progress on the realization of our margin increase. Our mills and converting systems performed well. However, operating costs were impacted by severely low containerboard inventories and stress transportation environment with congestion across all modes. Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially as we completed the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. In our Industrial Packaging business, we've completed about 75% of our planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, primarily driven by higher costs for OCC, chemicals and distribution. About $10 million of the sequential increase in input cost occurred in our EMEA packaging business, primarily for OCC and energy. Taking a closer look at OCC, we consume about 5 million tons annually across our U.S. mill system and Spain. We see the rise in OCC cost as a reflection of the underlying strength and global demand for corrugated packaging. We expect OCC costs to rise further in the third quarter, even as seasonal generation improves. We expect continued U.S. and export demand, especially from India and Southeast Asia, which were largely offsetting pre-restriction OCC exports to China. Turning to Slide 7. We're well positioned for strong earnings growth and margin expansion in our packaging business in the third and fourth quarter. Demand is strong across all our channels. We expect continued robust volume growth across our U.S. channels and we're making excellent progress on the price realization of our margin increase. Our containerboard inventories will enable operational and supply chain efficiencies, as we move through the second half of the year. We do expect further transportation in the third quarter with substantial pressure on OCC and transportation cost. Our teams are doing an admirable job managing costs in tough environment. We expect further opportunities to be more efficient as inventories are little while. In addition, our commercial initiatives are outpacing cost, pressure and positions for strong margin expansion in second half of the year. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. Demand from fluff pulp is solid and the end-user demand signal for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. Looking at our sequential earnings price and mix improved by $104 million in the second quarter with price realization accelerating across all regions and segments as expected. Volume was moderately lower due to significant U.S. port congestion and frequent vessel schedule changes which delayed our shipments. Mill performance was strong, however, operating costs were impacted by the type of supply chain environment, we expect these conditions to continue in the third quarter. Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected and input costs were moderately higher with lower lead cost in the Mid-Atlantic region offset by higher chemical and energy cost. Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 9. Our papers business delivered earnings of $76 million in the second quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our Printing Papers business carries strong momentum as we approached the spinoff on October 1. And then it continues to recover in all of our key regions, additionally, our volume recovery is outpacing the industry through the strength of our global brands and commercial excellence. Looking at the second quarter performance, price and mix improved by nearly $30 million with price realization across all regions. Fixed absorption improved with lower economic downtime in our North American mill system. However operating costs were impacted by the tight transportation department. We executed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year as well. And on input costs, we experienced pressure on wood, chemicals and freight. As I said earlier, we're on track to spinoff the papers business on October 1, separation planning is progressing well and we expect to file the Form-10 with details of the spinoff in the first half of August. As you would expect, there is significant flexibility. Our teams are doing an outstanding job managing the business as we prepare for a successful separation. Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter with an EBITDA margin of 47% driven by strong price realization for pulp and containerboard. Volume improved sequentially on strong demands for pulp and containerboard, as well as more shipping days in the second quarter, following the impact of the Chinese New Year in the prior quarter. Underlying demand that stable following inventory restricting during the first half of 2021, shipping capacity is tight and supply chains to China are stretched. Third quarter volume is expected to decrease moderately as Ilim executes the majority of its annual maintenance program. So now we'll turn to the outlook for the third quarter on Slide 12. As Mark said earlier, we expect meaningful earnings and margin expansion as we move to the third quarter. Looking at industrial packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $110 million on the continued realization of our March, 2021 price increase. Volume in North America is expected to improve by $10 million, while volume in Europe is expected to decrease by $10 million. Operating costs are expected to improve by $5 million with the North American system benefiting from a gradual recovery and containerboard inventory levels. Staying with industrial packaging, maintenance outages expenses are expected to be down by $122 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $85 million with OCC representing about 60% of the expected increase. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $60 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $5 million on continued supply chain stress due to port congestion. Maintenance outages expense is expected to decrease by $15 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 billion on higher wood and chemical costs. In printing papers, we expect pricing and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to be unchanged. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $23 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million, primarily due to higher wood cost. And under the equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint ventures. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, we're comfortable taking it on leverage below the target range of 2.5 times to 2.8 times debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the first quarter we \u2013 in the second quarter we reduced debt by $796 million, bringing our debt reduction to $904 million in the first half of 2021. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second quarter we returned $258 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sharing repurchases were $57 million, which represented 1 million shares at an average price of $60.80. We have about $1.5 billion available under the company's share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter. Lastly, in the second quarter we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging for about $400 million, this brings our total cash proceeds on the investment to $1.3 billion before expected cash taxes of about $300 million in the second half of 2021. As a reminder, we also have a tax receivable agreement with Graphic Packaging under which we expect to receive about $100 million in cash proceeds during the second half of 2021. With that, I'll turn it back over Mark. Mark Sutton : Tim, thank you very much for all the detail. As we look forward, we're positioned for strong earnings and margin expansion in the second half of 2021. My confidence in making a statement saves on the following. Our commercial initiatives are driving revenue growth and our building converting systems will regain meaningful operational and supply chain efficiencies, as we replenish inventories. Although raising input cost will likely linger, uncertain we can successfully navigate the environment, given the strong demand backdrop. Our papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the October 1 spinoff. Our team is doing an outstanding job, managing the business and taking care of customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tireless efforts as we plan for a successful separation. As we moved through 2021, we had a significant operating and non-operating cash catalyst, and we are laser focused on the capital allocation framework that Tim just described. All of our cash will flow through our framework with one objective, maximizing value creation for our shareholders. I'm excited about the actions we're taking to build a better IP or accelerating earnings growth and building a foundation for long-term success. We're looking forward to sharing more about that with you in the months ahead. With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question, Mark, you and Tim have talked about this in the past about running the cash flow generation that the company has both from an operating standpoint and non-operating, since you have so many transactions that have been occurring this year and will continue to occur this year through your framework. What should we take away from that in terms of what tools that you have in your quiver may be more applicable now versus what might have been the case three and six months ago? And Tim, what gives you comfort and why you think it's appropriate in your view for leverage to drop below your target range? What are the things that you think make that prudent strategy, if you can give us a couple of thoughts there? And then I had a follow-on. Tim Nicholls : Sure. Good morning, George. George Staphos : Good morning, Tim. Tim Nicholls : The way we're thinking about it is, we are trying to maximize value. We have a lot of cash coming in, in a moment. We do \u2013 everything looks positive as we go forward, but we recognize this as a cyclical business to some extent. And so, the relation to the balance sheet where we are trying to build strength, reduce risk and also the flexibility and optionality. And so taking it down below the target range, which is really a target range through a cycle, sometimes we'll be below and sometimes will not be a little bit above. But we just view it, that coupled with our attention performances, derisking the company share repurchases and dividend is very important. And so that is over time as we not necessarily quarter-by-quarter, but over year-by-year. We look to be returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders, and then everything else gets tested, whether it's organic or small bolt-on types of acquisitions, it gets tested against that. George Staphos : As a follow-on, would the accelerating performance that you are seeing into the second half be any way guide or compass point for you in terms of how you may further allocate capital, especially, to value return over the rest of the year into 2022? Or is it really not so much because you look at this on a longer-term basis? And what are the whys and why not on that? And then my related question, I'll turn it over for everyone. Do you have any kind of view that you could share with how much cash Sylvamo will need to operate on an ongoing basis? Thank you very much. Tim Nicholls : Yes. Just on the last, we do. And that will be - the Form 10 is going to be coming out here in short order and I think that will answer all the questions. To your first part of your question, I think, we try to look at both. We try to look at circumstances in the moment, but we definitely have a long-term view and we're thinking about how to create value and what our value is over time. So I hope we try to take those into the calendar for time. Mark Sutton : Tim, if I could and George just wrap up that was a lot of ground covered in the capital allocation questions that you asked. And we do take a long-term view. And as I said last quarter, one of the things we're really excited about is that we've got IP position for the first time in really almost forever or definitely recent memory for our entire capital allocation levered set, strong balance sheet, ability to pay strong dividend, share repurchases at the right times, and very importantly, smart investments in our business, as Tim said, organic or inorganic. We have all of those levers available at the same time. And our past history, as all of you know, is we\u2019ve had two or three or maybe two out of four, sometimes only one out of four. And that's what we really are excited about as we're going forward. As we separate into two companies, the new IP is going to have a capital allocation posture that we haven't had in a long time. And that's very exciting for our shareholders. It's very exciting for the company, because we have options to grow the businesses that are growing to manage our return of cash, all generating, hopefully, outstanding shareholder return. George Staphos : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, Mark and Tim. Thanks for taking my question. I guess not to deliver the point here, but \u2013 and I appreciate that there is somewhat of a wall of worry out there. But I think one of your peers kind of talked about potentially, a structurally higher level of demand for corrugated for various reasons, whether it's e-commerce or potential onshoring and manufacturing activity. So I guess, ask the question a little bit differently. Your balance sheet and pension probably have not been in as good as shape for two to three decades. Is there something that you see around the corner that gives you pause in terms of any of your businesses and it sounds like again, pretty near \u2013 constructive near-term outlook? I'll stop there. Mark Sutton : No, Gabe. I think we also do the corrugated packaging market as potentially having a bit of a reset through this last year-and-a-half. We listened to our customers on that, which I'm not sure where it's 8% every quarter-over-quarter and quarter out like it was in the last quarter. But definitely, a step up from the low single-digit growth rates, and that's what we want to be positioned for. When we talk about growing at a minimum with the market, we mean over time and a reasonable assumption of growth on the U.S. market, and that's a number that I think is leaning towards the higher end, just because of a couple of things. The adoption of e-commerce through the pandemic, which has, I think proven to be very sticky and valuable proposition that fiber-based packaging represents to people in terms of its circularity, renewable natural resources, making energy in carbon-neutral biomass way, and a high recycling rate is finally with all the talk about sustainability and climate and a number of other issues finally getting attention all the way down to the consumer level. So we're very excited about the corrugated packaging outlook. And we want to make sure we're there with the right asset base, the right customer list, the right technical capabilities to grow \u2013 to sharing that growth. Gabe Hajde : All right. Thank you, Mark. And I guess switching gears, are you guys prepared at all, it's been call it eight months or so since you've announced the $350 million to $400 million of cost reduction to provide maybe a little bit more detail either, cadence of that of how we might expect it to flow through. I'm assuming maybe we've seen a little bit here in the first half, but \u2013 and then maybe by segment, what you expect to see or is that something you maybe prefer to wait to talk about? Mark Sutton : Yes, Gabe, we plan on starting that as we head towards the third quarter release and then for the end of the year to get an expectation about 2022 performance. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. On Industrial Packaging, the FPA and AF&PA data would suggest that sort of industry inventories are kind of closer back to a normal or more of a normally historic level for July. I'm just wondering if it's possible to quantify or put a finer point on how far below you are sort of normal or comfortable levels of inventory and sort of where that was exiting the quarter, and maybe as we're here at the end of July? Tim Nicholls : Yes. It's \u2013 I mean through the second quarter, we saw the lowest inventory levels in our system that we've probably ever experienced. Coming out of the second quarter into the July, we're able to start recovering a little bit of that, but look we're \u2013 I mean the winter storm impacted us hard 145,000 tons followed by that normally high outage quarter in the second quarter. So it's going to take a little bit of time for us to recover that as we go through third quarter and probably into the fourth quarter to some extent. So yes, we were at our lowest levels we've ever seen in the second quarter. Mark Sutton : Anthony, I think the other perspective on inventories and I've seen a lot written by analysts on normal inventories and one, just thing to remember the way we look at it. Normal inventories averages from the past, tend to correlate with more normal supply chain environment, so normal transportation, velocity, so forth and so on. And we are nowhere near any kind of normal supply chain performance by third-party partners in the transportation world. So our inventory view in IP for the next quarter and the quarter after that is also influenced and adjusted by what's happening in the transportation and supply chain networks. So I would expect that normal right now should be higher levels of inventory to perform the same with customers as we had when transportation velocity was much higher. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And the point well taken, and then just maybe following up on capital allocation. In terms of \u2013 you talked about the willingness to potentially go under the 2.5 times to 2.8 times range at what is, I think a pretty positive part of the cycle. As you look to the spin, would you look at revisiting that 2.5 times to 2.8 times target range either up or down? I mean, you're going to have a more durable, higher quality business with industrial packaging and pulp. At the same time you have a publicly traded competitor and containerboard that's been operating closer to one turn or certainly below two turns. So just wondering if you could talk about the range and maybe your willingness to revisit it over the long-term? Tim Nicholls : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Anthony. And certainly, we \u2013 none of this is static, right? So we wanted to be understood and we want to be consistent and true to the framework as we talk about it. But that doesn't bother us from reevaluating based on portfolio and other specifics potential changes that we think are beneficial to our investors and stakeholders, so nothing now, but something that we will turn over time. Mark Sutton : Anthony, I think the way you should probably think about how we make that decision together Tim and his team and me is, we try to look at the company and its optimal weighted average cost of capital, a portion of that is what credit rating we need to have that delivers and supports that. So you're absolutely right, we're going to be a different company going forward, that analysis is something that we do continuously, we\u2019re relied at the credit rating target we have based on the company, we will continue to look at that and try and make sure that our ROIC is constructed in the most effective way to get the best solid high quality return we can for shareholders and definitely debt ratios and credit ratings are part of that. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Wanted to first just get maybe more color on the targeted volumes, solid up 3.9% industry though was up 8.2%. You mentioned supply chain and other challenges you had. Did that actually suppressed where your volumes otherwise would have been, and if that was the case, is that business that when your system's operating easily comes back or can you kind of give us some color on how to understand the volume situation? Mark Sutton : Mark, I think the way to think about the \u2013 I was looking at what we had \u2013 what we sort of put in our outlook in the first quarter call. And we actually had stronger performance and we thought we were going to have, but we didn't know like a lot of people didn't know the market was going to grow 8%. We had the inability doing a quarter in some cases to pick up incremental business, we didn\u2019t lose any business, because our core customer lists that was coming into the quarter as business. There may be some business that we didn't bid, most of it is shorter-term business. So that the answer is, yes, we have people still call on us today. Can you supply me more boxes? In some cases we can, we just couldn't do it in the second quarter. So I'm not concerned about losing anything permanently. We basically had a classic mismatch between the available capacity in our system and the demand in a 90-day period. Mark Weintraub : And when you say the available capacity, is that because your capacity during these 90-days were constrained by unusual factors, or basically you're just pretty much running full to your system? Mark Sutton : Yes, the two factors I mentioned Mark in my opening comments, we have more than one quarter of recovery from the winter storm, 140,000 tons just evaporated from our containerboard supply chain. And on top of that, we had a highest maintenance quarter in ITT in the last 10 years. So if you just normalize what was above normal maintenance plus that winter storm, that's a chunk of containerboard capacity that could not be converted into a box. And that's coming back, it's just going to take a little while to get it back. So what we had available ran wide open, but we have the capacity offline for maintenance and we have the lingering effect of the 140,000 tons from the first quarter. None of those are permanent, all of those will be significantly improved as we navigate through the second half. Mark Weintraub : Got it. And then just on pulp, as the great price mix showing in the quarter and you pointed to another I think it was $60 million or so for the third quarter. Does that pretty much reflect all of the benefit from \u2013 the pricing that's already happened, forgetting about what happens from here or, or the way your contracts set up? Is there meaningful additional lag that might come through based on what's happened previously with posted prices? Mark Sutton : So that's a complicated question, because of the nature of some of these contracts by customer type by region. But let me just kind of state \u2013 restate what we talked about the last two quarters, that a, you could expect, quarter-by-over \u2013 quarter-over-quarter improvement in this business, steady improvement in this business, and we're seeing that. But our strategy is to have the kind of margins in this business that reflect the value that fluff pulp provides for the end use customers. So we're taking a very structured, very measured approach to each market segment and to the agreements we currently have in those segments with individual customers. And so, as we implement this approach, we would expect that there\u2019d be some volume shifts and movement between segments. And our goal is to have mix improvement, better agreements with better economics that reflect the value of fluff pulp. And that is a kind of customer-by-customer region of the world by region of the world and I would expect and we're making progress, good progress on that. But given the length of some of these agreements and the way they're structured, we should expect to continue to see margins improve over the next several quarters. So that's a long complicated answer to whether we have any more price flow through, it's not just about price flow through, it\u2019s about restructuring these commercial agreements and getting the proper value for this product. Mark Weintraub : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark; good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Good morning. Mark Wilde : I was wondered Mark or Kim, if you can just help us a little bit with kind of cadencing the pass-through of the spring containerboard hike. And then, I don't think you said anything about this perspective early August hike, so maybe if you could just give us some color around that as well, just as we think about the next couple of quarters and into 2022. Tim Nicholls : Yes. Hey Mark, it\u2019s Tim. So I think the increase from the fall as we talked about last quarter went through a record amount of time, it was the fastest size I've ever seen. The pace on the second one, we were kind of expecting a normal historical rent up on it, it seems to be going faster, not as fast as the first, but still faster than what we've seen over time. We'll see as August comes, we'll see how that will plunge out. But right now we see our fundamentals looking very strong, we\u2019ve seen strong demand and as Mark talks about, all of the complications from the supply chain are really stretching inventory tighter than they would normally be. So far this is the first two price increase implementations we feel really good. Mark Wilde : Well. So can you give us a sense Tim, of how much benefit from that spring hike you've had in the second quarter? And just order of magnitude what we might expect in the third and fourth quarters? Tim Nicholls : Yes, I think if you look at the two of them combined, we'd be about 80% complete on implantation at this point. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. And then any thoughts on sort of how August would roll in? Tim Nicholls : Yes, I don't know, I mean that's forward-looking and we feel very confident at the moment, but I don\u2019t want to speak to forecasting price at this point. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. That's fair. Mark, I just want to as a follow-up turn to the containerboard business from just a kind of a supply and demand standpoint. Does this continue to strengthen in global containerboard demand? Is it altered your thinking at all about investing in either the bottlenecking projects at the existing mills or potentially the timing on that second conversion at Riverdale? And are you also doing anything to kind of gear up capacity on the converting side as e-commerce continues to grow as a bigger and bigger percentage of the market? Mark Sutton : That\u2019s three question Mark. And the answer is, coming into maybe the middle of 2020, we were saying, and I was saying, we feel really good about our containerboard capacity, we have what we need, the amount, the type of grades. When everything is running, we have enough capacity. But everything isn\u2019t running every day, colleges and of course events that you don't predict like that winter storm issue. But yes, we are looking continuously at debottleneck and we've done a bunch of that in the last several years painfully, because we need that containerboard now. We are looking at different options for adding containerboard into our system, if it looks like this kind of demand level it\u2019s going to be consistent. Remember we are structured maybe a little bit uniquely in the sense that we bring containerboard to market, if the three distinct channels, our own box network open market in North America to companies that provide a certain service in the box market and the long-term partners of ours, but we don't make the box and then our export. So much you have seen and you will continue to see is movement of containerboard within those three channels. And obviously, we have favored the U.S. box market as much as we can, but trying to continue over time, not just in the second quarter of 2021, but over time get the highest possible margins at our business by participating in ultimately those channels. Containerboards you're right, is a high demand product all over the law, but recycled and virgin, we obviously only export the virgin, we saw the virgin version of it. Box capacity, we've been actively investing locally with the acquisitions we did with that in the early part of the past period, we had a lot of opportunities to fill out existing plans by adding single or a double lines of box making equipment. We've built a few plants and we've acquired a couple of partnerships, but there's definitely opportunity for us to continue to invest in our converting network. The other option with converting as you well know, Mark is when you know demand looks like it's going to be solid. You can bring on more employees and actually fill out an extra shift in many plants. And you've got lean capacity turned into productive capacity. You obviously want to do that when you're pretty sure. And first do it with over time and then you do them with permanent employees. That's a challenge right now, given the main market dynamics, but we've got several levers to pull to continue to invest in not only box capacity, but the kinds of capability we have, e-commerce specific assets for example, is something that we're also bringing to market. Mark Wilde : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Mark. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thanks. Tim mentioned that white paper price mix maybe about $30 million, but when I look at overall revenue per ton in this segment, we've got only a couple of bucks, which implies that maybe oversees price mix was flat or even down. Can you talk about price index across your system, particularly outside the U.S. on the white paper side? Tim Nicholls : On white paper side, it\u2019s just a little bit muffled coming through. So when you are talking about looking forward, Mark. Mark Connelly : No, I'm curious, what's happening in the system right now. It looks like you got some gains in the U.S. but you didn't really get much across the entire white paper business? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Well, I mean, all the regions we're seeing price increases or realization of price increases in some degree, some of this in other regions started earlier in the year. So Russia was kind of on the forefront earlier in the year, implementing a price increase. Brazil as well, domestically so those are sort of \u2013 they're running their course and playing out where we still see traction in North America and in some of the export markets as well. Mark Connelly : Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And Mark, just to switch gears completely I'm curious what your position is on this packaging stewardship legislation that we're starting to see, as states try to create incentives to reduce \u2013 you've pointed to the growth in e-commerce, which some of these states are pointing to as part of the problem. But how do you \u2013 ASPA is against containerboards being included? So how do you think about containerboard industry responsibility, what should it be, if the legislation should not apply to you? Mark Sutton : I think if you look at the legislation in detail, there's a federal view that's kind of in its nascent stage. And there's a state by state view and we are actively working in the state by state legislatures. The big issue and the big goal of this extended producer responsibility tech legislation was really targeted non-recyclable or hard to recycle in many cases, plastics. In some cases that has led people to believe all packaging should be included. So the first thing is separating the facts of what corrugated packaging can do, and actually corrugated packaging could be a solution to the problem because of the high recycling rates. But that message has to get to policy makers. And we worked very hard on that. I spend a fair amount of my personal time talking to people about that. And in many cases, it's a new learning mark for people at the local level, that there is a completely different story on fiber-based packaging, it's made from renewable resource and a high recycling rate in the 90% range versus many of the other substrate choices. So I think that's the case we're making that is actually part of the solution, not part of the problem. But as usual in legislation, sometimes it starts with a blanket, all packaging needs to be managed in a different way and people need to be responsible for their packaging that they put out there when we have a system. So for example, we spend a lot of times and it's in there right now. On the infrastructure work that commerce is working on, in that bipartisan agreement, they made yesterday a significant amount of investment in recycling networks in the country is part of that. We'll see if it stays in there, but that's the answer is improving recycling rates for even to recycle and reuse materials. That's the value proposition for corrugated packaging, not being included in the intent of similar legislation. Mark Connelly : That's super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Philip Ng : Hey, good morning, everyone. Appreciating the winter storms was a big hit for you guys, but Tim or Mark, do you expect inventory gaining back to a more manageable level for containerboard in 3Q, where you'll be able to better capitalize on the growth we're seeing and get operating costs back to more normalized level, making the past. You've always kind of targeted to grow faster than the market, but any color on kind of gained back on track on that goal. Mark Sutton : Phil, we think it will be a steady progress. It won't be all solved in the third quarter. We think we'll make steady progress through the second half of the year. We have targeted to grow at or slightly above the market over time. We were really hampered in their ability to do that in the last couple of quarters because of the issues you just mentioned. But we will definitely have more options available for incremental growth as we go forward. Just based on the fact that we won't have so much of our system down for maintenance, but it will take a slow and steady progress month after month through the second half. Philip Ng : So we should still expect you to lag the market a little bit in 3Q and\u2026 Mark Sutton : Not necessarily, not necessarily, a part in what happens in 90 days, but that's a pretty short period of time. Part of what happens in the 90 day period is your segment exposure and what happens in seasonality if you've got more of this versus that. And so I think you should \u2013 I wouldn't automatically assume the lag the market. But I think it will take us the next second half of the year to get to the point where we feel comfortable that our inventories are more sustainable. I think the first thing we'll see is we won't miss any sales. The second thing we'll see is our costs will come down. Philip Ng : Super helpful and then pulp prices appreciate its volatile nature. It's a commodity both softwood and fluff pulp prices really surge this year, but the market appears to have softened up a bit. What's your crystal ball saying in terms of pricing for fluffing softwood pulp globally? And do you have a view in terms of how much inventory levels are in the channel? It's tougher to gauge just given some of the logistical bottlenecks you guys are seeing in the market? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I wouldn't want to forecast price looking forward. I've talked about how we think about the mom of what we believe we're seeing. We're seeing a bit of a pullback in some of the markets. Our view at the moment is that things are more stable. And look at not only the underlying demand models but the transportation difficulties, which are really in effect extending supply chains at this point. So you're right, full commodity product, but our view at the moment is this is a bit of a correction, not a complete turn. Philip Ng : Okay. Super helpful, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from Keybanc. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. Hope you're well. Mark, one more on pulp and then I have a containerboard question. I appreciate your comments that you expect segment margins to improve over the next several quarters. But when I looked at the last 10 quarters, it's been a pretty tough slog for the business. And as Phil just said, prices in China have been coming down of late. So I guess, what gives you confidence just given what's happened over the past two to three years, that this is a business in which you have a meaningful, competitive advantage? Mark Sutton : Well, if you think about the remarks, I made a couple of questions ago about what we're changing in the business versus the last 10 months or the last 10 quarters. That's what gives me confidence that this is a very value creating material for our end user customers. And we just happen to always extract it that proper value that gives us a value creating return. And that's what we're working on. I think the growth rate will stay solid as economies around the world improve. So there's a growth component, but we're going to run the business in a different way than it's been run before. When we made the decision to invest in the business, it changes the profile of this being a legitimate first rate business for a company versus in many cases, a smaller side sideline type of business. And some of that's reflected in some of the way the commercial agreements have been made. And we're working on changing that for the better. Adam Josephson : I appreciate that Mark. And just one on boxed and I think you mentioned earlier in the call that long-term you think the market could be at the high end of that 1% to 2% range that you were talking about? I just want to make sure I understand that. So let's say the market is up another 4% this year after 3.5%, you're talking about kind of an 8% step change upward post-pandemic in a market that had been growing at 1% per annum. Are you thinking that we're going to keep stay at these higher levels and grow on top of that or that there could be some correction as retail sales normalize, and then we'll get back to some kind of growth trend? Mark Sutton : Yes, that's \u2013 I mean, it's hard to predict that with certainty obviously, but we believe that part of what\u2019s happening is the goal that fiber-based packaging is playing in general commerce driven by a few segments, has taken a step change off. And so we think the base will be stronger. It depends on a lot of things and number one, the structure of the U.S. economy. And so if there is really action on some of the things that have been learned now around supply chains and global issues with supply chains and we do have more manufacturing that actually occurs in the U.S. for certain components, I think that'll bode well for the business and then how strong the consumer is going forward. Coming out of this, I think you're looking at maybe what's going to be close to two years of pent-up demand by consumers because of the things that happened during the pandemic and how that plays out and consumption will play a big role in what that growth rates going to be. I think the data, we have this model we use, I know others have models. There's third parties that are models, a correlation around GDP and has been slightly less, has been what's happened in the box market. And we think that'll still stand and it looks like we're poised to have a stronger consumption oriented GDP or at least as far as you can see right now. Adam Josephson : Terrific, thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks much. Just a question on pulp, I understand you guys are making some operational improvements and I\u2019m just trying to balance that with the Q3 guide here, where you've got opt-in costs up five million stories, there's something on the cost side that more than offsetting the operational improvement that you're seeing. And then if you could give us sort of a scope as to what the big bogey is there for three to five years out in terms of the things that you guys can control. I, how much improvement do you expect that that segment to have over that period of time. Mark Sutton : On the longer term part, I'll ask Tim to look for that cost offset part of your question. But on the longer term, we believe as a combination of how we operate. So in the manufacturing sector and the kind of the cost structure of our build system, and I've said this before, especially the part that was the legacy IP system, which is mostly converted mills from other products versus what we acquire with warehouse or which is most, all built for purpose. So they tend to have a better efficiency and lower costs. We've got opportunities to lower the cost, primarily in the legacy IP in factoring system, coupled that with commercial arrangements improvements that we're talking about and that we're doing now, you put those two together. We should have the margin structure to have a solid business above the cost of capital with a slight growth potential. So that's what we are working on. And we see a path to that. It will be a steady path, quarter by quarter and that's where we're heading. And the question on the cost on account, it's modest, but it's really transportation. I mean, we're continuing to battle the transportation in general. I think part of the transportation issue in this business, Paul is export port congestion, much more exposed to international causes break than the other businesses in the company. Paul Quinn : Right. Thanks very much. Most of that's helpful. Operator : That's a lot. Your next question comes from Neel Kumar from Morgan Stanley. Neel Kumar : Hi, good morning. You mentioned would cost being higher sequentially, partly because of the wet weather. So you're getting a sense of the magnitude of inflation you're seeing there, and you certainly see more of a 3Q issue or it's going to carry over into the fourth quarter as well. Mark Sutton : Yes, it's really due to having access to the fiber as being able to get it out of the woods based on the rainfall that we've had. So we looked at it very long lead time in terms of how we manage what inventories that mills and across basins and it's really been the Gulf states that have been more heavily impacted but some of the Southeastern mills as well. So depending on the weather as we go through the rest of this quarter into the fourth, but our inventories are in decent shape, but they're a little on the low side and it's just going to cost more to get the blood out and get it to the mills. Transportation's not helping either. I mean, we've referenced inbound materials and whatnot and that's seemingly impacting everything. Neel Kumar : All right, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of your maintenance outage expenses, and you're now forecasting $642 million for the full year, I know it's early, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about 2022 maintenance, each I could expect down year-over-year are generally remain near 2021 levels. Tim Nicholls : Well, we're still working through that. I mean, I think a good way to look at it. The way I'm looking at it last year was an abnormally linear. This year is a little bit of a out of range high here. When you put the two of them together, it looks roughly in line. I mean, our outages can be anywhere from 500 to 500 million to a little bit less or maybe some years, a little bit more pushing 550 last year, given all the uncertainty we pulled back and per sales this year. We're catching up on some of those outages from last year. So we put the two together what's more normal. Next year, we have to take a short planning. We always provide that as we \u2013 near the end of the year and look into the coming year. Neel Kumar : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our last question for today comes from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to talk about some of your end markets in a corrugated packaging. How is e-commerce performing relative to your initial expectations at the start of the quarter, any slowdowns there that you see, how's the recovery in food service going, any details on the end markets so you can provide? Mark Sutton : Thank you. On e-commerce no disappointments still very, very strong. And then we're getting into the period of the year where you start to build for the year end demand increases as you move toward holiday season. So still a very strong story. We're continuing to invest in that segment. Food service continuing to improve, I guess, there's a question mark about what happens with Delta variant and COVID, whether everything continues to open. I think that a big question, Mark, our big potential upside is as schools and events start to open food service related to those, which obviously hasn't been opened during the summer as is another potential upside. If that in any way, shape or form gets delayed and the food service growth could slow a little bit, the only segment that I think it's kind of predictable that maybe saw some flattening with processed food. And I think it's directly related to the general opening of the economy and a little less stocking up of kind of the center of the grocery store, if you will. So good strong performance across the key segments and we believe listening to our customers and looking at order patterns that\u2019s continuing has been going to the third quarter. Kyle White : That's helpful. And then focusing on transportation, I know it's early, but when you look to next year. Do you see any real relief or kind of stabilization and transportation costs, or do you anticipate kind of continuing inflation headwinds? And is there anything internally maybe that you can do to provide some relief against these costs? Mark Sutton : Well, internally the best thing we can do on the cost side is to have our system optimized with the right inventories and what that means is make a product in the right factory so that the transportation costs to the customer or in the case of our industrial packaging business, our containerboard mill makes containerboard for box plants that are nearby, not loss plants that are all the way across the country. So that's the number one thing on cost that we can do internally, we don't \u2013 we all have our own trucking company or anything like that. It's about really optimizing our supply chain and any dramatic improvements we can make on cost. So your first part of your question, I don't know this for sure, but looking at what the analysts that follow the transportation industry talk about is that there is a belief that labor and some of the impediments to Trump capacity and the training that's required to bring on more employees and more assets in the rail industry will get better and people will want to return to those industries. Many of those companies laid off a lot of people, you can't just bring people back in rail, there's required training and other things, same thing for trucks. And the belief is that that'll get better. So capacity should get better. If the economy stays kind of red hot and it's a good problem to have, but then I think capacity will get absorbed pretty quickly. So we think it's really disruptive right now and velocity is really slow for a lot of reasons. We think part of that, at least on the human labor side, we'll get better. Kyle White : Got it. Thank you for all the details. Mark Sutton : Thank you. Let me go ahead and wrap up just a couple of takeaways. I would like to leave with investors. First, you heard today that we are really positive on the strong momentum we're building for the second half. Both earnings and margin expansion were absolutely laser-focused on capital allocation and a balanced approach to that. And we are in very good shape, all elements that our capital allocation framework and we're very excited about the prospects we have in front of us, as we separate IP into two companies and we work on building a better IP going forward. So thank you for you're interested in International Paper. We look forward to talking with all of you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's International Paper second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Anjay. Good morning and thank you for joining International Papers third quarter 2021 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter 2021 earnings press release, and today's presentation slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim joint venture, Slide 2 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3. In the third quarter, International Paper grew revenue, earnings, and margins. And we continue to generate strong cash from operations. We continue to see strong demand for corrugated packaging and solid demand for absorbing [Indiscernible]. We're making strong progress on price realization from our prior increases. Having said that, the supply chain and input cost environment remains very challenging. It impacted our results much more than we anticipated. The widespread supply chain constraints limited our ability, to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong level of demand that we're seeing. Our middles performed well. However, stretched supply chains impacted volume in our industrial packaging, and global cellulose fibers businesses. Container board inventories in our packaging network improved, in the latter part of the third quarter. And we are in a much better position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth-quarter. Input costs in the third quarter rose by about $230 million or $0.46 per share. Which was more than 2 times what we had anticipated, with cost pressure in just about every category. Our Ilim joint venture delivered another strong performance, with equity earnings of $95 million. On capital allocation, we continue to make significant progress, strengthening our Balance Sheet. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million. I would also highlight that our pension plan is fully funded. This is a significant milestone that further strengthens the Company. In the third quarter, we also returned $411 million to our share owners, including $212 million of share repurchases. On October 1st, we completed the spin-off of the Printing Papers business. IP received a $1.4 billion payment from Sovamo and we retained a 19.9% interest in the new Company, which we intend to monetize within one year. The teams did an outstanding job executing the transaction in a very challenging environment. The Printing Papers business delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, and we wish Sovamo all the best as they move forward as a stand alone Company. We're laser-focused on strengthening the Company and building a better IP for all of our stakeholders. Tim and I will share more about the progress we're making during today's discussion. Turning now to Slide 4, we delivered EBITDA of $938 million, and free cash flow of $519 million in the third quarter, which brings our free cash flow nearly 1.6 billion year-to-date. Revenue increased by nearly 600 million or 12% when compared to last year. And if we exclude the Printing Papers business, third quarter revenue grew by 14% as compared to last year. We also expanded our margins in the third quarter with realization of our prior price increases. We expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. I will now turn it over to Tim to cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim. Tim Nicholls : Thanks, Mark. Moving to the Quarter-Over-Quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5, Third quarter operating earnings per share were a $1.35, as compared to a $1.06 in second quarter. Price and mix improved by $0.43 per share, was strong price realization across the three businesses. Volume decreased sequentially. Supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefit of the strong demand backdrop. We replenished our container board inventories in the latter part of the third quarter, which positions us well, entering the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our Cellulose Fibers business, demand for absorbent pulp is solid. Our pulp shipments were constrained due to significant port congestion, and our backlogs remain stretched. Our mills performed well. Operating costs benefited by about $35 million of one-time items, including the sale of nitrogen credits and insurance recovery related to the winter storm earlier this year. Supply chains are stretched and transportation costs are elevated for both inbound materials and outbound shipments. Every mode of transportation is tight and we expect the transportation environment to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Maintenance costs decreased as expected. Input costs rose by $0.46 per share, or about $230 million, which is more than double what we had anticipated for the quarter. Higher fiber and energy costs accounted for about 80% of this increase. Corporate expenses were essentially flat, tax expense was lower by $0.04 per share in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate of 18% as compared to 21% in the second quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to our federal tax provision after finalizing our 2020 tax return in the third quarter. Equity earnings were lower sequentially following the final monetization of our stake in GPK in the second quarter. Turning to the segments, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6, We are seeing strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets, and containerboard. Third quarter shipment across our U.S. channels improved by 1.3% year-over-year. However, box shipments were hampered by low containerboard inventories, and stretched supply chains. We successfully replenished inventories across our box system in the latter part of the third quarter, which puts us in a much better inventory position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter. We expect supply chains to remain stretched for the foreseeable future, which requires us to carry more inventory given the slower velocity across our network. To put the velocity and the context, our mill-to-box plant container board supply chain is currently running 3 to 4 days longer than our normalized flow. And in some lanes even longer. Taking a look at third quarter performance, price and mix was strong. Our March increases essentially fully implemented, with 128 million of price realization in the third quarter. Volume was lower by $45 million box shipments in North America were impacted by low containerboard inventory, especially in the first half of the quarter. Volume and EMEA was seasonally slower as expected, representing about $10 million of a sequential decrease. Operations and costs were essentially flat sequentially. Our mill system performed at a 100% and providing much needed inventory relief to our box system. In the third quarter, we also received insurance proceeds of about $15 million related to the winter store. These benefits were largely offset by unplanned maintenance costs. We're not seeing any relief on supply chain costs, and our managing risk associated with transportation capacity and congestion across the rail and truck networks. Input costs increased by nearly $190 million in the quarter. OCC and Woodfibre accounted for 120 million of that total. Energy accounted for another $45 million primarily in our recycled containerboard mills and our box plants. Taking a closer look at fiber, our North American packaging fiber mix is around 65% virgin wood and 35% OCC. Wood fiber cost was sharply in the third quarter due to continued wet conditions, across the Southern and Eastern regions, as well as inbound transportation constraints. Wood inventories are below our control limits, and we expect difficult operating conditions again in the fourth quarter. We expect demand for OCC to remain strong with no cost relief, even as generation gradually improves. As a reminder, we consume about 4.5 million tons annually in the U.S. and nearly 0.5 million tons in EMEA. Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 7, the business delivered earnings of $96 million. Third quarter segment earnings included 13 million from this Sovamo subsidiary and Kwidzyn mill, which are no longer part of our operations in the fourth quarter. Looking at our sequential earnings, price and mix improved by $59 million. Volume improved by 11 million sequentially, demand for fluff pulp, which represents about 75% of our mix remains solid. Our shipments continue to be negatively impacted by unprecedented port congestion and vessel delays. Keep in mind, we explored about 90% of our volume in this business. The majority of this is fluff pulp that ships and containers. Which is where port congestion is especially challenging. We have systems in place to manage through this environment. However, vessel delays and higher supply chain costs are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Our middles performed well. We also benefited from about $20 million, of one-time items related to the sell of nitrogen credits, and lower corporate costs in the quarter. These benefits were largely offset by $50 million of higher supply chain costs for export operations. In this outage costs decreased sequentially, while input costs were a significant headwind in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher wood and chemical costs. Turning to Printing Papers on slide eight, the business delivered earnings of 106 million in the third quarter with strong momentum ahead of the spin-off. Third quarter results included the Kwidzyn mill until the sell on August 6. Performance in the third quarter was strong with continued demand recover globally and price realization outpacing rising input costs. Now that the spin-off is complete, the historical results of the business will be treated as a discontinued operation with a full recast of previous periods. And going forward, activity pertaining to the Printing Papers off-take agreement for Riverdale or Georgedale will be included in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fiber segment earnings. I do want to echo Mark Sutton and thank our teams for successfully executing the spin in a very challenging environment. Looking to the Ilim results on Slide 9, the joint venture delivered another quarter of strong performance with equity earnings of 95 million and an EBITDA margin of 44%. Solid price realization for pulp and containerboard were partially offset by lower volume due to high planned maintenance outages in the quarter as expected. Volume in the fourth quarter is expected to improve. However, shipping capacity remains tight and supply chains to China are stretched. So now we'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook on Slide 10. In industrial packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $70 million, mostly on the realization of our August 2021 price increase. That includes a negative mix impact as we start to recover some export backlogs. Volume is expected to improve by $65 million sequentially, on strong seasonal demand. Even as we have set down three shipping days. Operations and costs are expected to improve by 5 million, with the North American system benefiting from improved containerboard inventory levels, partly offset by onetime benefits in the third quarter. Staying with industrial packaging, maintenance, outage expense is expected to increase by $3 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $50 million, mostly on the flow-through of higher third quarter input costs were fiber and energy. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $25 million, due to the non-repeat of one-time benefits in the third quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $37 million and input costs are expected to increase by $15 million on higher wood and energy costs. On our outlook slide, we include the sequential earnings adjustment associated with the Printing Papers spin and Kwidzyn sale for a total of $134 million across the three segments. With regard to cash flow, I would note that our cash from operations in the second half 2021 includes cash taxes of about $450 million associated with the various monetization transactions from earlier this year. Remember that the proceeds for these transactions are not captured in our free cash flow. However, the result in cash taxes are included in free cash flow and the majority will be paid in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 11, I will take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the third quarter, and what you can expect from International Paper following the recent Papers then. we will maintain a strong Balance Sheet. As we previously said, we're comfortable taking our leverage below the stated target of 2.5 to 2.8 times debt EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million, which brings our year-to-date debt reduction to 1.1 billion. We will also complete an additional 800 million of debt repayment by the end of this month. Taking a look at pension, we're very pleased with the performance of our plan this year. Our qualified pension plan is fully funded, and we feel really good about the actions we've taken to improve performance, and de -risk the plan. Returning cash to shareowners is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the third quarter, we returned $411 million to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases were $212 million, which represented about 3.6 million shares at an average price of $59.13. Also earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which raises our total available authorizations to 3.3 billion. We will continue to execute on that authorization in a manner that maximizes value for shareowners over time. With regard to the dividend, our policy does not change. We're committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. Earlier this month, we decreased our dividend by 9.8% to $1.85 per share annually following the spin-off of the Papers business. This adjustment is well below the 15% to 20% proportion of cash previously generated by the Papers business as we outlined from when we announced the spin last year. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We expect capex in 2021 to be around $600 million, which is less than our original plan. Primarily, due to the timing of equipment delivery and a more challenging contract labor environment. We will continue to proactively manage capex and have the ability to increase or pull back if circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build up capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth. We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement, our goal of accelerating profitable growth. We can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities and our packaging business, in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must be compelling value for our shareholders. And with that I will turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Tim, for all the details. I on the slide 12 now. Let's talk about the future and how we're going to accelerate value creation for IP and our share owners. We are building a better IP. At the recent spin-off of the Papers business, IP is really a corrugated Packaging focused Company. We're significantly less complex with a much narrower geographic footprint. In addition, we have strengthened the Company's financial footing, as Tim has described, significantly over the past few years. Our focus profile and financial strength will further enable us to make sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation. As I said earlier in the process, we've been actively working on multiple streams of earnings initiatives over the past year. We established a dedicated team that's been working closely with our businesses and external partners over the past year to identify, develop, and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities, which are now moving to scaled implementation. Let's turn to Slide 13 to see how our earnings drivers ramp up over the next few years. We will deliver $200 to $225 million of gross incremental earnings in 2022. That represents more than two times the dis-synergies resulting from the spin-off. Our value drivers ramp up in '23 and 2024 with net incremental earnings of $350 to $400 million in 2024. These include around 300 million in cost reduction initiatives. And at least 50 million through commercial and investment initiatives. Our earnings catalysts are front loaded with significant benefits coming in 2022 from streamlining and simplifying the Company and scaling a wide range of process optimization initiatives. Streamlining and simplifying is all about agility and effectiveness, the organization is being designed to support a packaging focused Company with a more focused footprint. We are aligning our talent to accelerate performance. We've also examined our processes to increase efficiency and reduce cost. We are implementing and scaling new approaches for areas such as sourcing, supply chain and operations by leveraging technology and data analytics. Let me give you a few examples of these value drivers for 2022. We redesigned our sourcing process for our 200 converting facilities. We're using data analytics and third-party partners to deploy an automated catalog of sourcing options for operating and repair materials in our box plants. This program will deliver meaningful value in 2022. We're also using Data Analytics to unlock capacity in our converting facilities by improving our planning and order execution process. This includes, for example, how we aggregate and planned smaller orders, and how we can optimize our manufacturing mix, in each plant and each network of plants. We have also developed a new application to further optimize containerboard replenishment to our box plants. A system anticipates potential role inventory stockouts, which had been a big issue for us this year, and recommend the lowest cost replenishment option, to reduce premium freight. There are many initiatives that contribute to our value drivers and the savings. We have really good line of sight on the expected benefits in 2022, and the ramp up as we move forward. Our 2022 value drivers not only deliver meaningful benefits in the near term, they are also setting the foundation for IP going forward to accelerate commercial and investment excellence to drive profitable growth. So with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Hey guys. It's been a challenging few quarters industrial decide. A pretty healthy demand backdrop, so with inventory normalizing for you guys and pricing, flooring through, when do you actually expect EBITDA margins and EBITDA dollar to be up year-over-year Industrial. And now that you have inventory at a more respectable level, do you expect your box inventory attract more in line with the broad industry in the fourth quarter? Mark Sutton : That's a great question, Phil. What we talked about on our second quarter is we thought it would take at least till the end of the year to get the inventory situation where it wasn't constrained. I think we made a little more progress than we expected in third quarter. And most importantly, September was a lot better than July. but we still have some spotty issues depending on the grade, and the type of end-use box. But we see as we enter into the fourth quarter, the progress we made in the third quarter, we should be getting close to our ability from a Board supply, to really track our own box shipments with the market. And we will continue to see EBITDA margin and absolute EBITDA improvement, as we go forward. As you know, and as we outlined and Tim talked about, we got it wrong on a number of our cost initiatives, in our outlook for the fourth -- for the third quarter. That obviously, took a bite out of our EBITDA margins. We really expected to be, EBITDA margins in the 20 - ish plus percent in the third quarter and we didn't get there, primarily on the back of some costs that were as I said, in some cases, twice as much as we thought they would be. Some of those costs like OCC are our own estimates about supply, demand and generation, and where we're going to buy it from and what the transportation component is. And some of those costs are simply public information that I think all investors use like the natural gas strip and things that are kind of publicly available and in a big way, we sort all got it wrong on that sense, but I'm encouraged that we're making progress. We're going to get the -- as we mentioned, the price flow-through is going well and we're going to see our margins expand. And we are positioning the Company to have no reason why we can't grow in box and in our other channels, which we had a lot of success. A board that goes whether it's to our equity partners or whether it's pure open market. And that goes into the U.S. box business as well. That overall, three-channel approach, we're doing quite well. Our own box plants have suffered primarily from the ability of us to get the right containerboard into the right plant at the right time. It may show up two weeks late and the order had to be made two weeks earlier. So that's in a lot better shape and I feel good about that right now. Phil Ng : Got it, Mark. That's helpful. As a school of thought, I mean, I think a lot of people have thought four weeks of inventory is about balance, but appreciating the challenges the entire industry is seeing on -- from a supply chain, what's balance for you? Because when we looked at the inventory data from the box data, it really perked up a bit. It raise some alarms. But give in some of the supply chain dynamics, help us understand what's a good level in this backdrop. Tim Nicholls : Hey, Phil, it's Tim. So right now, I think we've mentioned it in some of the comments as we went through the slides. But we're 3 to 4 days longer or slower, in terms of velocity, to get more from the mill to the box plants, than what we would be in a more normalized type of environment. So just think about the size of our system that's a pretty big number. Just to make sure that more is arriving in time to be consumed for box customers. Mark Sutton : So I think the native Tim 's comments as we don't know if that 3 days to 4 days is going to go to 5. It depends on velocity through trucking and rail, primarily for container board ports or more of an issue for Cellulose Fibers. But planning for that, one, two and three months out, is what we're doing now. And I think you're going to probably see for IP, I know, inventory above our normal historical is a good investment right now because it leads almost automatically to a sale of a box. Phil Ng : Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one for me. Certainly generate a lot of cash, you've announced a sizable buyback program and have about 3 billion buyback available. Any color on the pace in will you look to use vehicles like KSRs and just broadly. How do you plan on deploying some of that excess cash on your Balance Sheet in the near-term? Tim Nicholls : Yes good questions. The summary comment would be we've not changed the framework of how we think about capital allocation and deployment. We've done a lot to try to de -risk the Company through Balance Sheet and pension. As I mentioned in the comments, our qualified plans now fully funded and it's been a long time since we've been in that position. So going a little bit lower on leverage is something we've been pointing to for probably more than a year now. On share repurchases, we are -- good news is we have the added authorization to work with. We're going to constantly be looking at how we're trading versus our view of intrinsic value and will modulate as we go through in time based on that view. Mark Sutton : I think the thing I would add to Tim 's comment, Phil, on the capital allocation fees, we've never been in recent memory or even distant memory in the position we are in today, relative to our Balance Sheet, the cash generation and the ability to really consistently move cash through all elements of our value creation framework. So we're committed to the dividend. I think investors and everyone that follows us knows that. Share repurchases had been spotty. We're in a position now to have that be consistent. As Tim said, based on our view of intrinsic value and how we think about trying our best to do that as smartly as we can, but it will be consistent. And then, on the investment in our own business, investing in our current cash flow, meaning our current facilities, investing in cost reduction, and investing in smart growth, which tends to be in our system, bolt-on type of growth. That's really what we're planning on doing. And we're in a position for the first time in a long time to be able to actually do that, and do that well, and do it consistently. Phil Ng : That's great color, great to have that all optionally. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Tim Nicholls : Morning. Anthony Pettinari : The detail on the value-creation initiatives is really helpful. There's a reference on the slide to meaningful improvement in Global Cellulose Fibers Performance. And I'm just wondering if you can talk maybe broadly about the drivers to improve that performance. And then, we've seen other paper and packaging companies where the benefits from some of these large initiatives, maybe ultimately get competed away. I'm just wondering if you could talk about your confidence that you will see this fully fall to the bottom-line. Mark Sutton : Our plan obviously is to not let them get competed away. Some of the initiatives are, we can leave a bit unique to higher scale and footprint. And it's going to be our job not to let them get competed away. On the Cellulose Fibers questions specifically, this is an ongoing story of improvement in the way the business operates, the way the business goes to market. As I mentioned, I think two quarters ago, we should expect a steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in the performance of the business, and we're seeing that. We're seeing that despite some of the unforeseen supply-chain issues which, don't worry me so much strategically because, I don't believe that will be a permanent state of port velocities and all of those kinds of things. I think we will have a much better business commercially on the customer mix, the pricing strategies, the contract mechanisms. As I mentioned, a couple of quarters ago, that's a multiple quarter process. And I said we should see quarterly check-in points like we're doing today. In which you'd see continued improvement, and we had a really strong third quarter. I think we'll continue to see that, I think the supply chain will normalize, no one knows for sure when maybe second half of next year, I don't know. But the running of the business for the long term with the right customers and the right commercial arrangements will continue to produce long-term improvement in the business. And so, the value drivers I outlined that are in the Data Analytics category, a lot of that has to do with International Paper specific initiatives. There are other initiatives that are maybe more generic, that are in the plan, and then we're scaling, but we feel real confident that this is an opportunity for us to step up our earnings. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just maybe staying on Cellulose Fibers. China 's implemented this dual control policy, which I think has shut down a lot of capacity, maybe including some converters that are buying pulp. It's hard for us to fully gauge what's going on, on the ground. Can you just remind us the percentage of your Cellulose Fibers sales that are going to China. And then the impact, if any, from the stool control policy, it seems like fluff prices have actually shown a fair amount of stability. So just wondering any comments there. Mark Sutton : So the rough percentage of our fluff that goes to China is in the 30 - ish percent range. So about a third of our absorbent products goes there. And we have a really -- the majority of that 30% is premium customers and converters. And so we haven't seen a major impact from those issues. I think some of those that are affected more are smaller, I will call it, Chinese only companies not multinationals. And the benefit of dealing with a multinational value chain is that you have predictable customers who get [Indiscernible] navigate those things. The challenge is it's large buyers with sophisticated purchasing procedures and contracts. But we like the customers we have especially given some of these things that are going on. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Mark, good morning Tim. Mark Sutton : Hi Mark. Mark Wilde : Two more Mark, I wondered if you could just help us unpack the cost pressures in Industrial Packaging with maybe a little more detail and maybe segmented between of North America and Europe. It looks like if we go back through your last four quarterly bridges that your costs in Industrial Packaging were up approximately a 100 ton upon over the last four quarters. So maybe just a little more detail around that. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. I mean, between the U.S. or North American and Europe and just given the scale of the business. Most of it is going to be in North America, and really, it's been the exposure to OCC, energy, and chemicals. I mean, more recently would but the longer-term stories before the wood impact in the third quarter, was really around OCC and energy costs, primarily natural gas. And it's moved rapidly. And so, I think that's what you're pointing out on your cost per ton number. And just trying to keep up with that with price. So year-over-year, we're a little bit ahead of that on price. Our opportunity now as we're implementing this current price increase, that margins can expand beyond what the input costs have done most recently. Mark Wilde : Tim, how much of that cost increase would you say is that the converting level? I just looked at your cost per thousand or per ton in the box business. You think about labor, you think about transportation, you think about all those inputs. How much will those costs be up? Tim Nicholls : I mean, we don't break it out like that, but there is an impact. A lot of it goes to the mills just thinking about the inputs you mentioned, and their consumption. But in the box and the box system, you have materials that are unique to converting. Think about wax and other things where, we have seen price escalation. Also, we're seeing higher labor costs kind of across all of our businesses, and converting is impacted there as well. So it's more on the mill side and converting, but converting for the cost structure that the converting plants have, it's not in material. Mark Sutton : I think Mark you're converting question Mark. The unique thing that's happening in converting given the demand is, on the labor side. Our employees have shown up every day and done a fabulous job through this entire pandemic. In some cases, we had plants that were designed pre -pandemic to run five days a week, which is not uncommon in the Box industry some worked 24/7 but not a lot of them. We've had to ramp up over time and our employees have had success at the challenge while we try to hire permanent employees, which has been a real challenge in certain parts of the country. So that elevates a big portion of converting cost is labor, unlike in a mill system where the cost trend to be the inputs. And then, transportation has been a real challenge. And again, some of it's regional. But I think those -- the cost increase is on the labor side, whether it's overtime review employees, it's still the right thing to do because it allows us to get more revenue and more sales. Mark Wilde : Yeah. And I guess for follow-on, I'm just curious, Mark, it's been a while since we talked about the ownership at Ilim. A few years ago, there was a lot of debate about whether it makes sense to have a bigger stake and to be able to consolidate the EBITDA. I'm also conscious that you've got kind of a single partner on the other side, who may have some estate planning to do. Can you just help us think about the ownership structure for Ilim going forward? Mark Sutton : We get that question either on calls or in meetings, and our answer is we like the structure we have right now. We think it's all things considered. So all things considered, the way the business is running geopolitics, the whole risk profile of the Company, the other things we had going on in the last couple of years to streamline IP. We believe the 50-50 joint ventures is the right structure. What we are working on is improving Ilim, and the Ilim team is doing a great job investing in their business and growing their business. It's the number one competitive position to serve softwood fiber products to China. And we want to try to find ways to get as much of that value reflected for that 50% ownership position into the shares of IP that we can. So the strong dividend we get, the equity earnings, the exposure to a fast-growing Chinese market in an innovative way, we hope will resonate over time. Ownership changes are always under consideration but it obviously wouldn't talk about something we haven't done. We are very comfortable with the structure we have right now. We have very good partners and we have a great management team that's running the business very-very well. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's really helpful. I mean, I think all of us on the outside could see why in a lot of respects that having a strong local market partner over there makes sense for IP. I will turn it over. Thanks. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks. Everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. Mark and Tim, I want to go back to slide 6. There's been this narrative from a lot of people in the industry that, labor shortages and supply chain, all things that we've been reading and hearing about. Have not only increased costs, but also prevented converters integrated companies, from hitting demand that they see ahead of them. And certainly you pointed that in that slide. Would it be fair to say that [Indiscernible] they are going to be some apples and oranges in this, that the difference between the 1.7% box shipment trend that you saw in the third quarter, relative to the channel growth that you saw or I think you saw, 1.3% was largely those constraints and maybe that's putting too fine a point on it. But what do you think was the loss volume opportunity in [Indiscernible] in the U.S. for you because of that and the related question would be, how much of that loss sales, whatever the number, winds up being recaptured, and how much is permanently lost. Because some things that we're shipping boxes for right now, we're not going to be having Hanukkah and Christmas in February or March. So how would you have us think about those two questions? Mark Sutton : I think on the reason for the shortfall, the quarter evolve something like this, July we still had more containerboard shortages in different parts of the box system. And we had a heavy order intake and in some cases we just couldn't take the orders. But I will tell you, the majority of the business that we're not getting is new and incremental business. We're not seating share in our existing customer base, so we're unable to always say yes to an order when order when a customer wants -- a new customer wants to give us additional business for the next few months or something, not a long-term contract. The biggest issue July was very difficult. August was better and we were much closer to the market in August. And in September, we were basically tracking with the market. So we improved through the quarter and for us it wasn't labor, labor is a cost issue for us. For us, it was mostly the containerboard availability in the right box [Indiscernible] at the right time. So our inventory recovered nicely in the quarter, but the majority of that recovery occurred in the last month of the quarter. So the foregoing sales really occurred in July and August and it was hard to go -- we couldn't go back and get those. That's why I'm confident even though it wasn't smooth through the quarter, we are entering the fourth quarter in a much healthier position. There is still, as I mentioned on my remarks, a few areas and a few segments that use a specific type of board that we might make it only two mills that we're still tight on. And depending on where demand is and how slow trucks and trains are, we may end up in an issue, but we are in a much better position. So labor wasn't our demand or growth issue, labor is a cost issue because we're asking people to work overtime to make more product. The Board availability was our primary issue. George Staphos : So Mark, would it be fair to say that again, there is 2% plus that was perhaps foregone. But you're in a pretty good position to recapture that in the fourth quarter, is that an over simplification? Mark Sutton : It's an oversimplification, but I know what question you're trying to ask and I would say yes. We don't believe we've lost demand. The kind of demand that we couldn't take in many cases is not demand that's loss. Our network is so flexible. Many, many customers that don't buy from us today, want us to be a part of their supply base. They still want us to be a part of their supply base in November when they come back to us. George Staphos : Okay. Thanks for that. One question on pulp and then one question just in terms of other things that you're doing at the Company to improve value. So as regards to pulp, and we covered this a lot on these calls. We and our colleague analyst. Yes, you saw improvement in the third quarter, but if we do the waterfall into the fourth quarter, we're back to relatively low EBITDA levels for Global Cellulose Fibers. Yes, fluff is less volatile, but we're seeing obviously, commodity paper grade prices dropping pretty sharply. And so, can you remind us what ultimately you would like to see -- what you think would be a fair EBITDA return for the business, for it to be a value creator within the IP portfolio. And then, my other question, you're obviously doing some tremendous things to improve costs and improve value within the Company, the spin of Sovamo, the cost reduction, and commercial initiatives. I think you mentioned at least a couple of times on this call today and we've heard it throughout earnings season already. These are unprecedented times in terms of costs and supply chain inflation. What other things might you be contemplating away from cost but on the commercial side, that might be reflective of a new paradigm and how IP might need to address these challenges to improve return of value for its shareholders going forward? Thank you and good luck in the quarter. Mark Sutton : Thank you George. And the first question on Cellulose Fibers, the business is a value-creating enterprise for IP when the EBITDA margins or just north of 20%. And we have that in the third quarter actually. We have value-creating returns and there were some oddities and one-offs. We got a cost structure right now that the business -- any -- no forest products business has ever seen and a supply chain going up that no one's ever seen. I don't believe any of that will be permanent. And so thinking about the business strategically, at the current price levels, at the improving commercial arrangements where we are getting paid for the value we provide for our customers and a future cost structure that is a little more normalized. I think we can be a lot closer to, and we will hit some quarters, whereas a purely value-creating enterprise. Then the question is, how do you get it to be their permanent mixing? We have our packaging business, and that's what we're working on. On the other investment question you asked. An example of some of the things we're working on that are not costs related, will be primarily almost all of our near-term investments will be in the converting system. Aside from just normal protection of cash flow in your mill investment. But things like ideas that we have started to pilot, and we've now done and it's working well. The wide range of customer segments we have. So e-commerce as a general set of customers and a segment is an entirely different set of demands in a plant than more general food uses for example, in boxes, and having e-commerce only, small focused facilities that are located, almost co-located with our customers is an example of investments that we're beginning to develop that will help us on the commercial side. It does two things : It puts the right assets for the right segments in place. And it keeps that business from detracting from the efficiency of the larger plant, which was never maybe built to do that type of packages at that kind of throughput. And so you immediately unlock capacity by making investment A, you've essentially made investment B, by just not running all that stuff in the current plants that it's running it. And you'll see more of that as we go forward. George Staphos : Alright. Thank you Mark. Thank you, Tim, I'll turnover. Have a good quarter. Mark Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thanks, Mark, Tim. So a couple of follow-ups. First just on George 's question, when he was asking about box shipments and you answered, what was an impairment for your relative performance, particularly in July. I think part of the question also is relating to the overall industry box demand in the third quarter looks lower than what people have been anticipating and whether how much of that is being impacted by supply chain or labor issues in the industry, or perhaps with the customer. Particularly given the cost environment that we're in, people are just trying to figure out what can be next steps here to get to the types of margins. And so, specific to from a overall industry perspective, is there a view you can share as to how much demand may have been temporarily depressed versus maybe there's just more generic slowing going on in the business environments? Tim Nicholls : Hey, Mark, it's Tim. So first of all, third-quarter, fourth-quarter comps are tougher given what happened last year. But I think what we're saying supply chain is affecting everyone. So you look across not only what we're doing in terms of trying to supply customers, but there are supply chain issues across almost every segment that we serve. And that probably I can't quantify it for you, but we know anecdotally that it exists. Mark Weintraub : So would you say those specific to the Containerboard or BUCKS Business, those supply chain issues and labor issues are also an impediment or is it more just -- more the customer level from where you sit? Tim Nicholls : No, I mean, we have experienced our own supply chain constraints. There have been at least 10 anecdotally issues of customer constraints as well; Hiring and being able to source and move product, is an issue that I think is widespread across the economy. Mark Sutton : Yeah. I think part of what you're hearing Mark about the concerns, about maybe the U.S. holiday season, will you be able to get everything you want? Because people are probably going to operate on their prior patterns, and they will start to look at shopping, whether it's brick-and-mortar online. In the November time period, I think there's going to potentially be a lot of disappointment and so the anecdotal comment Tim made is, customers have told us they could sell and ship more if they had more employees to run their factories. So they're working, they are doing just what we're doing. They're working overtime, they're trying to hire people, but everybody is trying to hire the same people. If you're in an industrial supply chain because it's semi to very skilled labor. And everybody is competing for the same people. And there aren't that many of them out there. That will at some point, I believe correct itself, because there is a ton of money as you all know, pent-up in people and companies to buy things, and I don't think that pent-up demand is going to go anywhere. We are probably going to pass through a period of frustration where people can't get everything they want, you see that in a number of segments. But I think the demand driver is the money people have to spend and consume, and that's not going anywhere. I think once we can all produce what the demand level is through the value chain, we will see, robust demand in the kinds of products that used corrugated for foreseeable future. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Great, sometimes you have in the past given an indication of where you thought year ahead box demand might be [Indiscernible] incredibly difficult to be predicting that right now. Perhaps why I'm asking the question, do you have a view as to what the next 6 to 12 months on the box demand side might hold, that you can share? Tim Nicholls : 6 to 12 months is looking out -- in this environment, looking out quite a long way. I think we feel good in the moment. We -- we're our cut-up as we are in October sequentially, is up between 4 and 5%. So we're taking it month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter. Mark Weintraub : And what is that year-over-year, I'm curious if you could share that for the October? Tim Nicholls : Probably flattish on a strong comp last year. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Great. And one last quick one. A follow-up too. You mentioned three to four days more cycle time in getting Board through the system. On a percentage base, what would it normally be? How big an increase is that relative to normal? Tim Nicholls : Well, we moved roughly 40+ thousand tons a day. So it's three to four, so a 120 to a 160 but in some lanes, it's more than four days. But it's a big number. Mark Weintraub : I'm sorry. I meant is it normally two weeks, three weeks, and it's an extra three or four days or what would the -- Tim Nicholls : Yeah. We don't typically talk about how we move products in between our facilities, but the increment is a big increment. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thanks Tim. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Mark and Tim, good morning. Hope you're well. Mark Sutton : Hi, Adam. Adam Josephson : Hey, Mark and Tim. Tim, just one on the dividend. so can you just talk your initial expectation obviously, last December is that you had reduced the dividend by 15% to 20%. In conjunction with the papers spend, you ultimately decided it would only be 10%. Can you just walk us through your thought process. Why 10 as opposed to the initial 15 to 20? Or no dividend reduction for that matter. Can you just walk us through anything, what transpired since last December along those lines? Tim Nicholls : At the time we were looking at historically the performance that Papers had contributed to, overall earnings and cash flow performance. And then as we've gone through the year, even though we would've wanted to perform better, had we not had some of these constraints and issues around the supply chain. We felt good about the performance and we felt good about as we look out into the next couple of years. The performance of the Company from a cash flow standpoint. So the key message was returning cash to shareowners is an important part of our capital allocation. And we do it partly through dividend and partly through share repurchases. And we felt like we had latitude to reduce the dividend by smaller amount than what we originally pointed to. Adam Josephson : Got it I appreciate that. And Tim, one more for you and then just one for Mark, just on the topic of guidance. I've asked you this on previous calls, but just given the enormous uncertainty, supply chain, inflation demand, you name it. How comfortable do you think you would see giving full-year guidance come next year now that the Paper spend is behind you, Kwidzyn sale is behind you, etc. Or are you concerned that there's just so little visibility that it may create more problems than it helps you by doing so. Tim Nicholls : Well, probably a lot of time and events that transpire between now, and the end of January when we report fourth quarter and think about 2022. Seeing some normalization to some of these issues that everyone's pointing to, would be helpful and probably necessary to give, a longer-term outlook for performance of the business, in a quantifiable way. But I do think given the issues that we've come from and where we are, having repaired the supply chain. Starting to scale the initiatives that Mark covered in his commentary, felt pretty good about how things are beginning to shape up for 2022. So let's see, let's see where we are, but it's something that's in the January. Adam Josephson : I appreciate that. And just Mark, one more on box demand for me, which is I think we're all caught offsides by what happened in the third quarter. We all expected some growth, or speaking for myself at least. The supply chain issues don't seem to be going away anytime soon. Is it reasonable to expect embedded in your volume guidance 3Q to 4Q if I think 65 million of growth in industrial packaging? Are you expecting to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter or flattish or can you just give us any sense of what you think you're going to do or the industry might do relative to the third quarter, which was obviously unexpectedly flat because of some of the issues you flagged? Mark Sutton : I think Tim mentioned the October experience so far and -- on a year-over-year and called it flattish. We would expect pretty close to last year. So flattish on a year-over-year basis, which is on a pretty -- as you know, out of a pretty tough [Indiscernible]. Adam Josephson : Yeah. Mark Sutton : For us, the confidence in that 65 million of earnings improvement from volume that Tim talked about, it's primarily, kind of, again, an IP specific. We are much better positioned with containerboard inventory going into this quarter so that we won't have to forego some of the sales opportunities we just couldn't meet in the, really, second and the third quarter. So that's why we feel confident. Again, our restriction was primarily our containerboard available. In theory we could have put containerboard to our box plants by cutting off other customers that are just as profitable and just as strategic, of course we didn't do that and we wouldn't do that. So now we are on the ability to take these very high value open market channels that have really been growing nicely, and our own box business and not be as constrained as we have been by containerboard. Downstream from us and including us, the labor component that our customers are dealing with, I think will begin to improve. I think the demand environment and the supply chain issues in the third quarter and the labor challenges, I think surprised a lot of people in a lot of different value chains. And of course they've been working on it. There's a lot of innovative approaches to hiring people right now. And that will produce some positive results, I believe in the fourth quarter. And at least from what our customers are telling us about their expected demand and what they want us to prepare for, they are planning on solving some of their -- for them mainly labor issues to have enough people to work to make the products they have demand for. So we think some of that will be getting better over the next few months. Adam Josephson : Okay. Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mark, Tim and Guillermo. I appreciate taking my questions today. Just two quick ones. Just realizing the supply chain, obviously, this tremendous headwinds to volumes. Can you talk just a little bit more about the specific end-markets themselves, and if there were any sectors that either stood out as being advantages or disadvantages? And then, just specifically on e-commerce, what are you seeing there? Particularly some of the larger e-commerce players, would it be Amazon or Etsy have indicated more modest growth. Mark Sutton : Well, we deal with most of the major players in E-commerce, whether it's B to C, E-commerce or B to D E-commerce. And our customers, the once we have and we don't speak for any of the industry, the ones that we have are still pretty bullish on their fourth quarter and are asking us to prepare for levels of demand that are still very, very strong. On the first part of your question around supply chain, I think anybody who's transportation heavy like, some of the food companies, are struggling with some of the same velocity issues that we're struggling with. Anybody who is taking in products from outside the U.S. and has to get through the ports, are running into product availability. Then on the labor side, I think it's a smattering really everywhere. The competition is most heated in the more populated areas. You might have a distribution center for an e-commerce player, and a box plant from IP, and two box plants from other people, and another light manufacturing of some type, all competing for skilled labor. If you're a food manufacturer in the middle of a rural area, your labor situations probably more manageable, and that's what we see. Our labor situation primarily shows up in our box plans, which are near cities and near a lot of labor competition. Our mills are more rural and they are in much better shape from a continuity of labor. Mike Roxland : And just following up on that quickly, so would you say that your demand and your ability to satisfy your demand is better away from major cities? Mark Sutton : No, not really. No, I was just making the comment on labor. The problem with being away from major cities in the box business, unless it's a food processor that's located rural, that's where the customers and box users are. So you -- it's a theoretical statement to say, I wish my box plants were away from cities. Most of the manufacturing products are near population centers on the box side. But if you go upstream in the value chain to where the container board is made, it's made near the forest, of course, in most cases. And so, it's just a less populated area. So labor availability and long-term labor loyalty to there employer is a lot higher. Mike Roxland : Got it. Just one quick follow-up. Just on Europe Industrial Packaging was negative feedback, 4 million for the quarter. Just some of the issues that drove that loss this quarter? Mark Sutton : I think the biggest issue in Europe, I think that's what you asked about Europe Packaging. There's 2 issues going on. We have one large recycled containerboard, so they're 100% exposed to the recovered Fiber market. And that cost really, really rose. And then you have the kind of unprecedented natural gas cost issues in Europe. And it will take a little bit of time for product pricing to catch up with that. So it was more of a timing quarter issue than a structural issue. Mike Roxland : Got it. Thanks again and good luck in the fourth quarter. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mike. Listen, you can tell from our conversation this morning, the questions and even our prepared remarks. It's really easy to live in this moment of craziness in the supply chain and really kind of dwell on it. But I'm personally confident that we'll continue to manage and overcome what we're dealing with today. We've got a tremendous team that's skilled [Indiscernible] operating and they do a great job every day, every week, every month. We do expect, as I mentioned in prepared remarks and in some of the answers to the questions that we expect our margins to recover further in the fourth quarter and we expect to be heading into 2022 with significant momentum. I'm equally confident and very optimistic about our future. We just showed you 2 slides today on some of the value drivers. We have a lot more to share with you as we go forward. We have the right plan, the right people to deliver on our commitments, to build a better IP. Tim took you through our capital allocation framework. I'll say it again, we haven't been in this position on cash generation and cash return ability in almost forever. And we're excited about building a good portion of our total shareholder return on -- return of cash to shareholders, dividend, share repurchase. And then the value drivers and the focused IP delivers the other half, which is going to come with the profitable growth that we have in our sites. So thank you for your interest in International Paper. We'd really look forward to speaking with you again in the future.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you Angie. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website contains copies of the fourth quarter 2021 earnings press release, and today's presentation slides. I would note that the Printing Papers business segment is now reflected as discontinued operations from 2019 to 2021. Lastly relative to the Ilim joint venture slide 2 provides context around the joint venture's financial information and statistical measures. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We will begin our discussion on slide 3. In 2021, we served a strong customer demand in a really highly challenging operating environment due to the continued uncertainties associated with COVID-19. I'm really proud and appreciative of the commitment of our employees to continue to take care of each other and to take care of our customers. Our employees' health and safety is our most important responsibility. Looking at our performance International Paper grew earnings and revenue while managing through significant operational and supply chain constraints. For much of 2021, we operated with a sub-optimized system, which limited our ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong demand backdrop. We made strong progress on price realization from prior increases to mitigate the impact of substantial cost pressure from inputs and distribution. While we anticipate the near-term operating environment to remain fluid, we expect to grow earnings meaningfully in 2022. We are building a better IP. We're a corrugated packaging focused company with less complexity and more focus. We've initiated meaningful actions to materially lower our cost structure and accelerate profitable growth. We have a strong balance sheet. We reduced debt by $2.5 billion in 2021, our pension plan is fully funded and we will invest to grow earnings and cash generation by building out capabilities and capacity in our US box system over the next few years. We are also well-positioned to return meaningful cash to shareholders. In 2021, we returned $1.6 billion to share owners including about $800 million in share repurchases. Turning to the full year results on slide 4. Revenue for International Paper increased by 10%, driven by strong price realization in our two business segments and operating earnings improved by 50%. The operating margins were impacted by input operating and distribution costs, which outpaced price realization. Looking at segment performance, earnings in our packaging segment decreased by about $100 million year-over-year with significant cost headwinds from fiber energy and distribution. While our earnings in our cellulose fibers business improved by about $200 million, driven by commercial improvements and price recovery. Equity earnings were $313 million driven by very strong performance from our Ilim joint venture, which delivered EBITDA of $1.1 billion in 2021. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion. I would note that free cash flow included about $500 million in tax payments related to the various monetization actions that we took in 2021 as well as payroll tax payments related to the CARES Act. Turning now to slide 5. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased by about $650 million or 15% compared to last year. We delivered EBITDA of $645 million. Margins decreased primarily due to higher operating maintenance and input costs. This was partially offset by price realization. And I would note that input costs were higher than anticipated. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was impacted by about $300 million in tax payments again related to the various monetization actions that we took throughout 2021 and the impact of the CARES Act. I'll now turn it over to Tim who will cover business performance and our outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6, which shows our year-over-year earnings bridge. Price and mix improved with strong price realization across all of our channels. Mix was also favorable driven by growth in higher-margin US packaging channels and lower export containerboard volume. Volume was essentially flat versus last year. Significant operational and supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefits of a really solid demand backdrop. Our North American packaging business operated with depleted inventories throughout much of 2021, which increased our costs across the system. Across the company, supply chain operating costs increased $170 million or about $0.35 per share, representing more than half of the increase in operations and cost in 2021. The second half of 2021 was especially challenging due to the slow supply chain velocity and very poor logistics reliability, putting additional cost pressure on our manufacturing systems. Maintenance outages increased as planned following deferrals we chose to make in 2020. Input costs rose sharply across just about every category. Cost increased throughout the year with $370 million of higher input costs just in the second half of 2021 resulting in significantly elevated input cost levels exiting 2021. Total corporate expenses decreased by $0.29 per share. Interest expense decreased by $0.21 per share benefiting from significant debt reduction. Tax expense was lower by $0.17 per share with an effective tax rate of 19% as compared to 25% in 2020. These benefits were partially offset by higher corporate costs following the recent spin-off as expected. And lastly equity earnings improved by $0.57 per share. Ilim equity earnings increased by $0.66 while equity earnings from Graphic Packaging decreased by $0.09. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on slide 7. Fourth quarter operating earnings per share were $0.78 as compared to $1.10 in the third quarter. Price and mix improved by $0.22 per share with strong price realization in our North American packaging business, partially offset by mix associated with labor challenges in our US box system. Volume improved less than we anticipated, primarily due to the significant Omicron-related labor and supply chain constraints late in the fourth quarter, especially in the US box system. Many of our suppliers, customers and logistics providers, have also reported labor impacts due to the ongoing COVID resurgence. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, fluff demand is solid. However, vessel delays worsened in the fourth quarter and limited our volume potential. Operations and costs were a headwind in the quarter. The cost impact in the fourth quarter from the tank failure at the Prattville mill was less than we anticipated due to timing. Additionally, we received $40 million of insurance proceeds for Prattville. Operating and distribution costs were impacted by poor reliability from logistics providers across every mode of transportation. Maintenance costs increased sequentially as planned. Input costs increased by $0.22 per share or about $110 million with energy, fiber and chemicals rising in the fourth quarter. Corporate expenses and taxes increased sequentially and interest expense decreased. Ilim equity earnings were lower sequentially partly due to supply chain limitations resulting from increased health measures on rail shipments to China. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on slide 8. In North America demand in the fourth quarter was solid across all our accounts including boxes, sheets and containerboard. However, Omicron intensified supply chain and labor constraints in the later part of the quarter which impacted box volume. The labor impact from Omicron across the value chain is substantial and continues into January, with labor constraints impacting our box plants, suppliers, customers and logistics providers. We're very proud of the IP team and their continued resilience and ability to adapt almost on a daily basis to deliver for our customers. We're experiencing very stretched supply chains and poor carrier reliability across just about every mode of transportation, which put significant strain on our shipments and cost pressure on our mills and box plants. Our mill-to-box plant velocity for containerboard is running three to four days longer than our normalized flow and in some lanes even longer. The lost production of Prattville in the fourth quarter further stressed our network and operating cost. Production at the other mills in our system was 100%. Looking at the fourth quarter performance, price and mix was strong, with very good progress on price realization of our August increase. This was partly offset by a weaker mix related to higher export shipments in the fourth quarter as expected. Volume improved by $20 million sequentially on strong seasonal demand in North America and EMEA, despite three fewer shipping days. As mentioned earlier, box shipments in North America were impacted by supply chain and labor constraints, especially in the latter part of the quarter due to the COVID Omicron variant. Operations and costs were a headwind. Operating and distribution costs in our mills and box plants increased. We operated with very lean containerboard inventories and higher distribution costs throughout most of the fourth quarter to compensate for lost production at Prattville mill. The cost impact of Prattville in the fourth quarter was about $40 million, and we did receive $40 million in insurance in late December. We are currently in the process of restarting the second Prattville machine and expect additional costs in the first quarter. Input costs increased by $90 million in the quarter. Energy accounted for $40 million of that total including $15 million in Europe, where energy prices rose to historically high levels. Wood and OCC accounted for another $35 million, despite modest relief in OCC cost in the latter part of the fourth quarter. Wood fiber costs rose sharply in the third and fourth quarters due to the challenging operating conditions, especially in Southern regions as well as inbound transportation constraints. We expect difficult operating conditions and elevated costs in the first quarter. Let me turn to Slide 9. Earlier in the month, we announced plans to build a new corrugated box plant in Eastern Pennsylvania. The new box plant will complement our Northeast box plant network and support the customers' growth across multiple customer sites. We expect the new plant to start early 2023 and deliver returns of about 20%. We plan to further invest in our US box system to build our needed capabilities and capacity. Investing in our US box system is one of the elements of building a better IP to accelerate profitable growth in our most attractive business. We have some regions where we are limited on box capacity. We have plans to increase capital investments at existing plants as well as invest in new box plants in the next few years. We will ensure we have the right capabilities and capacity to grow earnings and cash. Moving to Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10, I'll start with a few comments on our performance in 2021. We made progress on our commercial initiatives with price mix and volume, contributing about $450 million of improvement. Demand for fluff pulp was solid throughout the year. However, the operating and supply chain environment was extremely challenging, which affected shipments and costs. We also experienced distribution and input cost pressure of more than $200 million, with inputs rising in just about every category. For the full year 2021, our earnings improved about $230 million versus 2020 and we expect further improvement in 2022. Taking a look at the fourth quarter, demand for fluff pulp is strong globally and our backlogs are healthy. Looking at our sequential earnings, product mix impacted earnings by about $5 million. Volume decreased by $10 million due to shipment delays. Our shipments continue to be negatively impacted by port congestion and vessel delays, which worsened in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that we export about 90% of our volume in this business. Operations and costs decreased earnings by about $10 million, driven by higher distribution costs, lower energy sales and the non-repeat of nitrogen credit sales in the third quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by a favorable LIFO adjustment of $10 million in the fourth quarter. Planned maintenance outage costs increased sequentially and input costs increased primarily due to higher chemicals and energy costs. Turning to Ilim results on slide 11. The joint venture has delivered equity earnings of $66 million with an EBITDA margin of 39% in the fourth quarter. Volume and costs were impacted by distribution constraints related to COVID health measures on rail shipments to China. Ilim expects these conditions to continue into early February. For the full year, Ilim delivered outstanding earnings performance with adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion and an average margin of 40%. Ilim's strong operational performance and low cost system make it a powerful cash generator. We received dividends of $154 million in 2021 and expect to receive about $200 million of dividends in 2022. Turning to slide 12. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2021 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper in 2022. Let's start with the balance sheet. We will maintain a strong balance sheet and investment -- credit -- an investment-grade credit rating. As we've said previously, we're comfortable taking our leverage below our target range of 2.5 times to 2.8 times debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. We reduced debt by $2.5 billion in 2021 and more than $4 billion over the last two years. Looking ahead, we have limited near-term maturities with about $900 million due over the next five years. Taking a look at pension, we're very pleased with the performance of our plan. Our qualified pension plan is fully funded with a surplus of about $600 million at year-end. We feel really good about the actions that we've taken to improve performance and derisk the plan. All-in, we closed 2021 with a leverage of 2.5 times on a Moody's basis. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2021, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And over the past five years, we've returned $6 billion to shareholders or about 63% of free cash flow. Looking ahead we're committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. With regard to share repurchases, as of the end of 2021, we had $2.9 billion of available authorizations. We will continue to execute on these authorizations in a manner that balances the investment needs of the business and maximizes value for our shareholders. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash. CapEx in 2021 was $550 million, which was less than we planned due to the timing of equipment delivery and a challenging contract labor environment. Turning to 2022, we are targeting capital spending of $1.1 billion. The planned increase is primarily for strategic projects in our packaging business to build out capabilities and capacity in our box system to drive profitable growth. We also plan to increase funding for cost reduction projects with expected returns in excess of 25%. We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging businesses in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must create compelling value for our shareholders. If we turn to slide 13, before we get into the details of our outlook, let me frame up how we're thinking about this year. First and foremost, we're confident in our ability to grow earnings in 2022, and we project our full year EBITDA to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. Having said that, we expect first quarter earnings to be impacted by a very challenging operating condition and related to the Omicron variant and our highest maintenance outage quarter. As we said earlier, Omicron intensified supply chain and labor constraints in December, which impacted volume and cost. That impact intensified in January as cases increased impacting our workforce, suppliers, customers and logistics providers. Our assumption is that conditions will begin to improve late in the first quarter as Omicron cases begin to subside. Looking at the full year, we expect a solid demand environment for corrugated packaging and pulp with demand growth normalizing as we recover from the near-term Omicron constraints. We're also making good progress on our Building a Better IP set of initiatives which ramp up as the year progresses. Lastly, we are positioned to optimize our mill and box plants from the various disruptions of 2021 which will further improve our operating and distribution costs. We understand the challenges of the first quarter and how we will navigate these near-term headwinds to ensure the company delivers on our full year outlook. So if we turn to Slide 14, we'll take a look at the first quarter. Given the heightened level of near-term noise the first quarter outlook we provide a range of those items where the timing of Omicron recovery presents greater uncertainty. So we'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $65 million on the realization of our August 2021 price increase. Volume is expected to decrease by $15 million to $35 million with a gradual recovery in the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to decrease by $60 million to $75 million which includes additional costs related to Prattville. Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $118 million. The first quarter will be our highest outage quarter this year representing about 40% of total planned outage costs in 2022. First quarter maintenance expense includes the Riverdale printing papers machine. This cost will be fully recovered as part of the transfer price to Sylvamo over the course of the year. Lastly, input costs are expected to decrease by $30 million to $40 million. In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be stable. We expect volume to decrease by $5 million due to ongoing vessel delays. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $45 million related to the higher seasonal cost and non-repeat of LIFO benefits in the fourth quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $11 million. The first quarter will be our highest maintenance outage quarter this year also representing about 40% of total planned outages in 2022. First quarter maintenance expense includes Georgetown printing business. This cost will be fully recovered as part of the transfer price to Sylvamo over the course of the year. Lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $5 million mostly due to higher energy costs. Moving to our full year outlook on Slide 15. We are projecting full year 2022 EBITDA for the company of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. I would note that our outlook only includes the impact from previously published price increases. Free cash flow is expected to be $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And as a reminder our 2021 free cash flow included about $300 million generated by the Printing Papers business which was part of International Paper through the third quarter. We are targeting CapEx of $1.1 billion with increased investments in our US box systems. Our free cash flow projection also includes about $100 million of cash used for the execution of our Build a Better IP set of initiatives, as well as $60 million of payroll taxes related to the CARES Act. Lastly the slide includes our outlook for corporate items and our expected tax rate of 25%. With that I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim for all the details and for walking us through the key earnings drivers. As we look ahead, I am very confident in our ability to grow our earnings in 2022. We anticipate a solid demand growth environment. We're positioned to operate with a fully optimized mill and box plant system as we exit the first quarter and our team is laser-focused on delivering $200 million to $225 million from our Build a Better IP initiative. We have a clear plan and we have a team in place to make it happen. With that operator, we're ready to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, Mark and Tim. I hope you and your family are well. I had a question. I know it's probably an oversimplification. But when I think about your North American corrugated business, we don't yet know obviously industry data, but US box shipment is down 3.3%. Can you talk about how much of that is missed opportunity and perhaps the market itself is still growing versus maybe some customers that are having to go to competing suppliers. And relatedly, to the extent I guess you can comment and that's true, what you may have to do to kind of re-earn that business. I suspect it's better on-time delivery the service et cetera. But just if you could expand on that a little bit? Mark Sutton : Yes I think that's a great question Gabe. The results we posted in the fourth quarter, so I don't know what the market will be, but half of our sort of gap to what we think the market was like just given our participation rate in all the segments was really due to the -- our inability to service demand that was there related to the gyrations caused by the lack of containerboard from Prattville. And so, just practically speaking, what that means is we've got to source that board from another mill and it just so happens some of those other mills are in the most rail congested shipping lines. So getting it to the box plants in time to meet the order expectation by the customer was compromised. It's a different version of the same thing we struggled with after the winter storm and freeze earlier in the year, which took a number of -- took 150,000 tons offline for us just based on the geography of our plants. And the other half of what we think we missed relative to where the market might be is really just our own impact in our company and in our supply chain partners with labor around Omicron. Now, the good news, if there is good news in all of that is as we look at our key targeted customers and the customers we have large positions with, it doesn't appear that we're losing any share. What we have not been able to do and it's been consistent really since the second quarter, third -- the second quarter, when we were coming out of these production disruptions, we have not been able to enjoy some of the incremental growth. Everybody in the industry has been running relatively full out. So finding replacement packaging, if you don't have incremental capacity coming online, I think has been a challenge for a lot of customers. So, lack of ability to take advantage of incremental growth, so far has been where the damage has been limited to. And we're ready to be able to be in a position post the first quarter, when Prattville is fully back online, a big chunk of these outages are behind us. And our system can be optimized again, where we're shipping from the correct mill to the correct set of box plants, our costs will go down as well. And we should be in very good shape to take advantage of what the market has. Gabe Hajde : All right. Thank you for that, Mark. So I guess it's fair to say that, Q1 is kind of a trough for the company overall. And then obviously second half will be much stronger. And then I guess, my other question was, where will we see benefits from Build a Better IP? Is that going to show up in operations? As you presented, I guess in your earnings bridges that's sort of what I'm more curious. And then, the cadence of that over the course of this year and again don't take this the wrong way, but it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot showing up in Q1. Tim Nicholls : Yes. And we'll report out in Q1, when we get to the end of the quarter. So, it will show up mostly in cost. Now we do have -- as we go into next year, we do have growth initiatives that we believe will begin ramping up. But early on, it's going to be in a couple of places. One, just rebalancing for the stranded costs that we have from Sylvamo. We shared a slide I believe last quarter that showed that we have just under $100 million of costs that we will overcome as we go through this year. And then the other place where there's significant opportunity that we will see ramp up as we go through the year and these are things that we've been working on for 12-plus months is around process optimization. And a lot of that has to do with how we source inputs in our global sourcing organization. There's some supply chain impact. And in our Industrial Packaging business, there's actually a lot of advanced technology projects that are being deployed for allowing us to operate slightly differently and make better operating decisions real-time in the moment. And so we had targeted the $200 million to $225 million for this year gross which will overcome and then some the $100 million that we have in stranded cost. And we'll be -- as we go to the first quarter we'll start sharing quarterly updates and we'll do that throughout the year. Gabe Hajde : Thank you gentlemen. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Just on the Global Fibers side, I wanted to clarify I think you indicated you expected earnings to be higher in 2022 than in 2021. And you've also indicated when you're providing your outlook for 2022 that you weren't including any price increases that haven't been published. So, I just want to confirm that that statement also didn't include the latest round of increases that you've announced on fluff pulp. And then to fill it in given obviously based on the guidance Q1 is starting pretty deep in the hole. What is it that's going to drive this superior or this improved earnings in 2022 over 2021 because it would seem to be something beyond at least the types of published prices that we tend to see? Mark Stephan : So, Mark you're correct on the first two points. Those price increases are not in the commentary or not considered in the full year outlook. And I think what we're looking at in the first quarter we outlined -- Tim outlined additional maintenance. So, in past years, a lot of that was done in the second quarter. So, what we got is a strong demand environment. We got the full year benefit of the prior published price increases which I'm sure you're modeling correctly. We have the $200 million to $225 million of initiatives that are part of our reimagined Building a Better IP. And very, very importantly which we haven't had really since the second quarter of last year we should enter the second quarter of this year with our mill our containerboard mill system and our containerboard box system back in balance. So, that means not paying premium freight because we're shipping off of our contractual rates we're shipping from the wrong geography. All of the things we've been struggling with that have disproportionately probably added cost to our company beyond just the general inflation in the market goes away. So, a well-organized back to our normal supply chain configuration for three quarters of the year we feel really good about being able to put the first quarter in perspective. And again what Tim walked you through was a range because we are trying our best to be realistic about how long the disruptions related to Omicron last for us and our supply chain partners. I hope we're wrong and I hope it goes back to full staffing and all that sooner. But we're just trying to be as transparent as we can. But we believe we're going to be set up, especially because the company would be optimized again for the remainder of the year. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. And so that would be true on the Cellulose because I guess the question was really just to make sure I heard right that you expected global cellulose to be higher and so it's also better positioning? I guess I was trying to understand whether some of the commercial initiatives that you've talked about are also an important part of the Global Cellulose Fibers improvement you're expecting in 2022. Mark Stephan : So, Mark almost all of the improvement in Global Cellulose Fibers in 2021 and into 2022 has been the commercial changes we're making and continue to make to the business. Without going into a lot of detail, the business is mostly absorbent pulp and of the absorbent pulp, there are three types of channels, sort of, what might be called spot or month-to-month there is long-term volume-based contractual and then there are some other configurations. Each of those has a different pace of changing commercial terms how fast prices go through. We'll have the full year of this pricing environment. We're making changes. You can see it in some of the data around fluff pulp versus others. And when we get to the second half of the year I mean typically we've had one quarter which is a low maintenance outage quarter where the business produces 20%-plus margins and cost of capital returns. We should see that in the entire second half of the year. And then as we go into 2023 we should start to see that for three out of four quarters. And then we're going to have a business where I said we would get it which is value-creating throughout a full year. And a big portion of that is driven by the commercial changes. After or not after but as we get through the commercial changes we'll begin to make some of the investments necessary to structurally reduce the cost to make the product primarily in the legacy IP mills where our cost structure is reflective of those mills being converted mills and not built for purpose. So it's moving in the right direction. The commercial changes we're making are working and the business will be profitable this year. It will be better than last year and it will be around the cost of capital for the final two quarters of the year. Mark Weintraub : Great. I will get back in queue for another question if there is time. Thank you. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please state your question. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Congratulations on all the efforts and progress this year. I guess, my first question is kind of joined at the hip around the box business. Mark, can you talk a little bit about what kind of shipments or bookings you're seeing early in the quarter or at least from a market standpoint if not for IP? And then when we look at Pennsylvania and the investments that you're making there you talked about 20% returns when you're done with the project. Do you have similar abilities with other box plant projects to get that kind of return? And then I had a quick follow-on. Mark Sutton : Yes. So the January is very difficult to get any visibility to because what we've got is a fair amount of demand and orders, but the inability to get it made or get it shipped or for our customers to accept it. So I don't know how to give you a real focus on January. What we are hearing though is that our end customer demand is not dissipating at all. So I think what's going to happen is demand will be -- shipments will be choppy in January and probably most of February. If this virus curve tracks like it looks like it's tracking I think there'll be a tremendous amount of inventory replenishment activity starting in March and the quarter -- it will come out in the quarter. But January is very choppy just because of the hitting this ability for us to get -- most of it is labor related for us to get boxes made. If we have them made getting them shipped and for our customers especially some of the large customers to be able to accept the shipments because they're running at a reduced rate. The second part of your question, can you repeat it George? George Staphos : Yes, Mark just on \u2013 yes, no worries at all. The Pennsylvania box plant and the returns that you're targeting there, can you replicate that kind of return with other box plant investments that you have in your investment horizon over the next couple of years? And sort of my follow-on question and I'll hand it over here. There does seem to be a fair amount of box plant capacity coming into the Pennsylvania-Delaware region. Does that give you any pause relative to your investment? And when we think about the European business where the returns have been probably below expectations the last couple of years how do you see that improving and fitting strategically within IP? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. Yes, the box plant question we do have other opportunities. There could be somewhere between three to five box plants geographically placed with the same set of economics of a market area where we are low on capacity and a customer list that wants to buy more from us and it's fully integrated with our mill system. That gives you a return in the 17% to 22%. So we think we've got several more 20% opportunities for new box plants and we've got many opportunities as I mentioned on our last call and at the last conference I spoke at that we have to put additional equipment inside of existing plants that have the physical room and space and are in the right market geographies. So when Tim talked about capital, expenditures moving up, most of that is for converting capability and capacity throughout the US box system. On the Europe question, the Europe returns are moving up. I think again, we got to look at the moment of extraordinarily high energy cost. Natural gas is at all-time highs. We don't think that will stay that way. We've got the normal lag in recovery of containerboard prices going up against box prices. That usually takes a couple of quarters. When you look at normalized energy, when you look at the value of integration from these small acquisitions we've made, the business is at a value-creating return level in the not-too-distant future. So with one large mill and it being 100% on purchased power because it's recycled, that natural gas phenomenon, if you're following it in Europe is a huge blow to the profitability. But it's a moment in time. It's not a \u2013 we don't believe it's a permanent issue. George Staphos : Thank you very much. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. In containerboard, can you talk a little bit more about your inventory levels? It seems like from industry data, mill inventories are somewhat elevated versus history. But some of your competitors have flagged box plant inventories as quite lean. Just wondering with all the moving pieces in Prattville, how you think about your inventories and kind of getting back into balance? Mark Sutton : Yes, it's a great question, Anthony. I think the inventory \u2013 this is the IP perspective and it may be what others are saying as well, the absolute number is less important right now versus where it is and how fast or slow the supply chain is moving. So we have struggled with having not enough inventory, regardless of what the absolute number might be to really take advantage of sourcing our box plants with board through most of 2021. It started back in February, March and we never really were able to catch up because demand kept accelerating. So we think we've got inventory as we enter 2022 in a much better position. It's not all in the right place. Our experience is also that our box plants still don't have everything they need. The paper is made, it's sitting at a mill in a warehouse and we're waiting for railcars to get switched to a specific mill. We have several mills below a certain rail line that kind of joins up in Birmingham. South and East of that is the biggest choke point in the country right now. So moving our containerboard into our box network has been just a random occurrence almost every day. So our inventories are better but I measure it as can we fund the box plants with the board they need at the moment that they need it. And we're still not where we want to be on that. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a question for Tim. On Ilim, the ruble has plunged I think to multiyear lows. And obviously, there's some geopolitical uncertainty there. How does that impact, how does the Ilim ruble impact what Ilim might report in 1Q? And then is there any operational impact or potential future operational impact if tensions worsen, or just any thoughts there? Tim Nicholls : Yes. It's really hard to speculate on that scenario or what might happen or how the US government might respond. I think the good news is from a currency standpoint, there is very little exposure from currency movement to the debt position. They hold a lot of debt in rubles. And so they're somewhat insulated from maybe what we would have seen in prior periods. And we also referenced in the speaker comments about the dividend and that dividend is paid out of the entity in Switzerland, where they manage all of their export sales. And currently, it's viewed that there is sufficient cash in that entity to be able to pay the dividend, unless there's some other type of restrictions. So we feel pretty good about Ilim, their position and especially, how they're running the business. But from a financial standpoint, they seem to be in pretty good shape. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Paul Quinn : Yeah. Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a question on Global Cellulose Fibers. I see some price increases in the marketplace and I understand your guidance doesn't reflect those recent price increases. But just overall, on pricing the spread between fluff and NBSK is at a historical high. If I look back at the last seven years, I mean that spread is less than $40. We're currently at $240. What has caused that? And do you think that's going to hold going forward? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Hey, Paul it's Tim. I think there's a lot of moving pieces but certainly our approach to how we're interacting with customers is part of the strategy that we've talked about commercially. And so we feel good about the steps commercially that the team has taken up to this point. Supply chain could also be providing a little bit of help, just given how much disruption there is and we'll have to see how it plays out as supply chains normalize. But I think the way the team is executing and how they're thinking about their opportunities in the market, relative to segments and geographies is producing the results that we wanted. Paul Quinn : All right. That\u2019s all I had. Best of luck Mark Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO. Please state your question. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. I wondered if you guys could just help reconcile some numbers. I mean if we look at the Pulp and Paper Week open market prices for containerboard they're kind of $800 to $875. If we then look at kind of the data that is out there on estimated mill cash costs, I'm trying to get from those numbers to your segment results because it just -- it seems like there's an enormous gap there. Mark Sutton : Mark, I don't know what numbers you're looking at. I think the issue that we have is our margins in North American Industrial Packaging have been compressed and there's two main reasons for that. Because of the way we've operated since essentially March, we have moved off of our most cost-effective supply chain approach. So we have hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental costs related to running a sub-optimized system. Sub-optimized means making the containerboard and shipping it to the wrong places because we don't have another alternative because other capacity was down. Given the size of our system, given the fact that we make containerboard in the Southeast and ship it to California and all of those things, we have not been able to realize as much of our price realization to the bottom line as we normally would. And so that's been a big portion of margin compression for us. And then when you look at the overall full breadth of our customer and segment mix we have varying degrees of sizes of customers timing of realization. So for example, Tim called out we're still getting $65 million of realization in the first quarter of 2022. That's not for every customer. That's for a group of customers that it takes longer. So I think that's really what you're seeing, if you're probing on margins, which I know you talk about a lot and we work on a lot. That's really the biggest issue. I think when we get to the second quarter and we're back to where we can optimize our network it really works well like a flywheel for us. And then we get margins north of 20% again and it's in the zone of what we would expect. It's been very hard for us to achieve the margin structure that I think most people would expect us to be in when we have operated with the initial 150,000 tons that came offline with the weather events at the beginning of the year and then coupled with the challenges we had through the rest of trying to make sure we put the customers first in many cases. And one way to not have had all of these issues is just to cut off a bunch of business and reset everything which is the wrong thing to do for the long-term. But the good news is most of that is behind us Prattville's coming up as we speak and we should be ready to optimize and regear the company back to the 20 -- the margins north of 20% again, which we would expect to have at this point in this business. Mark Wilde : And I guess Mark, kind of, two just follow-ons to this. The first one is I'm just curious about whether there's maybe the need to rethink some of the bigger volume contracts and how those work for you. And then I'd also like to get a sense when you talk about this 20% return on the Philly area box plant, does that assume market level of transfer price and the 20% return is just the return you can generate at the box plant, or are you assuming some of that is a mill-related benefit? Tim Nicholls : Hey Mark, it's Tim. It has a mill-related benefit in it. We look at this business especially here in North America as being an integrated business. So we're deploying capital in our mill system for the benefit of our converting business. And the value proposition is across the whole supply chain. So we look at integrated returns for the investments that we make. Mark Wilde : Okay. Last one Tim. I just -- we went through this whole exercise about 15 or 20 years ago with box USA and it just seemed like there were a lot of systems benefits that were priced into that deal. And I'm not sure that we ever saw them. Have you gone back and looked at some of these other prior transactions and to see what worked and what has not worked? Tim Nicholls : We do that on a regular basis and constantly trying to learn and make sure that we are seeing if there were opportunities that we missed in one instance that we correct that going forward. So I think we have a fairly robust process of -- and we're fairly critical of ourselves as we should be internally to make process improvements about how we do it. Box USA specifically I haven't looked at in a very long time. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right, I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. Kyle White : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the outlook that you provided, are you able to give a sense of what the midpoint of that guidance range assumes for box shipment growth in 2022? And then what are you assuming from the supply chain and labor challenges in terms of any moderation throughout the year? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. On the box growth, I think what we said in the speaker notes without quantifying but we can talk about historical numbers, we see if we get through this variant that we start normalizing on the demand function to pre-COVID. So we were consistently experiencing 1.5% to 2% growth. How that unfolds over the course of the year is a little bit of a question mark, but that's the expectation at the moment. I'm sorry what was the first part of your question? Mark Sutton : He wants to know the supply chain and labor cost issues, what are we assuming for that for the rest of the year? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Just at a high level, we think we begin normalizing as we get through the first quarter and then we'll have to see how it plays out going to the second quarter. I mean the disruption from Omicron it came on so suddenly and so severely, I think a lot of people were surprised by how quickly it began impacting almost every aspect of the supply chain. And so it started late November early December accelerated. Hopefully we're peaking here in the next few weeks. But I would say that geographically it's not uniform because of the way it's spread. It's going to peak in different places at different times and then fall off. Kyle White : Got it. That's helpful. And then on Prattville it sounds like the Paper Machine one is starting up as we speak. But just curious if you could give us an exact time line of when you expect that machine to restart? And what are the additional costs from that disruption included in the 1Q outlook? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, what we're expecting in the first quarter is that there will be roughly $25 million of additional costs related to the inefficiency of the machine coming back up. And then we won't have the mill fully restored until we get through the outage in the second quarter and then we would expect the mill to be back up and fiber balanced and running at its optimum cost structure. Kyle White : Got it. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I hope you\u2019re well. Tim, one on guidance for you, my obligatory guidance question. So, since the pandemic started you've refrained from providing annual guidance, understandably so. And I know you have a number of portfolio changes which may increase your desire to give a full year number. Otherwise we might be all over the place. But, it seems like the uncertainty is greater than it's ever been in terms of the virus inflation the state of the global economy. You just talked about Russia earlier, demand same. I mean so, I guess what -- how much confidence do you really have in this full year EBITDA range that you've provided? And did you consider just not doing it because of all of these uncertainties that seem to only be getting more pronounced, not less? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. That's a great question, Adam. I mean just a few thoughts for consideration. When we stopped we stopped because no one knew what the pandemic was going to bring. I would argue there was more uncertainty at that moment in time back in 2020 than there is currently. But -- and in 2021 as well. I think if we look at what Omicron has done globally, we see where it started and ramped quickly peaked and then fell off. And so, we used that as a base case for a set of expectations here. There's always going to be things that crop up like you mentioned that is difficult for us to really calibrate on in the moment. But what we have confidence in is what we've been working on for the past 12 to 18 months and how we believe those initiatives are going to come through this year. So, there's the things that we can manage and control, and then there's the impacts externally that we'll just have to deal with. But in terms of how the business we expect to perform, what we're going to see in terms of initiatives falling through to the bottom line, we're very confident in. Mark Sutton : Adam, if I could add to Tim's comments and you mentioned it in the way you phrased the question, one of the reasons we're more confident than we have been is because the portfolio is narrowed. And we now know that the Packaging business and for that matter the Cellulose Fibers business both have performed very well in the environment of a pandemic. And we know what they perform like if we weren't in a pandemic because so much of our packaging goes into essential materials like food. If there's another difficult year with a pandemic, we think the packaging business because of who it provides packaging for, is going to perform very well. We performed very well in the first part of the pandemic. We got our system out of whack in the second year of the pandemic but still grew our earnings and our revenue. And whatever 2022 holds pandemic related, we believe, because of what we make, we're going to have really good opportunities to perform. We think we have the ability depending on where cost go to capture pricing to be able to offset some of that. And what we're not -- what we're going to have in 2022 that we didn't have in 2021 is a more balanced operating system. So, that's about as confident as we can be without knowing the future. Adam Josephson : Sure. No, I understand that Mark. And just one more for you Mark. On the supply/demand, someone asked you this earlier, but all we can see is what the industry data is with respect to inventories operating rate shipments. And appreciating how messed up the supply chain is what are your thoughts about what \"underlying supply/demand\" is such that we can perhaps seize through whatever distortions you think exist in the industry data that would be supportive of rising prices? Mark Sutton : It's -- I just think what I would do if I were you as an analyst, I would try to look at the historical absolutes weeks of supply, whatever number you want to choose. And then I would look -- I would map that against supply chain. There's a few metrics out there around velocity and recognize that operating rates, absolute inventory, supply chain velocity and the pure supply-demand balance. So, against a backdrop of firm demand and companies that knowing IP's case, have cut corners a bit on maintenance because of availability of equipment and just the demand environment last year, we'll be taking facilities down for maintenance which takes supply offline, I would look at that holistically and I would shy away from looking at an absolute inventory number and comparing it to normal times. I just think that leads to the wrong conclusion. Adam Josephson : Got it. I really appreciate, Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Adam. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please state your question. Phil Ng : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, certainly, a big step up in CapEx this year, but should we expect that to stay pretty elevated in 2023 with some of the box plant opportunity you referred to? And how should we think about normalized CapEx with your slimmed down portfolio now? Tim Nicholls : I think normalized. So with the new portfolio, we're at about $1.1 billion of depreciation. And so we're in line with that for 2022. I think we should be close to that in future years. There may be times when we're slightly above, but it will be above for very distinguishable strategic opportunities that we can highlight. Phil Ng : Okay. Got you. And then Tim you talked about this a little bit about the financial impact on the ruble and how you guys are positioned. But any color on even some of the political unrest in that region and COVID shutdown in China? Have you seen any choppiness in order activity in your operations whether it's Ilim or any impact on your Cellulose Fibers segment? Tim Nicholls : No, not really. It's mostly supply chain related due to COVID and all of the disruptions that we've seen as we've gone through the past year. Yes, we haven't noticed anything outside of that at this point. Phil Ng : All right. Thanks a lot guys. Tim Nicholls : Yes. Operator : I would now like to turn the floor back to CEO, Mark Sutton for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Sutton : Thank you. What I'd like to do is just reiterate that we're confident in our ability to execute for the remainder of 2022. We've got a solid demand environment. We've got the full year benefit of the pricing that we've already implemented flowing through for the full year. We highlighted the $200-plus million of benefits associated with building a better IP. We will have very importantly the biggest part of our company optimized again for the majority of 2022 that being our mill and box plant system. And very importantly, our balance sheet's in the best shape that we've been in a very long time. All the capital allocation levers are available to us and we plan to invest smartly in our US box system over the next few years to grow profitably. So, thank you for your interest in International Paper. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in International Paper's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. You go ahead, sir. Guillermo Gutierrez : Thank you, Charm. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers.  For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is also available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our first quarter 2022 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International Paper's first quarter earnings were better than we had outlooked, driven by strong price realization and solid operations to overcome significantly higher input costs, especially for energy, chemicals and distribution. We also delivered strong cash from operations.  We delivered strong year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in the first quarter, driven by price realization from prior increases in our 2 business segments. Omicron-related constraints impacted volume in our Packaging business in January. Our shipments recovered as expected throughout the quarter with demand normalizing at elevated levels as we enter into the second quarter. Our mills and converting system performed well as we managed through continued logistics constraints, which negatively impacted operating. We executed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year very well, and we expect to complete about 70% of our planned maintenance in the first half of the year. We achieved $40 million of earnings through our Building a Better IP initiatives, and we are confident in our full year target of $200 million to $225 million of gross incremental earnings in 2022. We are excited by the opportunities we have to materially lower our cost structure and to accelerate profitable growth. Later on in our presentation, Tim will walk you through our first quarter progress.  On capital allocation, in the first quarter, we returned $580 million to shareowners, including $406 million of share repurchases. This highlights the choices that our strong balance sheet and cash generation provide for us.  Before we continue, I'd like to share some perspective on something that's top of mind. First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine. The stories, images and reports coming out of the country continue to be both tragic and troubling. Many of our own employees, especially those in Europe, have friends and family who are directly affected. As a way to help all the people impacted, we have continued to donate to support humanitarian relief efforts.  With respect to our Ilim joint venture, we announced last month that we were exploring options, including selling our 50% interest. We are pursuing the completion of this work with urgency from engaging external advisers to having discussions with interested parties. The complexity of our JV structure may impact the pace of reaching a resolution, but it will not affect the urgency of our efforts or our commitments to resolve the situation in a responsible way. As we move through this process, we will continue to comply with all regulations and sanctions, and we will update our stakeholders when there is more information to share.  Turning to first quarter results on Slide 4. Revenue increased by 14% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization in our 2 business segments. Operating earnings per share improved by just over 50% versus last year and we generated strong cash from operations. Margins in the first quarter were impacted by higher input costs and the execution of our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year.  We do expect margins to expand in the second quarter, with further expansion in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces higher input costs and as we step down from higher maintenance outage quarters later in the year.  I will now turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our outlook. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mark. I'm on Slide 5, which shows our sequential earnings bridge. First quarter operating earnings per share were $0.76 as compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter. Price and mix improved by about $131 million or $0.27 per share, with strong price realization in both business segments and across all of our channels. Volume was slightly lower as expected due to seasonally lower demand in North America and the impact of Omicron in the early part of the first quarter. In Global Cellulose Fibers, fluff pulp shipments were constrained by the ongoing vessel delays. Operations and costs were an $0.08 headwind in the quarter. Our mills and converting system performed well and we made excellent progress normalizing containerboard inventories across our network. We received $20 million of insurance recovery or about $0.04 per share related to Prattville. In Global Cellulose Fibers, ongoing logistics constraints impacted operating costs by about $25 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter. We successfully completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. These costs were in line with our outlook. And we expect to complete nearly 70% of our annual maintenance program in the first half of the year. Input costs rose sharply in the latter part of the first quarter, driven by higher energy, chemicals and distribution costs, mostly due to higher diesel fuel prices. These costs more than offset moderately lower recovered fiber costs. On Slide 32 of the appendix, we provide details on our consumption of key inputs, including natural gas, which was a significant cost headwind in the quarter.  Moving to corporate expense. We improved by $0.05 per share sequentially. Lower corporate S&A was partly offset by higher tax. Corporate expenses also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count. Lastly, equity earnings improved sequentially. I'd also note that in the first quarter, we received the dividend from Ilim as expected.  Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. In North America, demand normalized in February and March as expected, following the labor impact from Omicron in the early part of the first quarter. Overall box demand in North America is stable as we enter the second quarter. Our mills and converting system performed well, and we replenished system inventories, which puts us in a much better position to optimize our cost as we navigate continued logistics constraints and poor carrier reliability.  Looking at first quarter performance. Price and mix was strong, driven by realization of our August price increase. Volume was lower sequentially due to slower seasonal demand and Omicron labor constraints in the early part of the first quarter. To put the Omicron impact into context, our January volume was down nearly double digits. As expected, our volume normalized at elevated levels following a very challenging January.  Volume across our U.S. channels continue to perform well. As a reminder, our U.S. channel include our U.S. box system, our open market containerboard customers and our equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders. Operations and costs improved sequentially with overall performance significantly better than expected.  As I mentioned, our mills and converting system performed well, and we made good progress normalizing our system inventories. Operating costs remain elevated due to ongoing logistics constraints. However, we are in a much better position to navigate this environment with healthier system inventories. I would also note that operational cost includes $20 million of insurance recovery in the first quarter related to Prattville, which follows $40 million of insurance recovery we received in the fourth quarter.  We successfully completed our highest maintenance outage of the quarter and expect to incur nearly 70% of outage costs in the first half of the year. Lastly, input costs were a significant headwind in the first quarter relative to our expectations. In the latter part of the quarter, we experienced sharply higher costs for chemicals, energy and distribution. We anticipate these higher costs to persist in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 7. As we look ahead in our North American Industrial Packaging business, we are making good progress restoring margins to our historical low 20% range. And we fully anticipate margins to expand in the second quarter and step up further in the second half of the year.  In the second quarter, we expect further benefits from the run rate of our August 2021 price increase as well as the initial benefits from our March 2022 price increase with further realization in the second half of the year. Our price realization is expected to outpace higher costs for energy, chemicals and distribution as we move through the second quarter and into the second half of the year. Operationally, we've recovered from the system disruptions that affected us last year. Our mills and converting systems are performing well and labor across our box network continues to improve. Containerboard inventories across our system are back to normalized levels, which helps us proactively manage ongoing rail and truck constraints. And as mentioned, we will step down from the highest maintenance outage quarters. All of this gives us confidence in our path to restore margins as we move through the second quarter and into the second half of 2022. Moving on to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. I'll start with a few comments on the demand environment and supply chain. We feel really good about the resiliency of demand for fluff pulp. Our confidence reflects the essential role of absorbent hygiene products for consumers. In addition, we expect the supply-demand environment for fluff to remain relative -- to remain highly favorable. Feedback from our customers indicates that fluff pulp inventories are at historic lows. This is partly due to significantly stretched supply chains. To put this into context, schedule reliability for ocean vessels, which typically ranges from 70% to 80%, is currently running at 30% to 40%. Additionally, the average vessel delay that was historically 1 day is now 5 days. We expect these challenging conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. Taking a look at first quarter performance. Price and mix improved by $17 million. I would note that the pace of price realization from our prior price increases is impacted by ongoing shipping delays. As a reminder, we export 80% to 90% of our pulp production with price realization typically achieved when the vessel sailed.  Volume in the quarter was stable. I would note that backlogs are about double our normalized levels due to the logistics challenges. Our mills ran well. However, operations and costs were a $45 million headwind in the quarter, with more than half of the unfavorable impact due to ongoing logistics challenges.  Higher seasonal costs related to energy consumption represented an additional $10 million headwind in the quarter. We also successfully completed the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. And lastly, input costs increased by $50 million, sequentially split about evenly between wood, chemicals and energy.  Turning to Slide 9. Taking a closer look at our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we are well positioned to deliver cost of capital returns in the third and fourth quarters of this year. As I said earlier, we have a favorable demand-supply outlook for fluff pulp, with price realization from prior increases accelerating as we move through the year. Again, keep in mind that price realization in this business lags about 2 to 3 quarters. I would also note that we are making solid progress in our fluff pulp contract negotiations, which will provide additional commercial benefits as we move into 2023.  So now I'll turn to Slide 10 and our outlook for the second quarter. Starting with Industrial Packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $75 million on realization of prior increases. Volume is expected to increase by $35 million on seasonally stronger demand. I would note that there is 1 less day sequentially. As we said earlier, volume is stable at elevated levels as we enter the second quarter. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million, driven mostly by lower sequential Prattville insurance recovery.  Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $60 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $50 million. Again, this is driven by higher energy, chemicals and distribution costs, mostly due to higher diesel fuel prices. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to improve by $50 million on realization of prior increases.  As a reminder, price realization in this segment has a 2- to 3-quarter lag. We're running on the longer end of that range right now due to the ongoing vessel delays. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million, driven by logistics constraints. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $26 million. And again, lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $20 million, driven by higher energy, chemicals and distribution.  Turning to the full year outlook on Slide 11. We're confident in our full year EBITDA outlook of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. Input costs for energy, chemicals and distribution rose sharply in the latter part of the first quarter. We successfully mitigated the impact and delivered earnings that were better than our outlook in the first quarter. Demand for corrugated packaging normalized at elevated levels following Omicron. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we see a favorable supply-demand backdrop for fluff pulp.  As we look ahead, we began to realize our March 2022 price increase in our North American Packaging business. Additionally, we anticipate margin recovery in our EMEA packaging businesses as box price begins to offset the higher energy and containerboard costs. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price realization to accelerate in the second quarter. All in, we anticipate margin expansion in the second quarter, with further acceleration in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces higher input costs. We will also step down from the highest maintenance outage quarters of the year with nearly 70% of our maintenance program completed in the first half.  We are also confident in achieving $200 million to $225 million of gross earnings from our Build a Better IP initiatives. As I said earlier, we are confident in returning to 20%-plus margins in our packaging business and delivering cost of capital returns in our Cellulose Fibers business in the second half of the year. On Slide 12, I'll take a moment to update you on capital allocation actions in the first quarter. Starting with the balance sheet. As I said last quarter, we're very pleased with the progress we've made to strengthen our balance sheet. As a reminder, we reduced debt by $2.5 billion in 2021 and more than $4 billion over the past few years. With these actions, our 2021 year-end leverage was 2.3x on a Moody's basis, which is below our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. And looking ahead, we have limited near-term maturities with about $900 million due over the next 5 years.  Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the first quarter, we returned $580 million to shareowners, including $406 million through share repurchases, which represents 8.9 million shares or about 2.4% of shares outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, we had $2.5 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization.  Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We're targeting CapEx of $1.1 billion this year, which includes funding for strategic projects in our Packaging business, to build out capabilities and capacity of the box system to drive profitable growth.  We also plan to increase funding for cost reduction projects with expected returns on those projects in excess of 25%. We will continue to be disciplined and selective when assessing M&A opportunities that may supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our Packaging businesses in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must create compelling value for our shareholders. One final comment on capital allocation. Last week, we monetized about half of our investment in Sylvamo with proceeds of $144 million. This reduces our ownership interest to about 10.5%.  Turning to Slide 13, I'll provide further detail on the work that we're doing around Building a Better IP. As you can see on the right side of the slide, we are also introducing a chart that will highlight our progress each quarter. We're confident in our Build a Better IP set of initiatives, which will deliver more than $200 million of gross incremental earnings in 2022. That represents more than 2x the dis-synergies resulting from the spin-off.  And our value drivers continue to ramp in 2023 and 2024, with net incremental earnings of $350 million to $430 million in 2024. Through the first quarter, we achieved $40 million of earnings improvement from dedicated teams working on more than 50 initiatives across the company. Approximately 70% of these initial results are coming from structural cost reductions. By streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with our more simplified portfolio, we have already offset 100% of the dis-synergies from the Sylvamo spin. And we have line of sight to additional savings from initiatives targeting lower overhead spending and further optimization. We are designing the organization to support a packaging-focused company with a more focused footprint, which is what lean effectiveness is all about.  Taking a closer look at the other 2 drivers. We believe our process optimization initiative has potential to significantly reduce costs across our operations by leveraging advanced technology and data analytics. Over the past year, dedicated teams have been working with outside experts to identify opportunities and develop new tools and capabilities to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing. We believe these opportunities are significant and we will begin scaling these capabilities across our system.  And finally, strategy acceleration is about delivering profitable growth through commercial and investment excellence. We are focused on profitably growing our North American box channel and optimizing our EMEA Packaging business through organic growth and targeted capital investments. We are also committed to delivering cost of capital financial returns in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Through the first quarter, we have structurally improved margins in our GCF business by realizing more value for absorbent pulp through restructuring commercial contracts, and we're growing our specialty products through innovation.  We've also realized benefits from mix improvements in our North American Packaging business and further optimization of our European operations by improving performance and increasing integration of our Madrid mill and box system. As I mentioned earlier, there are dedicated teams working on many initiatives across the company that will drive structural earnings growth going forward.  We have good line of sight on the expected benefits for 2022 and beyond, and we'll continue to update you on our results going forward. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. This is an exciting time for International Paper. Our team is focused on Building a Better IP and accelerating performance. And while I'm mindful that there are real concerns on the macro environment, I'm very optimistic about the path we're charting to accelerate value creation, and let me share a few of the reasons why I'm optimistic.  First, I'm confident in our earnings outlook for the year and our ability to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022. Additionally, our focused portfolio and narrower geographic footprint has enabled our teams to focus on building a better IP. This is the first quarter in which we reported the earnings benefits from these initiatives. I'm very pleased with our progress and our momentum. We're on track to deliver $200 million to $225 million of incremental gross earnings this year.  And lastly, during the past few years, we have significantly enhanced our financial strength. We view this as foundational because it enables the execution of our capital allocation framework, which has a clear objective to accelerate value creation for our shareowners. We have a clear path and the team to make it happen.  Before we move to the question-and-answer segment, let me express my appreciation to Guillermo Gutierrez for his work heading up Investor Relations. Guillermo is moving to a new leadership role as Vice President and General Manager, leading our Latin American Packaging business. Mark Nelson has been named the new Vice President of Investor Relations. Mark has been with International Paper for 30 years and has served in leadership roles in finance and in general management. This transition is underway. So once again, many thanks to you, Guillermo.  With that, operator, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : Congratulations on the progress on the operations. My 2 questions are centered around the box business. So Mark, you talked a lot about, understandably, improving the packaging focus of the business and the capabilities on converting and we understand that.  What are you doing on the sales and marketing side, the feet on the street to be able to leverage that increased capability both in terms of volume and ultimately in terms of margin? What are you doing in terms of changes in incentives, people you're adding? And then I had a follow-on. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. Yes, it's two parts. One is making sure we have our production system well aligned and we struggled a bit last year. That's in much better shape, so our sales and marketing allowed to secure business. And the second piece is, as you mentioned, making sure we align the incentives with margin improvement, the right customer mix. So there's different objectives for different parts of the sales force around growing new business in new segments, and others have a different set of objectives around growing in existing accounts.  We have an active mix and margin improvement team. Some of the data analytics that Tim mentioned are really centered around really understanding the full answer to the question, how and where do we make the most money? When you think about converting, you have hours of productive machine time to sell to the market. Optimizing the use of that time across the right customers and segments and then making sure, of course, you're pricing for value, all of that is actively part of what we're refreshing and improving.  I think the #1 thing we need for our sales force is the investment in our converting operations so that we have the capacity in the right geography of where the actual demand is. And we're making improvement on that. That will continue for as far as you can see. George Staphos : Okay. And then the follow-on, when we look at your slides this quarter versus last quarter and also reflect back on some of the commentary earlier in the quarter, we seem to recall that you had expected box volumes to be up in the quarter. Now maybe that was a channel comment, maybe it was a box comment, but in either case, volumes were down a bit. And at the same time, your price mix, looking at what you reported versus what your guidance was last quarter, was actually better. I think you got $114 million in the slide as you presented them. I think the commentary last quarter for looking out to 1Q is for positive 65 again, this is all on corrugated. Is there any relationship between the 2? Did you walk from business as you were implementing pricing? Any thoughts on those 2 points would be welcome and good luck in the quarter. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. That's a great question, and the answer is no. We didn't walk away from business. The overachievement in price realization is just getting more price in certain segments of our customer mix during the first quarter than we expected. And that has a lot to do with the final negotiation of implementation and all of those types of things. On the larger customers, it tends to be a little more predictable because it's contractual in terms of time. I think one of the things you got to think about with respect to IP and the volume challenges, when we look at some of the customer issues, labor issues our customers have, when you think about the large food and protein producers on both, R&D, e-commerce producers, they had a very difficult time staffing everything in the month of January and it bled into February, and that reflected in our numbers.  So we didn't give up any volume, and we are now working to replenish their inventories because they were not running as full as they would like to. So part of it is just, we're in every segment, we're very large, and we get impacted by not only our own internal situation but in a single quarter over a 3-month period, what our customer flows back on us. So no volume give-up and just a better performance in getting each and every customer's price up. George Staphos : Big thank you to Guillermo, and congratulations to Mark. We look forward to working with you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Anthony Pettinari : Congrats to Guillermo and Mark on the new roles. Since you last gave guidance, you realized the March containerboard hike and I think a number of fluff pulp hikes, and it seems like 1Q went maybe a bit better than expected. I'm just wondering, in terms of reiterating the full year guidance versus maybe moving to the higher end of the range, is it fair to say you see raw material costs and inflation maybe offsetting the positives that you've seen in the last two months? Or are you -- are there concerns about demand or is it maybe just too early in the year? Anything that we should think about as we think about you maybe getting to the higher end or the lower end of the full year guidance range? Mark Sutton : Yes, Anthony, great question. It's obviously a hard one to predict and we're not any better at it than anyone. But I think the one thing we're looking at in terms of where we were 90 days ago when we gave our full year outlook is the wildcard on where energy is going to be for the rest of the year because energy is an input to most of our inputs. And so we are seeing that higher for longer. So yes, some of this additional pricing will be necessary. We didn't see that, I don't think anyone saw that at the end of January. I hope we're wrong on it because then we got much more opportunity for margin expansion. We're very confident on the pricing side that's being implemented right now. It's a judgment call on our view of energy. We don't try to do too much on our own. We look at strips. We look at the inputs to the chemical industry and the other things we use.  And then the last piece of energy is the flow-through to diesel fuel and our impact on transportation. So it's our best look right now. But we believe what Tim said, we believe in terms of principle that our pricing will overcome our input cost. As we sit here at the end of April, this is what we see for the rest of the year. I would imagine there'll be some adjustments as we sit here at the end of July, talking about whether or not energy actually did what everybody thinks it's going to do or not. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. And then George had a question on how you improve commercial performance and capabilities in Industrial Packaging. I guess I had kind of a similar question on Cellulose Fibers. I think Tim made some comments about maybe improving contract terms that can maybe help you next year. Just wondering to the extent you can, can you talk about improving the commercial performance in Cellulose Fibers, just obviously beyond the 6 hikes that you've announced, which are great, but any further thoughts there? Mark Sutton : I think it's really all inclusive of what we've been talking about for the last several quarters, getting paid for the value of the absorbent pulp. And I think you can start to see that as certain proof points of that out in the marketplace relative to absorbent pulp pricing versus market pulp pricing. And then how we operate the business, what we make available to long-term strategic customers and to shorter-term customers in different parts of the world. And then the final piece is where we are now, working actively with our very large strategic market-leading customers to improve the overall commercial conditions of these longer-term contracts, and that is set and underway now. It will go through the rest of the year. It will set us up for a very good position going into '23 and beyond. So it's a simple principle that in many cases, we just didn't fully exercise, and that is making sure our value is understood and then getting proper compensation for the value that we provide and the technical nature of the product. And that's what we're doing and I'm really happy with the progress.  I'll reiterate what Tim said, business will be solidly at slightly above cost of capital for the entire second half of the year, which sets us up very well for 2023. And we shouldn't have to be talking about whether the business is at a value-creating level of returns for very much longer. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Adam Josephson : Guillermo, congratulations. It was a real pleasure working with you. Tim, just a clarification on the Ilim cash dividend. I assume you got it last month and that it was around $200 million. Please correct me if I'm wrong there. And then just, I don't believe you would normally receive another one, regardless of the situation there. But can you just confirm that, what, if any, additional cash dividends you're expecting from Ilim and when and how much you got in presumably in March? Timothy Nicholls : Yes, you have the amount correct and there's no expectation of further dividends being paid this year. Adam Josephson : Okay, I appreciate that. And then Mark, just back to the pulp business. I mean, have you set a time line for yourself? In other words, okay, we need to get to a certain point by X date, X quarter, X year or else we say, you know what, because of the market structure, because of whatever else, this is just not working for us? I mean, it's been several years of underperformance, and at some point, the business needs to prove itself or not, I would think. Mark Sutton : Yes. We've set our internal targets. What I've said externally is businesses got the potential to be at value-creating levels of return. I just mentioned in answering Anthony's question that that's -- we're just about there in the second half of this year, and you'll have to see it to believe it, I understand that. And we're well positioned for the business to be at that level of performance now like in 2022. So it's right upon us. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. John Dunigan : This is John Dunigan on for Phil. I wanted to start off by reiterating prior comments and say thank you, Guillermo, for all the help. We really appreciate it and good luck in your new role.  I wanted to go back to the box shipment comment. Could you give any clarity on how the box shipments tracked throughout the quarter? Maybe how much was impacted by inventories in Prattville weighing on results maybe earlier in the quarter and then talk about how box shipments have tracked month-to-date? Timothy Nicholls : It's Tim. So Prattville really was not much of an issue at all for stock availability. We were able to run the mill partially before getting it back up full. So I wouldn't say that was a big item in the first quarter. It certainly hurt in the fourth quarter of last year. And we started off the quarter, from a box demand standpoint, near double-digit decline in January. We had the Omicron situation. We were having staffing issues because of people contracting COVID and being away from work, our customers, as Mark said, similarly, and so production lines for us and for some of our large accounts were not running as they normally would be. That began improving as we exited January and went into February. But I would say there was still a residual in February, and then by March, it was starting to feel more normal again. We had lines coming back up, and we were able to run our system not entirely to its full potential but more in line than certainly what it had been in January.  April is starting off kind of as expected. The recovery continues. And so we'll see how things shake out as we close the month in the next few days. But our cutup looks right in line with expectations that we have for Q2 in total. Mark Sutton : So John, Tim mentioned in his remarks when we were going -- when he was going through Industrial Packaging and he talked about the box -- IP box number but he also talked about the U.S. channels to the corrugated market. He explained what those were. On the slide, there's a minus 0.8 year-over-year. But that part, so that's the total U.S. channels minus 0.8 with a box number of minus 4.  So what we didn't say is the rest of the channels is open market containerboard and our equity partnerships through sheet feeders. And we were up 14% year-over-year in that part of the channel. So participating in the end-use box market, while we had certain issues and our customers had certain issues, other channels through containerboard and through these sheet feeders were better positioned.  Some of that was geographic. Some of that was size of account and size of customer. But our access to the U.S. packaging market, I think, is best viewed through that U.S. channels market. And so we offset some of our issues in our own box-making operations with those other channels such that our overall exposure was down just about 1%. John Dunigan : Okay, I appreciate that. I wanted to just switch over to Ilim. The earnings in the quarter came out ahead of expectations, and that was despite the significant contraction of the non-Chinese exports. Can you give us any color on the Ilim market dynamics? Next quarter seems like another solid result. Can you just kind of talk about overall cost in the region, demand and what you're kind of expecting as you're looking to ultimately get out of that business? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I think if you look at our outlook slide, you can see that the business, given all the puts and takes, is roughly expecting same level of performance in the second quarter than we had in the first. So there's a number of dynamics, but rather than going through all of those, I think the earnings expectations, what's important is right in line with first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Research. Mark Weintraub : And also my thanks to Guillermo for all your help in the last several years. You mentioned that the production system is now better aligned, and that certainly was something that had been an issue last year. Did the benefits from that show up in the first quarter? Or is that something that's going to start showing up more on a go-forward basis? Maybe I'll start there. Timothy Nicholls : I think it shows up in the first quarter, Mark, and will continue to show up. We did several things. We had inventory -- not only inventories but we had the right inventories in the right place, which is something we normally do very well, and I won't rehash all of last year's issues but that is what caused so much disruption last year. And as we exited the year and came in the first quarter, we were back on track there.  Mills also ran better and our converting operations ran better, if you look at just uptime, reliability, how they were performing. But the thing that continues to be a drag and will normalize at some point is our view, hard to predict when, is just all of these logistics disruptions that are taking place. So there's, across every mode of transportation, rail, truck and then for export, ocean freight, things are either moving slower or they're not as reliable or they're taking longer once they leave, from a velocity standpoint, to get there. And because these mills are meant to run, make product, put it in some form of transportation and move it, that can have an impact on operations. Still, it's better and our team, our supply chain team is working through it diligently. We're making progress but we're working with what we have available, given rail constraints and trucking constraints across the system. Does that make sense? Mark Weintraub : It does. That's super helpful. And so was the issue with the volumes through your box system, so is it -- that was primarily more -- I mean, you mentioned it was customer where they didn't have facilities other and maybe that's a function of your customer mix being more heavily focused on those types of customers?  And/or the other -- or was it that you were particularly hard-hit by Omicron in terms of your facilities? And I guess we'll see where the industry data is soon enough. But trying to sort of understand how much of it was specific to you guys versus just more normal across the industry type of events. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I mean, for us, it was across the entire supply chain. So it was how we were getting more to our box plants, how we were able to convert it and then move finished product to customers and their ability to consume the product and need replenishment. So it was throughout the entire supply chain. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Because you talked about kind of getting back in line with industry growth in the box business, is there anything that sort of put that on delay from your perspective from what you would have said previously? Timothy Nicholls : I don't think so. It's just a matter of normalizing some of these disruptions, and we feel like we've -- we're doing a good job doing that. And transportation is going to continue to be an issue, but in terms of growing, we don't see an issue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo. Gabrial Hajde : Guillermo, pleasure working with you. Welcome, Mark. I wanted to ask you a question, I guess, under the context that inventories are sort of back to where you want them to be. And I think the North American low-cost producer position is even now more pronounced than it was before as well as other parts of the world not importing containerboard from, let's say, Russia. Are you seeing any pickup or are the phones ringing anymore in terms of potential for export demand? I appreciate that ocean freight is a little bit of an impediment at this point. But just thinking about kind of the practical aspects there.  And then does this alter your view, Mark, in any way for the intrinsic value kind of your mills here in North America versus other parts of the world? Mark Sutton : First part of your question, Dave, yes, we are seeing, as you expected, increased demand for export. Port congestion is a timing issue for getting it there in a reasonable time but the demand is picking up. Our output is in much better shape. We had a good year of annual outages in '21 after a choppy 2020 because of COVID and construction availability, plus we've got the big issues behind us that affected our containerboard output all the way through our box plants.  So we've got more containerboard to sell through all the channels. Still working very hard to manage the part that goes offshore through the ports.  Look, we like our North American mill system. We think it's globally competitive for the long term. We don't get too excited about short-term trends of high, high OCC or low, low OCC. The business model we have and the mix we have between virgin mills and recycled mills and the overall fiber makeup, we have renewable natural resources coming into our company. We convert them, making most of our own energy in a carbon-neutral way, and we make corrugated boxes that are recycled. And I think that business model is a strong, strong business model from a profitability standpoint and a sustainability standpoint.  All the other discussions about recycled in different parts of the world, I'll start with that. You have to be a renewable natural resource that's virgin fiber to even have a discussion about recycled. And we are well positioned at about 65% wood fiber coming in, 35% recovered paper, making most of our own energy, I really feel very strong and our customers do as well about our sustainable business model. Gabrial Hajde : Okay. One quick maintenance item. Are there any, Tim, insurance recoveries left that you might be getting over the balance of the year? Timothy Nicholls : I'm sorry? Mark Sutton : In insurance. Timothy Nicholls : It's hard to say. We're finalizing last bits of Prattville and whatnot, so I wouldn't predict at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Wilde. Mark Wilde : Congratulations on a good quarter and congratulations to Guillermo. Tim, I have a question for you first. And that is, it sounds to me like over the last 18 months, you may have been kind of subcontracting out some more of your box volume, just with kind of a tight labor market and strong demand from some of your customers. I wondered if first, you could confirm that.  And secondly, as you bring that back in-house, what might the margin impact of just that element alone be? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I mean, I don't have detailed numbers off the top of my head, Mark. We do some farm-outs. We do some of them because it's just more economical in the grand scheme to either put it in one of our sheet plants or if there's not an IPG plant locally available to use, a partner in terms of fulfilling certain orders. We flex that up and down. It's not super structural to the business. It's more just using marginal economics in terms of how we run a very large system. Mark Wilde : But have you been doing more of that in the last 18 months? Timothy Nicholls : We probably did some last year as we were going through some of the board constraint issues that we had, just given the system. But I would say it is situational. And again, it's there but I wouldn't say that it's hugely material to the size of the business that we have. Mark Wilde : Okay, that's what I was looking for. And then Mark, I have a question just longer term. If you look at the containerboard industry, we've seen a lot of consolidation over the last 20 or 25 years. We've got 3 or 4 big players. And I'm just curious now, with the new entrants trying to come into the market, some from offshore, how do you protect IP from becoming General Motors? . Mark Sutton : Yes. I think it's an ongoing discussion around the business is a good business so therefore, it attracts interested parties. And I think the way you protect your business is you perform very well and you ingratiate yourself with your customers to the point where you're an integral part of their value chain. It's one thing to say, \"I'm going to build a containerboard mill.\" It's another thing to supply hundreds and hundreds of locations for a large e-commerce customer or reliably supply, every day of the week, a local business of multiple different grades of containerboard made into boxes that they need, not just 1.  So I think it really starts with the whole value chain and making sure that from a customer looking back into IP, and there are others that are very good at this as well, that we have the relationship with our customers and all the supply chain services, all the things that make a business relationship sticky is, I think, the best defense. Everything else is table stakes : lowering your cost, operating safely and environmentally sound and all those things. But I really think it matters how you deal with your customers overthinking.  And I think if you think about COVID in 2020 and 2021, we did some amazing things with and for our customers that they're going to remember for a very long time when the next great thing comes knocking at the door. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Congratulations, Guillermo. I'm looking forward to working with you as well, Mark. Apologies if I missed this, but on inventories, can you just give us a sense of your inventory levels in containerboard and how they compared to last quarter and maybe where they are at relative to where you would like in terms of your target levels? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I mean, we don't have hard numbers but inventory is in a very good position right now. And it's really important. Coming out of the fourth quarter and the first quarter, it being the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year and maybe the heaviest one we've ever had, which takes production offline as we take these mills down for maintenance. We had inventories in a good place and we exited the quarter with inventories in a good place. So we feel good about how we're positioned right now. Kyle White : Got it. And then on the building back better planned initiatives that you have, are you able to give us a sense in terms of how much benefits, net of the dis-synergies, you realized this quarter? And then as we look to the second half, the 20% margins that you expect for Industrial Packaging, do you have line of sight to accelerating that into 2023, just given some of the price realization in these initiatives? Or should we expect kind of a similar margin profile, just given that a lot of the maintenance occurred already in the first quarter relative to the second half? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. I mean, we're a long way from 2023 in terms of getting into details. I do think that given what we've been able to do to restore where we are from an inventory standpoint and how the facilities are actually running in the environment, given also past price increases now, we're beginning to start the March 2022 price increase, we're well positioned as we go into the second half of the year and feel good about the springboard for 2023.  Remind me the first part of your question again, I'm sorry. Kyle White : Yes. I was just curious if you had the number in terms of what benefit you realized from the Building Better IP initiatives, net of the dis-synergies in this quarter. Timothy Nicholls : $40 million. So we had -- we were carrying into the year roughly $94 million, close to $100 million in dis-synergies. And we feel like through the work that we've done in the quarter on an annualized basis, we've covered that. Operator : Our last question or final question for today comes from Paul Quinn of RCBC Capital Markets RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Just a question on Cellulose Fibers. I seem to be over-predicting your shipment volumes every quarter here, and I'm just trying to understand the business because if I look at it year-over-year, you were down in shipments by 186,000 tons. And you described it as solid mill performance, which suggests that production should be up. Are you carrying a lot of inventory due to the logistics challenges in Cellulose Fibers? And what can we expect for your shipment volumes in '22? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. So we're not carrying tons of inventory. What we're doing is modulating how the mill is run based on availability of transportation logistics. And the challenge has been for some time now and continues, as I've referenced in some of the prepared remarks, just reliability of ocean vessels being super low and then also vessel delays, meaning they arrive at a port and they're ready to be unloaded, and that's historically been about 1 day and now, on average, they're waiting 5. So it's just getting products through the supply chain, but we're modulating how we run the system so that we're producing ultimately what we can get through the supply chain. Paul Quinn : Okay. So volumes in '22 should be very similar to '21 or is it back to sort of the numbers that we saw in '20? Timothy Nicholls : I think it depends on what happens with ocean freight. We export 90% of what we make, and so it depends on what's going to happen with containers and vessels for the balance of the year. But I mean, probably in line, yes, but I mean, a lot of questions around how supply chain is going to work. Operator : I will turn the call back over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark Sutton, for closing comments. Mark Sutton : I just want to reiterate a few closing comments. Very confident and very optimistic about the future of IP. We have a strong 2022 earnings growth outlook. We're making very good progress and momentum as we focus on our initiatives around Building a Better IP, and we have a very strong balance sheet. The company is as strong as it's ever been financially. All of this accelerates value creating for our shareowners. So thank you very much for your interest in International Paper. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : Thank you for participating in International Paper's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you'll have an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn today's conference over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Paul. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is also available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our second quarter 2022 earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on slide three. In the second quarter, International Paper delivered strong revenue growth and earnings growth on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, all while expanding our margins. In addition, our second quarter earnings were better than our prior outlook, driven by strong price realization, solid operating performance, and cost benefits. All of this helped us overcome significantly higher input costs, especially for energy, chemicals, and distribution. Our mills and converting system performed very well as we managed through continued logistics constraints, which negatively impacted our operating costs. We successfully executed our second highest maintenance quarter of the year and have completed about 65% of our planned maintenance in the first half of the year. Demand for our products was impacted by a shift in consumer spending from goods to services in the quarter, while the retail channel managed through elevated inventories. In addition, our businesses continue to focus on serving our customers' needs, while navigating through a challenging supply chain and labor environment. We made good progress on building a better IP initiatives. We achieved $65 million of earnings in the quarter for a total of $105 million during the first half of the year. Given our strong momentum, we expect to achieve the high end of our full year target of $200 million to $225 million. We are excited by the opportunities we have identified to significantly lower our cost structure and accelerate profitable growth. On capital allocation, we returned $565 million to shareholders in the second quarter, including 395 million of share repurchases. As a result, we've returned more than $1.1 million of cash to shareholders so far this year. This highlights the choices that our strong balance sheet and cash generation provide us. On our last call, I mentioned that we were pursuing strategic options for our equity investment in the Ilim Group, which includes possibly selling our 50% stake. We have engaged advisors and are actively working with interested parties. We've made good progress during the second quarter and have identified serious options that we believe could be attractive. As I mentioned before, the complexity of the situation and our JV structure impacts the pace of reaching a resolution. We will provide another update when there is more information to share. Turning to the second quarter results on slide four, revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization across our two business segments. Operating earnings per share improved by just over 50% versus last year. And margins improved in the second quarter as strong price realization more than offset higher distribution input cost and we delivered additional benefits from our Building a Better IP initiatives. Free cash flow was lower in the quarter due to higher working capital use as we grew revenues and replenished inventories coming out of our highest maintenance outage season. In addition, both prior periods included a dividend from our equity ownership at Ilim. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect further margin expansion as continued realization of prior price increases outpaces higher input costs. In addition, we stepped down from our highest maintenance outage quarters of the year and also expect additional earnings growth from our Building a Better IP initiatives. As a result, I'm confident we will achieve our full year targets for EBITDA and free cash flow, which remain unchanged. I'll turn the call over to Tim who will cover our business sector performance and outlook. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide five which is our sequential earnings bridge. As Mark mentioned, we generated strong earnings growth in the second quarter in the prior quarter and prior year, driven by strong price realization and execution of our Building a Better IP initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.24 as compared to $0.76 in the first quarter. Price and mix improved by about $206 million, or $0.40 per share with strong price realization in both business segments and across all channels. Volume was relatively flat sequentially in our Industrial Packaging segment and Global Cellulose Fibers, fluffed up shipments continued to be constrained by ongoing vessel delays. Operations and costs improved sequentially as our mills and converting system performs well. In the second quarter, we received $16 million of insurance recovery related to Prattville. In addition, one-time items for things like lower employee benefits costs, medical claims, and workers' comp contributed favorably to operations and cost. These one-time items added about $80 million or $0.16 per share, which will not repeat in the third quarter. We successfully completed our second highest maintenance outage quarter of the year and 65% of our annual maintenance program for the first half of the year. Input costs were about $100 million, or $0.20 per share in second quarter, driven by higher energy, chemicals and distribution costs, in large part because of higher diesel fuel prices. On slide 33 of the appendix, we provide details on our consumption by key inputs including natural gas, which was also a significant costs headwind and the quarter. Corporate and other items included benefits from lower tax expense and a lower share count. Lastly, equity earnings for stable versus the prior quarter. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on slide six. Looking at the second quarter performance, we delivered meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion. Price and mix was strong and better than our expectations due to a faster than expected implementation of our March price increase and higher export prices. Our volume was flat sequentially and below last year's strong comp. As Mark mentioned earlier, we saw a shift in consumer spending from goods and services and the retail channel managed through elevated inventories which then impacted box demand across segments like e-commerce and shipping and distribution, durables, and other non-durables. We firmly believe these segments will continue to grow over time and that IP is well-positioned to grow with them. In addition, the tight labor environment continues to constrain our box system. We're experiencing this especially in regions where we're consistently operating our plants on weekends to serve elevated demand from segments like e-commerce and shipping and distribution that have grown significantly during the last couple of years. Going forward, we will continue to focus on further optimizing our system by improving staffing levels and investing across the system to serve the growing demand of our customers. Operations in cost improved sequentially. Our mills and box system ran very well and we successfully executed as our second highest maintenance outage of the year. The business also benefited from additional insurance recovery of $16 million related to Prattville and the one-time items I mentioned earlier like proximately $60 million. Operating costs remain elevated due to ongoing logistics constraints. However, we are in a much better position to navigate this environment with healthier system inventories. Input cost were significant headwind in the second quarter and higher than our expectations due to higher costs for energy chemicals and distribution. We expect these elevated costs to persist in the third quarter. These cost headwinds are even more significant for our Packaging business in Europe where input costs in the second quarter or $45 million higher than the second quarter of last year. About 70% of that headwind was from higher energy costs where natural gas prices have averaged about five times normal historical level. Turning to slide seven and staying with North American Industrial Packaging, we're focused on continuing to grow earnings by restoring margins to historical levels in the low 20% range. We've made solid progress in the quarter and delivered a 19% margin, up from just over 15% in the first quarter despite higher than expected input costs. We're still confident we can achieve our target; however, the additional input cost inflation may influence the timing. Our mills and box plants operated very well. Containerboard inventories across our system are back to sufficient levels, so we're better positioned to proactively manage through the ongoing supply chain constraints. As I said earlier, we will deploy an investment strategy that further enhances our capabilities and footprint to grow with our customers, while generating attractive financial returns on these investments. This is a key part of Building a Better IP and an example of this is the Greenfield Box plant that we're building in Southeast Pennsylvania which is expected to start up early next year. In addition, our Building a Better IP initiatives are also focused on structurally reducing costs and deploying commercial strategies to improve mix and margins. Moving on to Global Cellulose Fibers on slide eight, I'll start with an update on the demand environment and supply chain. Demand for fluff pulp remains solid across all regions. Our confidence reflects the essential role of absorbent hygiene products and meeting customer needs. In addition, we expect the supply demand environment for fluff to remain favorable near-term. Feedback from our customers continues to indicate the fluff pulp inventories are near historic lows. Supply chains continue to remain stretched, driven by ongoing port congestion and vessel delays and we expect these challenging conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. Taking a look at the second quarter performance, price and mix improved by $53 million due to successful execution of previously announced price increases, with solid momentum as we entered the third quarter. Volume in the quarter was stable. I would note that backlogs remain high and are about double our normalized levels due to the logistics challenges. Our mills continue to run well, ops and costs are better in the quarter as the business benefited from one-time items I mentioned earlier by approximately $20 million. Lastly, input costs increased by $22 million sequentially. About 65% of the additional costs was the result of higher energy prices with the remainder coming from higher chemicals and freight. Turning to slide nine, I want to reaffirm that Global Cellulose Fibers remains well-positioned to deliver cost of capital returns in the third and fourth quarters of this year. As I said earlier, we have a favorable supply demand outlook for fluff pulp with price realization from prior increase accelerating as we move through the year. I would also note that as part of Building a Better IP, we're focused on driving structural margin improvement by ensuring we get the paid value we provide to our customers and aligning with the most attractive regions and segments to deliver profitable growth. We are also making solid progress in our fluff pulp contract negotiations, which we anticipate will provide additional commercial benefits as we move into 2023. Turning to slide 10, I'd like to update you on Building a Better IP set of initiatives. We're making solid progress and delivered $65 million in earnings in the second quarter for a total of $105 million for the first half of the year. Given the strong momentum, we're on track to achieve the high end of our full year target. About half the benefits today are from our lean effectiveness initiatives. By streaming streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with our more simplified portfolio, we have already offset 100% of the dis-synergies from the printing paper spend. And we have line of sight to additional savings from initiatives targeting lower overhead spending and further optimization. We're designing the organization to support a packaging-focused company with a more focused footprint. We believe our process optimization initiatives have the potential to significantly reduce costs across our operations by leveraging advanced technology and data analytics. Over the past year, dedicated teams have been working with outside experts to identify opportunities and develop new tools and capabilities to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics, and sourcing. We're beginning to scale these capabilities across our system, which we believe will yield significant savings as we go through 2023. And finally, strategy acceleration is about delivering profitable growth through commercial and investment excellence. As I mentioned earlier, we're focused on profitably growing our North American Packaging business by improving margins and investing for organic growth. We're further optimizing our European operations by improving performance and increasing integration of our Madrid Mail Inbox System. And we're well on our way to achieve cost to capital returns and our Global Cellular Fibers business by realizing more value for absorbent pulp. In summary, Building a Better IP is about driving structural margin improvement and profitable growth. Turning to slide 11, I'll cover our third quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $40 million on realization of prior [indiscernible]. Volume is expected to increase by $10 million, with one more day sequentially and stable demand. Ops and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $75 million, largely due to the non-repeat of the one-time favorable items I mentioned earlier. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $41 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $30 million. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to improve by $60 million on the realization the prior increases. As a reminder, price realization in this segment has a two to three quarter lag. We're running on the longer end of that range right now due to the ongoing vessel delays. Volume is expected to remain stable sequentially. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $30 million, due to non-repeat favorable one-time items in the second quarter and timing of spending. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $24 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $5 million. Looking to our full year outlook on slide 12. We remain confident in our full year EBITDA outlook of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion and our free cash flow target of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We generated strong revenue growth and margin expansion in the second quarter, exceeding our earnings outlook for the quarter, which provides solid momentum as we enter the second half of the year. We expect demand for Corrugated Packaging to remain stable and Cellulose Fibers, we see a continued favorable supply/demand backdrop for fluff pulp. We continue to realize benefits across the portfolio from the implementation of current price increases, while distribution and input costs are expected to stabilize later this year at elevated levels. As I mentioned earlier, we are also confident in achieving $225 million of gross earnings from our Building a Better IP initiatives. Regarding capital expenditures we have lowered our full year estimate by $100 million due to extended lead-times on equipment purchases. Despite these equipment delays, we are committed to investing in our business to support strategic growth opportunities and to structurally reduce our costs. Let me turn to slide 13 and take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the second quarter. Starting with the balance sheet, as I said last quarter, we're very pleased with the progress we've made to strengthen our balance sheet. As a reminder, we reduce debt by $2.5 billion in 2021 and more than $4 billion over the past two years. With these actions, our 2021 year end leverage was 2.3 times on a Moody's basis, which is below our target range of 2.5 to 2.8 times and looking ahead, we have limited medium term maturities was about $900 million do over the next five years. Returning cash to shareholders as a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second quarter we returned $565 million to shareholders, including $395 million through share repurchases, which represents 8.7 million shares or about 2.3% of shares outstanding. As a result, we've returned more than $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders so far this year. At the end of the second quarter, we had $2.1 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash. As I mentioned, we are targeting CapEx of $1 billion, which includes funding for strategic projects and our Packaging business to build out capabilities and capacity in our box system to drive profitable growth. We also plan to increase funding for cost reduction projects with expected returns in excess of 25%. We will continue to be disciplined and selective when assessing M&A opportunities that may supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt on opportunities in our Packaging Business in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must be compelling long-term value for our shareholders. The slide 14, I want to highlight the strength and resiliency of International Paper going forward. With this as a backdrop I'm confident IP will navigate any economic environment from a position of strength. We have a very strong balance sheet, which we will preserve because we believe it's core to our capital obligation framework. Our strong balance sheet ensures financial stability and optionality and softer economic environments and it's the foundation to create significant value throughout the economic cycle. As a result, we can continue to return cash to shareholders in a meaningful way through a sustainable and competitive dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. We can also proactively invest in our business throughout the cycle to create significant value by reducing costs and by developing the capabilities we need to meet the growing demands of our customers. Our large system of mills and box plants provides us with added advantage of flexibility and optionality. We've demonstrated our ability to optimize our cost structure throughout different demand environments by making more of our costs less fixed and more variable. For example, we can increase utilization across our system during strong demand environments and if demand moderates, we can shift production to our lowest cost operations and shed high marginal costs across the system based on regional costs for fiber, energy, and supply chain. We also have levers to manage working capital needs to align with the demand signal. One last point, as I talked about our competence in delivering our Building a Better IP initiatives, we have line of sight to these opportunities and believe they are largely within our control and not dependent on economic tailwind. In summary, the strength and resiliency at IP enables us to consistently create significant value for our shareholders over the cycle. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Tim, thanks for covering the details on the business outlook and our capital allocation progress. This is a really exciting time for International Paper and I continue to be proud of our team and the work that they do every day in every area of the company. Sitting here midway through the year, I'm confident in our earnings outlook for 2022 and in our ability to deliver strong earnings growth this year. I'm also very pleased with our progress and momentum in Building a Better IP and I'm confident our team is focused on taking our performance to the next level. As Tim pointed out in his remarks earlier, these initiatives are largely within our control and will create structural earnings improvement for IP over the next couple of years. And finally, we're mindful of the uncertainty surrounding the macro environment, I'm very certain about the resiliency of International Paper. During the past few years, we have significantly enhanced our financial strength and flexibility. This strong foundation makes IP well-positioned for success throughout a wide spectrum of economic environments. With that operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Seaport Research Partner and the line of Mark Weintraub. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Good morning. Question on what you're seeing in the corrugated box business. I think you mentioned that retail, they were working through elevated inventories your customers, where do you think you might be in that process? Also at any more color on that that comment you made goods to services? And relatedly you talked about flattish volumes in the third quarter. Was that a sequential relative to second quarter? Was that a year-over-year wrapping? Because I think your second quarter documents were somewhat lower than your third quarter from a year ago? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Hey, Mark, its Tim. Yes, it is sequential down a little bit year-over-year. So, I mean, it's a good question about time to work off excess inventories. And what we're seeing, I guess our belief is hearing from customers that we think it's going to take a little bit more time. There have been some shifts, more travel, less purchase of goods that we've noticed. Also just unit volume through retail, as people adjust given the high inflation rates, so, but it seems like that was a fairly quick shift as people are making day-to-day decisions. And so our view is we're in the third quarter, is that it's going to be roughly flat from second to third. Mark Weintraub : Okay, and obviously did great on price and mix, just one clarification, when you had been giving us kind of expectations on cost and operations, had that been including the one-time $80 million in total, or how much of that might have been in your guidance? Timothy Nicholls : If we know about it, we included sometimes things come through just better than expected in its timing. I mean, some of it was probably expected not to hit until the third quarter. And so it happens in the second, it's not going to happen again. So, when you think about the one time you think about two and three together, I think we're about where we thought we were going to be. Mark Weintraub : Okay, that was a mix. Some of the you're expecting, but not all of it, is that fair? Timothy Nicholls : Yes, right. Mark Weintraub : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we go to Wells Fargo Securities and the line of Gabe Hajde. Please go ahead. Gabe Hajde : Hey Mark, Tim, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on CapEx, I think it came down about $100 million from what you're previously expecting. And I'm curious, I mean, kind of given inflation that we're seeing, I would expect just maybe a little bit of a natural tendency upwards? Is this a reflection of anything that you're seeing in the business in terms of willingness to put capital to work, being conservative or are there projects that you just kind of push to the right maybe to 2023 until you get better visibility into the business? Mark Sutton : That's a great question Gabe. This is Mark. Its purely on ability to actually spend your money. Fair amount of our capital is investments in our Packaging business, which is new plans for new equipment. And what we're hearing from our vendors is the backlog for some of that equipment, push some of our spending out. We do see escalation and if we could do everything we wanted to do in the calendar year of 2022, we'd probably be looking at raising our capital, but it's really just an ability to get the items we need purchased. It's less about installation labor, it's more about new OEM equipment, which is a big part of our non-maintenance capital, and most all of it is in the box business. So, we'd spend it if we could, is a simple way to say it, no change in strategy. No, change in our focus, just the ability to get all of that done and account for it in the calendar year 2022. Gabe Hajde : Right, thank you. And then I guess in terms of end markets within corrugated, you mentioned retail as one and I guess e-commerce is sort of moderating. Are you seeing anything on the export markets? I mean, one of the things that they were kind of keeping an eye out for is obviously to the extent they're rolling capacity outages over in Europe because of energy availability and/or costs. Maybe the export lever kind of ticks up for you guys, anything there? Timothy Nicholls : On export, I'll talk first and then containerboard. On pulp, as I mentioned in the comments, supply/demand fundamentals remain very strong. We try to look through by region as much as we can to gauge inventories and, of course, we talked to customers and what they're telling us and inventory levels look like they're at historic lows at the moment. So, we expect underlying demand to continue to be strong, globally for fluff pulp and certainly supply chain is contributing to that because the vessel delays are really not much better than they have been for past several quarters. On containerboard, I think you're referencing Europe. We are going down in the third quarter into a seasonally slower period of time in Europe, we saw solid demand and we saw a price increase through the second quarter. It may moderate a moment just as a seasonally slow period, but we don't see any significant underlying weakness there. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. And next, we go to Bank of America and the line of George Staphos. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess the first question I had, obviously, IP has been spending more, understandably, on the box network and additional converting. You've had mill projects like Riverdale, can you remind us on where in your capital budget? You think you'll need to spend just on fiber lines and recovery boilers? How do you see your fleet there? Will there be any incremental investment that's required there or not? And kind of the related if you will corrugated question. You were answering Dave's question earlier on, on exports. How do you see some of your other domestic markets in particular? What are you hearing right now from your from your ag and protein customers? We're just seeing two key what's the outlook for next year, given what have been some of the drought conditions that have been discussed? And I had one follow-on. Timothy Nicholls : So George, on the capital spending, we take a longer term view on capital. I think what you're talking about would be what we characterize as maintenance capital, that there's nothing that we're looking at in terms of major back ended mill types of expansions or additions. So we probably been a little bit lower in the past couple of years on maintenance. It's up this year, but it kind of normalizes in that roughly $500 million a year range. So, -- and again, on maintenance, we take a five-year view. And so it does ebb and flow just because of timing of when equipment needs to be taken down and maintain some of that periodic -- some of it's on an annual basis, but I wouldn't call out anything exceptional around the capital part. And then what was the second part of your question? I'm sorry. George Staphos : It's just a box market domestically in particular, we're probing is protein markets. What are you hearing from customers now and into 2023 given drought conditions, and what that can mean for amongst other things, cattle raising, and production as a result? Timothy Nicholls : Yes, I think on protein, we expect poultry to be strong, most popular form of protein and given cost increases across all the protein. Maybe there's a shift from beef and pork to poultry. So, we think we think generally a protein should be okay. Poultry should probably be the beneficiary in the foreseeable future. Mark Sutton : I think the drought comments, George is primarily in beef issue because they'll have to process some of the cattle early. But it doesn't affect the availability as much on things like poultry. It affects obviously, the price of feed and the cost of those products. But it's the beef issue where they will have to pull forward the slaughter of a certain amount of the herd earlier than they would like. George Staphos : Thanks a lot. My last one and I'll turn it over. So, overall, I realize you don't want to make this too formal and guidance or an algebra class. Our takeaway from your discussion earlier on the outlook should be that if we added our numbers, right, we're looking at sort of flattish sequential performance in industrial and we kind of a $50 million-ish increase in pulp, would that be correct? And when do you ultimately see on the pulp side the supply chains normalizing, is that something fourth quarter -- I realize it's ultimately a who knows. But when are your contacts like that that should normalize? So, thanks for that and good luck in the quarter. Timothy Nicholls : Yes, I'd say you're in the ballpark and the way you're thinking about it, George, on supply chains. I think you had that right too, who knows. One port seems to improve and another port seems to deteriorate and we've seen it both on the East Coast where it's very important for the fluff pulp business. The West Coast ports have knock on effects for sometimes, but it seems to be just moving port forward. Mark Sutton : And George -- Tim's, right, I mean, we look at it very, very closely because of the export posture of our Cellulose Fibers. We honestly can't see any market improvement calendar year 2022. So, we're probably looking into 2023 when maybe there's some balanced returns to vessel shipping and port throughput. But we -- maybe we're wrong, but we definitely don't see anything on the horizon as far as we can really look. George Staphos : Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And next we go to the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Morning. Timothy Nicholls : Good morning. Mark Wilde : I want to just turn to cellulose specialties for a minute and try and unpack getting the cost of capital there because it sounds like first of all, if you're outed essentially kind of a three quarter price lag, what we saw in the second quarter is probably more indicative of what we would have seen last year in the third quarter, in terms of kind of net price. And I guess I'd like to have you just unpack for us that lags and pricing. And then the things you're doing to try to improve the business, because just look at the prices that are posted right now. They're at the high end at a historic range. So, I'm just trying to get some comfort in if and when pulp rolls over, that you're actually going to be able to maintain close to capital returns? Mark Sutton : I think on the unpacking part of your question; the two to three quarter lag is an all-in, part of that is obviously spot by definition goes up immediately on the placement order. And then there's different levels of contracts with customers. And when you put it all together, announced price of x is actually equal to x two to three quarters later. So, we've got a got our business part and contract part and spot and that's why you see a unique realization, scheduled for IP that may not look like anybody else's. So, that's also what provides that dynamic of the contract. These also provides the resilience on any kind of turnover in in pricing, just like it slowed it all the way up and slows way down. So, I think when we have the second half in the books, there'll be two quarters in a row at, you know, above cost of capital performance or right at cost of capital performance. We've made some structural changes in our go to market strategy, regionally on the spot side, and just contractually on the large customer contract side, which will still be in effect in a different pulp market. So, we think through a cycle, the purpose of work we've been doing is to have this business perform at the cost of capital through a normal business cycle. Tim set it in kind of strange language we are working and have made tremendous progress. We're working to get paid for the value of the absorbent pulp that it provides in the end products. And that hasn't always been the case. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. That's for my follow on market. I would just like to follow-up on your comments around both on M&A in industrial packaging in North America and Europe. I\u2019m just curious would bolt-on rule out sort of a large deal, like you were looking at in Europe three or four years ago? Mark Sutton : Yes, that's not bolt -- that wouldn't be what we would consider bolt-on. Bolt on, think about this -- think about it this way Mark, in Europe, we have a smaller business a $1.5 in revenue roughly. And we've done some single and multiple plant acquisitions to build an integrated network around our new containerboard mill Madrid. So natural synergy to an existing part of our business, but we did enter a new a new market. We entered the Portugal market. We didn't have anything there before, but it's integrated to the Madrid mill. So that would be bolt-on, and in the US a much bigger business. So it could be more synergistic with a containerboard and box system, but not transformational. I think what we've been saying for a while is this is the first time IP has been in a position with a balance sheet like we have with a much more streamlined portfolio, and to businesses that have a right to win in their respective markets. And we're going to run with that strategy. Now there's no need for transformational activity. We went through a lot of that. We undid some of it, and we got a company we really like right now. And now it's about getting it to its full potential. Mark Wilde : Okay, and is there any way in North America, Mark, just that help us a little bit in thinking about sort of regulatory barriers on your growth in the containerboard business? Mark Sutton : It's hard to say, a lot of time has passed since the last time we made any meaningful move, but there's no real reason we can't grow our converting and box business. And you've seen how we've chosen. Everyone has seen how we've chosen to grow our containerboard system to match that box. And that's been mostly through organic activity. And so I don't know the answer to your question, because we haven't tested it. It was an issue back in 2012, where we did get pushback on how much we were trying to acquire. But that was a long time ago. But our focus right now, honestly, is we have enough containerboard for the foreseeable future, we did to Riverdale mill. We've gotten more opportunity in our current fleet to make more containerboard. It's really about making sure we have the box business configured both with assets and with people. And we're short on both of those right now to be able to actually grow at a minimum with the market. Some of that's regional, but on average, we don't have enough of either to really grow with a two plus percent market. And that's what we want to do. We have the containerboard to do that. Mark Wilde : Okay. And fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Then next from Deutsche Bank, Kyle White. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In industrial packaging in North America, you talked about some of the labor challenges, but I'm just curious how you would characterize your overall network from an efficiency standpoint versus maybe a year ago, you've had a lot of headwinds over the past year from disruption. Is there still more to go on that front in terms of making the network more efficient, that could produce better margins in no lower marginal cost production? Mark Sutton : And Kyle, it's a great question. We're running very well, right now. The issues we had in the mill system last year with the interruptions at the beginning of the year, and the end of the year, and our low inventories in our box plants, we've largely put all of that behind us, the box plants are running very well for all the efficiency metrics like throughput that the margin would generate per hour of production time, where we are challenged is in certain regions, we just don't have enough people. So we ended up making that up with overtime, which is not a long-term sustainable solution, a certain amount is but not too much. So we need some plants that are not running as many shifts as it is they couldn't be running for the demand. That's where people come in. And then in certain parts of the country, upper Midwest, area in Southwest Texas, we need more physical assets, as well as people. And that's what we're working on the assets through our CapEx investment plan. And on the people side, working very hard to hire and retain new employees so that we can run out the assets we have in a more sustainable way, not just working every weekend, and run to the order book that we have. So efficiency is fine. The total available capacity we have with equipment and people is not where we want to be. Kyle White : Got it. And then Georgetown mill, you have that supply agreement with the Sylvamo that can be terminated here in the next six months or so. Any kind of early thoughts about that supply agreement? Mark Sutton : Yes. Not right now. I got confused. I think Georgetown may be a little bit longer. I think Riverdale is a little bit shorter, but yes, there's nothing new to report at this moment. Kyle White : That's good. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. The next we go to KeyBanc and line of Adam Josephson. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. Thanks very much. Hope you're well. For either of you, can you help me with what you're box shipment expectations were heading into the quarter compared to the down 3.6% that you experienced. And can you walk us through the progression of demand trends during the quarter and then into July and how that's informing your expectation that shipments excluding the one extra shipping day will be flattish sequentially? Mark Sutton : Yes, I think, obviously, we thought there were going to be a little bit stronger as we were going through the quarter seem to -- the adjustments seems to take place. And I'd say, the second half of May and a little bit into June, I think it's a reaction to things we talked about earlier. Inflation is real. People are making choices. And there's -- as we've read and heard, heard from our customers, there's a lot of inventory and pipelines that needs to be worked off. So but it seems to stabilize and seems to stay the stable around the same level as we go through July. Our view is sequentially. It should be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, obviously, down a little bit versus last year, but stable quarter-over-quarter. Adam Josephson : Right. And I appreciate that. But just the inflation, obviously, these pressures haven't gone away at all. In fact, if anything, all these CPG companies are just raising prices even more, everyone's raising prices more, it seems like so. And obviously Walmart just got it down. And so they still have too much inventory of general merchandise because people are under so much pressure, the cost of food and consumables is up so much. So with those pressures don't seem to be abating in the least. So I guess why would box demand stabilized now? Timothy Nicholls : Well, we look at our mix of business, and we talk to our customers. And then we have the experience of how we ended the quarter. And how\u2019s continued in July. So based on that we have a view that through the third quarter, and there's always some seasonal puts and takes, but we have a view that within a margin of error, it's a roughly flat what we have the second quarter. Adam Josephson : Got it. Thank you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And next Truist Securities, Mike Roxland. Please go ahead. Mike Roxland : Thanks, Mark and Tim for taking the questions. Just like to understand, you mentioned faster implementation of the March price increase, but what's driving that? Mark Sutton : Faster implementation, I think it's consistent with prior increases that were implemented, it's the security of supply. And people want to get that, for the longest time wanted to make sure they had boxes and just making sure that there's no disruption to their operations. So we -- the first price for several price increases were the fastest we've seen on any historical comparison. And this last one seems to be going at the same pace. By the end of the third quarter, we'll have most of it done. There's a little bit of residue or residual that falls over into the fourth quarter, but so far, it's continuing as the prior increases. Mike Roxland : Got it. Makes sense. And then just one follow-up from some of the prior questions in your commentary regarding some inventory destocking. Obviously, I really got to put and takes it's in the details. This will make the deadlines versus long variable. But ultimately, they need -- I assume understand you guys need to see some benefits from omni-channel as well. So maybe you're getting some wins from increased maybe interactivity. So can you talk about any shifts that you'd be making your own business to offset the decline in e-commerce and some of the markets you mentioned? Mark Sutton : I'm sorry. You broke up just a little bit. Could you just repeat the last part of that, please? Mike Roxland : Sure. I'm just wondering -- no problem at all. I'm just wondering, if you're making any shifts in your business to account for some of the weakness that you're seeing in your end markets. And realizing that there is -- there are puts and takes with some of the inventory stocking durable items versus nondurable. So, meaning, if you're making any shifts in your business to offset those that weakness to capitalize on positive yield growth areas. Mark Sutton : Yeah. Okay. Appreciate that. Yeah. On the durables, it's really a very small part of our mix. And we're always looking -- we manage a very active S&OP process, and we're always looking at how we run our system. I would say that while demand softened a little bit as we went through the second quarter and our view is for it to be stable quarter-to-quarter, the supply chain constraints are real, and it's extending supply chains. And so part of the effort over the past years with those difficulties to get inventories back to a sufficient level, which may be elevated to historical levels. I mean, we're looking at four, five, six days additional time to move product between mills and box plants. So it's very dynamic at the moment. We're just trying to make sure that the inventory levels we have are sufficient for this type of service requirements that we have to our customers. Mike Roxland : Thank you. Good luck on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And next from Jefferies, we'll go to the line of Phil Ng. Please go ahead. Phil Ng : Hey, guys. Tim, I appreciate you highlighting the strength of your balance sheet and the free cash flow profile of your business. Just curious from a returning cash back to shareholders, which you guys have done a great job this year, how are you guys kind of balancing between stock buybacks just given where your stock is and then growing that dividend? And I guess, as we kind of look out to 2023, if there is a recession, your level of confidence of maintaining your dividend through a potential downturn. Timothy Nicholls : Yeah. Well, we want the dividend to be sustainable. That is first and foremost attractive, but also sustainable. So we take a look at it. We're just starting the process now. We look at it on an ongoing basis, but -- and more depth over the summer. And we usually, if there are any changes or if it remains the same, we communicate that in the third and fourth quarter. I think right now that's work to be done, and the conversation with our Board and our Board is very active in terms of how we how we think through total capital allocation. So there'll be more to come on that later. I think we feel good about share repurchases. We've tried to be very opportunistic. And yes, it's a powerful number that we've returned so far through six months this year. Mark Sutton : Yeah. Phil, if I could just add to Tim's comments, we really haven't changed the guidelines for our dividend after the changes in our portfolio. We still target the 40% to 50% of free cash flow, and we think that's the right amount. We continuously evaluate that with our Board. We listen to what investors have to say about it. What's different in our capital allocation, of course, is the ability to consistently at the right value have a share repurchase flow of cash back to shareholders. That's not episodic. It can be more consistent when it makes sense. The cash is there. And Tim talked about it in his prepared remarks around our ability to operate our system in different economic conditions. So wide open when it needs to be less than wide open and shedding marginal cost. And so when we think about potential downturns, there's always a question of how long and how deep. But just say a potential normal downturn, we have no concerns about the cash generation, the dividend or any of the real important capital allocation. Even CapEx, I mean, we've not been in a position to just say we're going to go and we're going to do what's right for the long term of the company even in a slowdown, and we feel very good about that right now. Timothy Nicholls : There are -- and I don't know if we're officially in a recession or not or what will come, but there are countercyclical benefits that offset sometimes downdrafts and economic activity, month for earnings and cash, when you think about input costs, so on the earnings side and you think about working capital on the cash side. Phil Ng : Super. And then, Mark, I mean, your point about how you guys have kind of retool the footprint and manage that fixed cost. Variable cost dynamic is important. It was actually my next question. Remind us if you had to take economic downtime to kind of keep the market balance, how should we think about that flow through? I mean, I think I have a pretty dated number, but I thought it was roughly in that $150 per tonne range if you had to take downtime to kind of keep things balanced. But give us an update that would be super helpful. Mark Sutton : I think that's still a reasonably good number. I mean there's obviously some noise in the variable cost side of given all the inflation. But I think that's probably still a good number from a modeling or planning standpoint. It obviously won't be exactly that, but it's in the neighborhood. Phil Ng : Okay. Super. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from UBS and the line of Cleve Rueckert. Please go ahead. Cleve Rueckert : Hey, great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. I don\u2019t want to split hairs here, but I did notice on the margins in Industrial Packaging, it looks like there was a slight change in the slides on the timing of that sort of 20% target, the 20% plus target that you're laying out there seem to be highlighted in the second half anymore. First of all, I'm just wondering if that was intentional. And if it was, given the pricing and the confidence in the Build a Better IP, how should we take that to mean that the ongoing cost inflation is just resulting in a little bit more uncertainty on the margin? Mark Sutton : Yeah. I think that we had more input cost pressure in the second quarter, and we see that continuing at a slower pace. But continuing in the third we think it does stabilize, level out as we go through the second half of the year. But I think it's just -- it's not anything more than just timing based on swift movement of inputs, and it takes a little bit longer to recover as we continue to implement the price increase. Cleve Rueckert : All right. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just following up quickly on the costs. The prepared materials, you say distribution stabilized at elevated levels. I think in the quarterly bridge, you talked about another $100 million of sequential headwinds going into Q3. I mean, just to clarify that. Ultimately, as you're thinking about it right now, does that -- when we're thinking about the bridge from Q3 to Q4, is that input cost sort of flat, which I think you're sort of alluding to, but just clarify on that. And then just be curious if there are any areas where you're starting to see costs release? Mark Sutton : Not significant amounts of cost release. It seems some things flatten out and moderate just a little bit as we went through the second quarter and now that we're in July. But I think the way that you framed it up is how we're thinking about it. We see some more input cost pressure at a slower rate of increase in the third quarter than we saw in the second. And then I think as we go through late third quarter through the fourth quarter, we see more stabilization at these elevated levels. Cleve Rueckert : All right. Thank you very much appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Then I will now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Mark Sutton, for closing remarks. Mark Sutton : Thank you, operator. And thank you for being with us today. As you could tell from our remarks and some of the Q&A, we're very confident and optimistic about the future of IP. We've reaffirmed our 2022 earnings outlook. We're making strong progress. We have a lot of momentum as we focus on Building a Better IP. We'll be at the upper end of that savings and earnings commitment for this year and we'll be well on our way into the targets we set for 2023 on that initiative. We've got a balance sheet and an overall financial strength of the company that we haven't had in a long time. That gives us a lot of flexibility. It also gives us a lot of ability to manage through the different economic scenarios that everybody is kind of trying to predict and plan for right now. We think we're ready for just about anything that can come, and we're going to perform very well through any scenario that we have in front of us. We think this all leads to our ability to really break through and accelerate value creation for our shareholders with a strong company, with a great employee team and the right -- and the ability to invest in the right ways without regard for any kind of temporary economic changes really positions us very well. So again, I thank you for your interest in International Paper, and we look forward to speaking with you again at the next quarterly update. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your participation in International Paper's second quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you'll have an opportunity to ask question [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mark Nelson, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mark Nelson : Thank you, Paul. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-US GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to US GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of our third quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. The third quarter was a very dynamic and challenging environment, which had a significant impact on our earnings. We experienced a sharp decline in demand in our Industrial Packaging segment and significantly higher cost headwinds from higher energy and distribution costs. On a more positive note, I'm very pleased with the progress our Global Cellulose Fibers team is making to improve performance in that business. They are successfully advancing their commercial strategy and achieved cost of capital returns in the third quarter. In both businesses, we also delivered strong price realization. And for the year, we expect to exceed our $225 million target related to our Building a Better IP initiatives. Now back to the demand environment. As we enter the third quarter, we recognized there were macroeconomic uncertainties ahead of us, and that our businesses are not immune to these risks. However, these macro trends shifted drastically midway through the quarter, creating stronger headwinds than expected versus our previous outlook, particularly in our Industrial Packaging business. Based on feedback from our customers and after observing order patterns across our various channels and end user segments, we believe inflationary pressures weighed heavily on the consumer, resulting in lower demand for goods. This had a large impact on demand for Packaging, as consumer priorities shifted towards nondiscretionary goods and services in the quarter. In addition, our customers and the broader retail channel continued to work through elevated inventories of their products, which further reduced Packaging demand in the quarter. In response to these trends, we quickly aligned our production with our customer demand, which resulted in significant economic downtime in the quarter for our Containerboard system. Also our significantly lower export position versus prior years' contributed to a higher level of downtime, all of which suboptimized our system from a cost standpoint in the quarter. I would point out that our mill system continued to operate very well before being constrained by lower demand. The work we did in the last several quarters to improve reliability is paying dividends. As we enter the fourth quarter, Packaging demand appears to be stabilizing at these lower levels. And finally on capital allocation, we returned $434 million to shareholders in the third quarter including $269 million of share repurchases. As a result, we've returned approximately $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders so far this year. If we turn to the third quarter in particular on slide 4, revenue increased by 10% year-over-year driven by strong price realization across our two business segments. Operating earnings and margins were lower than prior periods due to the significant macro headwinds I discussed earlier. However, our free cash flow generation was stable in the quarter. I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that, we are making good progress regarding Ilim. As I've mentioned before, the complexity of the situation and our joint venture structure impact the pace of reaching a resolution, but we feel good about the progress we're making and we'll provide another update when there is more information to share. I'll now turn to slide 5, which is one that we shared with you last quarter as we recognized that there were a lot of macro uncertainties ahead of us. Our outlook for the fourth quarter, which Tim will share with you shortly assumes our earnings will remain under pressure in the near term. However, I want to reinforce my confidence in the resiliency of IP, and our ability to navigate through these dynamic environments. Our teams at International Paper know what it takes to successfully manage through a business cycle. And given the rapid change in demand, it will take some time to realign and optimize our system to the current environment. We have a wide range of options and capabilities across our large system of mills box plants and supply chain. And we know how to leverage them while taking care of our customers. Also, later in the presentation Tim is going to share some specific actions that our teams are taking to shift production to our lowest-cost operations and shed high-margin cost across the system. We're also continuing to invest in projects to drive structural cost reduction through efficiency improvements. And finally, we have built a very strong balance sheet, which we will preserve because we believe it's ensuring our financial stability and optionality and is foundational to our company, especially in softer economic environments. This allows us to continue investing in our businesses, and to return cash to shareowners in a meaningful way by maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. I'm now going to turn it over to Tim who will cover our business performance and outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6, which shows our sequential earnings bridge. Third quarter operating earnings per share were $1.01 as compared to $1.24 in the second quarter. Price and mix improved by $151 million or $0.31 per share with strong price realization across both segments. Volume is lower in Industrial Packaging as a result of the softer demand across all channels. Global Cellulose Fibers demand was stable. However, pulp shipments were higher due to improved supply chain velocity. Operations and costs were impacted by the non-repeat of favorable one-time items in the second quarter, significant economic downtime in our Industrial Packaging business and higher distribution costs and other inflation across all businesses. As you may recall our operations and costs in the second quarter benefited from $96 million or $0.19 per share of favorable one-time items related to insurance recovery of \u2013 for our Prattville mill as well as lower employee benefit costs medical claims and workers' comp expenses. Maintenance outages were lower in the third quarter as planned improving earnings by $0.13. Input costs continue to be a headwind and were $75 million or $0.15 per share higher in the third quarter driven by higher energy and chemicals, partially offset by lower OCC cost. On slide 34 of the appendix, we provide details on our consumption of key inputs including natural gas, which was a significant cost headwind in the quarter for our businesses in North America and Europe. Corporate and other items include benefits from lower tax expense and a lower share count. Lastly, equity earnings were below the quarter prior primarily due to the lower sales price and FX related to Ilim. So turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on slide 7. We had very strong price and mix improvement in the quarter as we successfully completed implementation of our March price increase, while also benefiting from higher average export prices and commercial initiatives focused on margin improvement. As Mark mentioned earlier. the challenging macro environment resulted in much lower volumes and unfavorable cost in our North American and European Packaging businesses. Demand for Packaging weakened significantly mid-quarter across all channels and segments from lower consumer demand and retailer inventory destocking. This large decline in volume impacted operations and costs in the quarter as we adjusted our system to align our production with our customers' demand. These actions resulted in approximately 400,000 tons of economic downtime across the system, resulting in higher unabsorbed fixed cost and a sub-optimized system. This represented approximately one-third of the higher cost and ops quarter-over-quarter. In addition, when not constrained our mills ran very well, which increased the amount of economic downtime needed to match the reduced level of demand. Sequentially operations in costs was also impacted by significantly higher distribution costs, inflation on materials and services and the non-repeat of favorable onetime items we discussed in the second quarter. It also includes some additional spending on recovery boilers and bark boilers across our mills to make our own energy given the significant increases in natural gas prices. Input costs were another significant headwind in the quarter and much higher than we expected, primarily due to higher energy costs that were only partially offset by lower OCC cost. These cost headwinds are even more significant for our packaging business in Europe where natural gas prices doubled since the second quarter and averaged about nine times the normal level. Turning to slide 8. We thought it would be helpful if we share some additional perspective on underlying segment trends for our corrugated packaging business. As shown on the previous slide, our US box shipments were down 5.4% year-over-year and our overall US channel was down 5.9%. As a reminder, our US channel includes the US box system as well as our open market containerboard customers and our equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders. In the third quarter, we saw demand decline across all end-use segments. The yellow indicators represent segments where the demand decline was less than our overall average of 5.4%, and the red indicators represent declines that were worse than our overall average. Segments including beverage, durables and non-durables, which are more discretionary in nature, came under the most pressure as consumers had to make choices while dealing with high inflation. In addition, retailer inventory destocking has exacerbated. The demand decline is for most segments in the near term. Based on feedback from our customers and our performance in October, demand appears to be stabilizing at these lower levels, as companies continue to work through their inventories in the fourth quarter. Despite these near-term headwinds, we understand the critical role of corrugated packaging plays in bringing essential products to consumers and believe that IP is well positioned to grow with our customers over the long-term. Turning to Slide 9. As Mark mentioned earlier, in the softer demand environment where we are able to run our systems at full capacity, we have the ability to shed high marginal cost due to a wide range of options and capabilities across our large system of mills box plants and supply chain. For example, we are shifting between fiber options based on the marginal cost of wood versus OCC. In this case, our mill teams consider the total cost to process the fiber including the benefits from own-make energy when consuming wood versus the cost of natural gas used to process OCC. Another example would be in the supply chain area. Our teams are reducing premium freight through mode optimization and increased availability of lowest-cost carriers. At mills, we're working to lower our planned maintenance outage cost by reducing overtime and premium pay that is traditionally associated with the shorter schedule. We are also continuing to invest in our operations to drive structural cost reduction from efficiency improvements in the areas of fiber and energy consumption. Ultimately, we are focused on restoring margins to historical levels by aligning our production with customer demand while optimizing our cost structure. Turning to Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. I'll start with an update on the demand environment and supply chain. Demand for fluff pulp remains stable across all regions. Feedback from customers continues to indicate that fluff pulp inventories are near historical lows. We are experiencing moderate improvement in supply chain efficiencies. However, they continue to remain stretched driven by ongoing port congestion and vessel delays. We believe fluff pulp will continue to grow over the long-term and are confident in the essential role of absorbent personal care products and meeting consumer needs. Taking a look at the second quarter performance. Price and mix improved by $62 million due to the successful execution of previously announced price increases with solid momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. Volume in the quarter was higher due to some improvement in supply chain velocity. However, I would note that backlogs remain above normalized levels due to ongoing logistics challenges. Our mills continue to run well. Operations and costs were unfavorable in the quarter due to higher distribution costs and non-repeat favorable onetime items in the second quarter. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $26 million sequentially while input costs were higher by $12 million. Turning to Slide 11. Our Global Cellulose Fibers business continues to make significant progress towards growing earnings and delivering cost of capital returns in the third quarter. And the business remains well positioned to sustain this level of performance in the fourth quarter. Our team successfully deployed a commercial strategy focused on building strategic relationships with key global and regional customers and aligning with the most attractive regions and segments. We are focused on creating value for our customers by delivering products that meet their stringent product safety standards and deliver innovative value. In addition, we are driving structural margin improvement by ensuring we get paid for the value we provide.  To-date we have made solid progress in our fluff pulp contract negotiations which will provide additional commercial benefits as we move into 2023. We are committed to building on this momentum and delivering value-creating returns over the business cycle. I would also note that this is a key part of building a better IP initiative in the category of strategy acceleration. Turning to Slide 12, I would like to update you on Building, a Better IP set of initiatives. We're making solid progress in delivering $70 million of earnings in the third quarter for a total of $175 million year-to-date and we're on track to exceed the high end of our full year target.  About half of the benefits to date are from our lean effectiveness initiative by rapidly streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with a more simplified portfolio, we have already offset 100% of the dis-synergies from the Printing Papers spin-off.  Although most of these benefits have been achieved, we will continue to pursue additional opportunities. The process optimization initiative has the potential to significantly reduce costs across areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing as we leverage advanced technology and data analytics. These initiatives will deliver meaningful benefits in 2023 as we finish implementing new capabilities across our businesses. And finally strategy acceleration is about delivering profitable growth through commercial and investment excellence, getting our Global Cellulose Fiber business to deliver value-creating returns is one example of this. We are also focused on profitably growing our Industrial Packaging business by improving margins and investing for organic growth. Turning to Slide 13 and a look at the fourth quarter outlook. As Mark mentioned our earnings will remain under pressure in the near term given the current demand environment. With that I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix in the export channel to be lower by $10 million, volume is expected to decrease by $30 million with four less days sequentially in North America and the traditional seasonal pickup from holiday demand is not expected to be as strong this year. This will be partially offset by seasonally higher produce volume and EMEA packaging. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $120 million. A little more than half of this is from the higher unabsorbed fixed costs resulting from lower volumes as well as seasonally higher costs primarily from energy consumption and labor benefits. The remainder includes such items as inflation on materials and services and timing of spending, maintenance outage expense is generally flat. And lastly input costs are expected to decrease by $80 million from lower fiber and energy costs. In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to improve by $20 million on the realization of prior increases. Volume is expected to decrease by $10 million based on timing of shipments through the supply chain.  Operations and costs are expected to increase by $5 million due to seasonality while maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $34 million. Lastly, input costs are expected to increase by $5 million, primarily related to energy costs at our converting operations in Poland. Turning to Slide 14, I'll take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the third quarter. As Mark mentioned earlier, we have a very strong balance sheet, which we will preserve, because we believe it is core to our capital allocation framework. Our 2021 year-end leverage was 2.3 times on a Moody's basis, which is below our target range of 2.5 to 2.8 times. Looking ahead, we have limited medium-term maturities with about $1.3 billion due, over the next 10 years. And finally, even in this environment the risk mitigation strategies we've taken to ensure our pension plan remains fully funded have \u2013 are in place and are delivering. Returning cash to shareowners is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the third quarter, we returned $434 million to shareholders including 269 million through share repurchases, which represents 6.4 million shares or about 1.8% of shares outstanding. As a result, we've returned approximately $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders so far this year. In October, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases, which brings our total authorization to approximately $3.4 billion. Going forward, we are committed to returning cash through maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We are targeting between $900 million to $1 billion, which includes the funding cost for \u2013 the funding for cost reduction projects with attractive returns for strategic projects to build out capabilities and capacity in our box system to support future profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined and selective on assessing M&A opportunities that may supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging businesses in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must create compelling long-term value for our shareholders [ph]. And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim for all the details. Look, this is clearly a very dynamic environment with a lot of moving parts. As I look back across our company, I'm really proud of the improvement we've made in customer service over the last several quarters considering where we were in the middle of last year with Containerboard inventory issues and box plant availability for our customers. The reliability improvements we've made in our mill system both in Global Cellulose Fibers and in Containerboard, I feel really good about because we're running very, very well in some cases at levels \u2013 productivity levels that are the best we've ever run. I also feel good about the progress our Global Cellulose Fibers team is making and the trajectory of the profitability earnings and the business model changes we've made that Tim described a bit earlier. At the same time, I'm not at all satisfied with the level of our profitability, which has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, inflation and falling demand in the second half of this year. But I am certain, we will make improvements in this area. I'm also very certain about the resiliency of International Paper. During the past few years, we have significantly enhanced our financial strength and flexibility and taking a lot of risk out of the company. This strong foundation makes IP well positioned for success across a wide spectrum of economic environments. So with that operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bank of America and the line of George Staphos. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi. Thanks very much. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details, Mark and Tim. First question broadly on containerboard and the second one on pulp. So in containerboard, can you talk to us about what benefit you expect to get from the optimization efforts on a run rate basis, what the horizon would be in terms of when you expect to be at a more optimized level that you're targeting? And how do current box shipments and trends play into your optimization? And what are you seeing early in the quarter? Mark Sutton : So early in the quarter, we are seeing as Tim mentioned box shipments still stabilized from where they exited the third quarter that's down 6% or so from where quarter progressively got a little worse. I think George the issue on optimizing, which we have called in the past, variabilizing our cost structure. I think part of what's unique right now compared to maybe prior periods is the amount of production slow backs we're taking over a relatively short period of time and in a period where most of our maintenance out -- almost all of our maintenance outages are behind us. If you look at prior periods where we adjusted our output to match our demand; A, it was spread out more evenly. Some of it was in the first half of the year where we also had maintenance outages. So the third quarter, we did a lot and it was really in the last two months of the quarter. In the fourth quarter it spread out more evenly, but it's still trying to anticipate the demand that we think we see but being willing to turn it back on if the demand picks up. And so I think the fourth quarter is going to be a transitionary quarter. I will say from the last time we took economic downtime in our containerboard system in any appreciable amount, you will all remember that was 2019. If we look at the variable cost per unit of production in that environment, we're actually doing a little bit better than that. What's different this time is we're doing this in a really high inflationary environment. So the price part of a lot of our input is persistently sticky. We think some of that will start to relieve itself in the fourth quarter, but it hasn't all happened yet. We weren't dealing with that part of the cost component in 2019, but our teams know what to do. The goal right now -- we also didn't have a high energy environment then the goal right now is to maximize our own make energy as anybody who makes their own energy in any industry we'd be trying to do right now. But you've got to match that goal with the actual production output you need. And that changes the way we run our pulp mill. So I think we'll see through the fourth quarter continued improvement in how we shed those marginal costs. George Staphos : Thanks Mark. My other question on pulp. So you said I believe demand for GCF was stable yet your customers' inventories are still relatively low. You've seen some improvement, but not a lot I'm paraphrasing there in the supply chain. So with inventories low, did customers pick up their purchases relative to where they otherwise would have been, because they could access more material, because the supply chain has improved? And as we look out over the next couple of quarters presumably the supply chain improves, do you think that will lead customers to purchase more and improve their inventory position, or now that it will be much more hand-to-mouth, because supply chain has improved and so the need to have inventory will diminish somewhat? Thanks guys. Good luck in the quarter. Mark Sutton : I think the low levels of inventory for this particular type of product given it's not easily substitutable in the short term given the qualifications the low levels of inventory make the value chain very nervous. And so I think customers will work to get to some level of comfort that they're used to. I don't think anyone will trust the supply chain for quite a while to be the answer to, I can run with a lot lower inventories. Some of our shipments as Tim mentioned, or alluded to we shipped a little more than we expected partly because the supply chain velocity improved a little bit as you paraphrased. We don't know for sure if that's permanent or if that was just in the third quarter we hope it's going to get better, because it will help us lower our cost. But we still have the issues in the market. For example, China's market is still semi-closed with some of the lockdowns. We think the inventory situation is going to remain strained meaning low finished products throughout the value chain for the coming several quarters. And so we think that the demand is stable. It could improve, if China figures out their vaccine and all that strategy and maybe opens the economy a little more. But right now we what we see is stable demand going forward a lot of commercial improvements that will flow into 2023, and the ability with a little bit better supply chain to really start to take cost out of our system that we get to keep. George Staphos : Thank you, Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Citi and the line of Anthony Pettinari. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just following up on inventories maybe on the Containerboard side, how would you characterize customer inventories here in October as well as your own inventories? And to the extent that, there's maybe an overhang still in the channel? Like how long do you think it might take to work through that? Mark Sutton : So I think there's \u2013 if you go back to the slide Tim showed, Anthony, with the yellow and red segment descriptors. Those that were \u2013 the demand declined more than the average demand. Those are the customers in those segments. And we have very big customers national-type accounts and we have very small customers inside of each of those little segment descriptors. Those that were greater than the average a big portion of their commentary to us on their order pattern was too much inventory. And we think they think best they can tell from the consumer, I watched a few of their earnings calls earlier this week. That's a fourth quarter unwinding process, but maybe not terribly much beyond that. If you look at the other part of that chart where our decline in some cases we didn't break it out. But in some cases we had customers inside the segments that the demand didn't decline at all. And they're very big and important customers to us. And they would say, their inventories are a little high, but we'll see what happens with fourth quarter consumer demand. They're predicting a little less of a holiday pickup, but any pickup at all, and they'll feel like they're in great shape. So it's really a tale of those segments on that chart we showed. But even in the worst case we think most of our customers believe that this is working through the fourth quarter process. Obviously, you hate to make a prediction because there's so -- it seems to be so many variables that come up and inflation is still persistent and high. Consumer can be fickle after this holiday period and spending a lot of money on services, what happens to the goods market in the first quarter I think that's what a lot of us are trying to figure out right now. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just with the updated CapEx guidance, can you remind us kind of how you think about normalized maintenance versus growth versus regulatory CapEx to the extent that you're maybe trimming some of that maybe where is that coming from? And then understanding you're not giving guidance on 2023 just kind of directionally are there capital needs for the business that might cause CapEx to go higher next year? Could it go lower? Do you think you're kind of in a good position here? Just any incremental thoughts on CapEx? Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Great. Thanks, Anthony. It's Tim. So over time longer term, we look to have capital investment around the level of depreciation. It can be a little bit higher in some years. What usually drives that is not so much maintenance and regulatory. We try to keep that fairly consistent. We look over a five year period. We have five year plans about how we're going to do maintenance schedules. What tends to drive it up and down a little bit on the margin tends to be more of the strategic projects whether it's building out capability or more recently adding capacity in our converting operations. So -- but the $900 million to $1 billion is not necessarily us actively pulling back capital. It's just coming to the realization this close to the end of the year that as hard as we've tried all through the year supply chain has been a limiting factor about how much capital you can have installed and have it be productive in a given period of time. So that's the reason for the adjustment. Just acknowledging that we're not going to get as much done as we thought we were earlier in the year. And longer term, we'll try to be around depreciation. But where there's either good cost reduction projects or strategic needs building out capability, it could be a little bit higher than that in given years. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bank of Montreal and the line of Mark Wilde. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning, Mark, good morning, Tim. Mark Sutton : Hi. Mark Wilde : Mark, I wanted just to start out. You took a lot of economic downtime in the third quarter and you're suggesting more in the fourth quarter. I just wondered given that level of downtime and coupling that with all the new capacity that's coming into the industry over the next 15 months, are there some more efficient ways to adjust your capital base over the next 12 to 18 months whether it's some permanent moves, or maybe moves like we sought Valeant several years ago when they just mothballed one of the machines. Or is just continuing to take kind of rolling downtime across the system is that the optimum approach? Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Mark. I think the variables we look at of course, we don't know what the demand environment is going to be over the next year or two and we don't know exactly what the ramp of the new capacity you mentioned will be. So there's a lot of variables. The other thing that's a little different and a unique addition to the algorithm we use to figure out how to take downtime is one, we have very high natural gas costs which changed the competitiveness of your recycled mills and we have a few that are 100% recycled. The flip side of that is you've got a very expensive and congested supply chain. So an IP example would be our large recycled mill that's up in the Midwest might be a candidate to scale back for energy costs, but it defeats our ability to save on logistics because it's so close to the market. So one of the reasons you see us doing more of as you described rolling, so not fully shut them down but adjusting the output of multiple plants is to try to make all of that balance, get our integrated mills to be as close to energy independent as possible. And our nonintegrated mills, which tend to be located physically in places -- and they were built for that reason to be close to the end-use market and they're beyond a lot of the real choke points to get those to serve as much. As things change, as supply chain costs change, as energy changes, it will lead us to different conclusions. So that's how we make that decision on how much we run to our order book and where we do it. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then I wanted to just turn to sell. I know that this whole strategic effort in cellulose over the last few years has a number of different elements. And so just, if we look at the pulp price charts right now, they're at the highest level any of us have ever seen. So can you just help us on this call, get confidence that if pulp prices start to rollover, you're actually going to be able to maintain those cost of capital returns going forward in cellulose? So it's not just the market that's gotten you there at this point? Mark Sutton : Yeah. I think if you look at a couple of indicators, one of the things we've tried to do with our value proposition is to make arrangements with customers. Tim used the word moving to strategic arrangements versus just contractual volume for price. And two, how we participate in the different regions of the world given the nature of the product and what requirements a customer has from the standpoint of substitution and making sure we get paid for that. And so you can see some evidence in certain charts in certain regions where that phenomenon has already started to occur and there's no impact on our absorbent products economics. And the reason for that is our strategy adjustment has been to work with our customers and to basically have the effect of decoupling that as much as we possibly can. But your point is well taken. We will see how that plays out as we go through a normal business cycle. We're very comfortable that we've made structural changes in the way we go to market. And I'm not saying you won't see any cyclicality, but I think you will begin to see a different spread over time than you've seen in the past. But the proof will be in the coming quarters. I'll take you back Mark to what I've said over a year ago. Investors can expect with the changes we're making for Global Cellulose Fibers to improve quarter after quarter after quarter that we will be at the cost of capital returns in the second half of 2022. And that you could expect the business as we enter into 2023 to be a value creating business. And so far that's the track we're on. So let's keep talking about it quarter after quarter. I think your point is a great one, and I think it'll -- we'll learn a lot more about whether or not our strategy adjustments have resiliency and sustainability as we move into 2023. I believe they do. Mark Wilde : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Mark. I will turn it over to some other questions. Operator : Thank you. Next from Seaport Research Partners, Mark Weintraub. Your line is open. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. So I'm just trying to think through work out the downtime the magnitude of downtime that you guys took in the third quarter, obviously, acting quickly to adjust to the demand environment. And I think your North American system order magnitude's 13.5 million tons so roughly 3.5 million tons a quarter. And just the economic downtime itself was about 400,000 tons, which if I'm doing my math right and I'm not missing something is suggesting you're kind of in the 85%, 90% range in terms of operating rates. And basically, Containerboard production presumably was down by 10% plus year-over-year. So I have two questions on that. One, are you actually -- are you have you been bringing Containerboard inventory down in your system during this quarter? And then you also made the comments that you -- if I understood correctly that in the fourth quarter you're probably going to be taking as much or maybe more, did I hear that right? Mark Sutton : So Mark it's a multifaceted question. Let me just take you back to a higher level. So the Containerboard system has a certain capacity. It's a little higher than the number you mentioned. And the way we run it is not by quarter. I mean, we have to do what we have to do in a single quarter. The way we think about our system is we have a certain amount of output capability. We strategically target about 3% of that and you can look at our earnings calls from the past and how much volume we take out for planned maintenance ends up being around between 3% and 4%. Then there's another 3% to 4% that we tend to average just in terms of being flexible for customer service for unforeseen problems and so every once in a while to match a change in demand like 2019, we'll adjust our output to match a reduced demand environment. And that again has multiple variables. It depends on how strong the export market is during the same period of time sometimes the markets are connected sometimes they're not. That number as a percentage of our total capacity in 2019 was probably 6%, 7% of our total capacity once in a multiyear period. And I don't know what it's going to be. We don't forecast. We're just trying to match up the principle of we're going to make the Containerboard we need to serve the order book we have and to maintain what is much healthier inventories for our supply chain. And those numbers as you know for almost every industry are a little higher in this, kind of, supply chain environment. But that's the way you should think about it. Think about it big picture not in a 60- or 90-day period. There's a system, there's maintenance, there's flexibility time and occasionally there's an adjustment. And that's the, kind of, way it's going to play out. Roughly the percentages I gave you if you annualize -- what's unique about this and I mentioned it in the prior answer is a the market slowdown in quarters that normally the market is not slowing down and for IP in quarters where we don't have any other maintenance outages that would normally be taking production offline like we had in the first half of the year. So that's the difference is. That's what adds to the cost mitigation challenge. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Helpful. And just to -- and to clarify I guess what I'm trying to ascertain is whether or not the amount of downtime you took and I appreciate all the talk about maintenance and levels along those lines et cetera having an impact. But were you -- was there almost some catch-up on, if we were to remain in a down 6% type of demand environment, would you anticipate continuing to take this level of downtime or was there a degree of downtime on the Board side of things was even more than what the box shipment type of environment would have indicated? Mark Sutton : So again, Mark the way you need to think about the answer to that question is any downtime we take is a product of doing the analysis of our North American order book, our export order book, any maintenance outages that would already take production offline and I think Tim mentioned it, how well we're running in the moment. So we're running really, really well right now i.e. we're making too much containerboard which is where you want to be, that's what we worked on to be reliable.  What that means in plain speech is, the lack of reliability interruptions in the quarter which is a good thing, but not in a quarter where you necessarily don't need the production so you end up slowing back. But at least you didn't have a repair cost. So it's impossible to answer the question without knowing the answer to all four of those variables I just gave you. Mark Weintraub : That's really helpful. And I get I think basically you have improved your system you can actually make more products if you could continue like this which I guess would then sort of go back to Mark Wilde's question a little bit, is does that then give you a little bit added flexibility to think about your footprint on a different basis too if you've actually -- is that a fair observation? Mark Sutton : I think it's fair to think about the way I answered Mark's question is, in the moment where you're considering -- which let's take it right now if you look at the other variables like transportation and logistics costs and like energy costs and you make the decisions for production at the lowest, I think Tim used the word the lowest marginal cost operations and that could change in a month because of a hurricane that wets the Woodlands and now you've got high-cost wood at a mill that [indiscernible]. So my point is not to be invasive, it's a dynamic set of variables and we make those decisions not real time but enough -- a 7- to 10-day period. So if the answer to the question how do we make the production we need at the lowest cost involved some of the examples you and Mark mentioned then that's what we would do. But right now, with the variables we have, with supply chain and energy that's not the most cost-effective way to do it. Mark Weintraub : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Then our next question comes from Truist Securities and the line of Mike Roxland. Please go ahead. Mike Roxland : Thanks. Hi Mark, Tim. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up I guess on your inventory as well just following up on Mark's question and Anthony's questions about the overall -- the aggregate level of your inventories during the quarter. Can you give us a sense of where they stand? I mean I remember last quarter you mentioning that your containerboard inventories are now back to sufficient levels.  But with demand slowed aggressively that has given the economic downtime you've taken given some of the slowbacks would you be starting to say that your inventories have declined sequentially and relative to your comments from last quarter? Tim Nicholls : Yes. So we were back where we needed to be. Part of the reaction that you saw in the quarter. It happened midway during the quarter as Mark referenced, it was really in response to making sure that inventories don't get away from us. If we're linked to demand we're trying to look --- our S&OP process is trying to look at, not only in the moment but further out in time and what kind of product availability needs we're going to have. So, we were able to keep inventories in line with where we want them through the way we ran the system. Mark Sutton : And Mike again, I'll just reiterate the decisions that we make are for the, what we can see upcoming. But think about the calendar, the other variable as you're taking adjustments to inventory at this time of year, versus in the middle of the year as we enter into the first half of the year, which is our heavy -- 75% of our maintenance outages. So part of our normal operating strategy is to predict, how do we make sure we have the inventory we need in the first and second quarter of next year. So we don't lose a sale, because we did something to inventories in the moment in the fourth quarter, without looking at what's getting ready to happen. So that's factored into our decisions as well. It's not just about the inventory to manage the demand in the fourth quarter, it probably would be if we were in the second quarter because the outages are done. You've got plenty of inventory. You don't have any more mills down, but that's not the case here. We're getting ready to enter into our normal outage season and that factors into what we think we have to run, whether or not there was an economic slowdown or not so we can get through our outages. Tim Nicholls : Yes. The other thing, I would add is, even though we've seen some modest improvement in transit times with ocean vessels here on the ground in North America as well in truck. Our network, the supply chain has not picked up a lot of velocity. So, we're still dealing with the extra time it takes to move product in between mills and converting operations. Mike Roxland : Got you. I appreciate the color. And just one quick follow-up. If demand remains depressed through this quarter through the earlier part of next year, would it be fair to say that -- and you continue not to -- let's say, you could tell production their slowback is that the point at, which you would drag down your inventory? So Mark you mentioned it was 2Q. But would it be fair to say that if you were in early 1Q, and demand the overall demand volume is minus 6%, you would starting to draw down your inventories at that point? Mark Sutton : We would run the system to match the demand that we have. So, we don't know what the demand is going to be in the first quarter. But as we get closer to that, we'll have a better idea. And if that results -- and the supply chain velocity has improved, then we don't solve for the inventory level number. We solve for making sure, we can take care of our customers. And then we have the business prepared, because what we make today gets used in the future not today.  And so we've already made the inventory for it -- for today yesterday. So that's why it's difficult to give you a finite period answer. There's again, a lot of variables. We need less absolute inventory when the supply chain is flowing, than we do when it's not. And it's a long way from flowing and especially in the rail area, a lot of our mills are in the Southeast, deep Southeast where the rail choke points are not getting any better and the labor situation is not getting a lot better. So we're working with what we know right now. And what we know right now, says the inventory levels we have the absolute number, matches the slow velocity of the supply chain. If that changes, we'll adjust our production output to match the fact that the inventory is moving faster. So it's not a matter of where we lower our inventory, it's a matter of all of those variables lead to an inventory number. Mike Roxland : Got you. Appreciate all the color. Good luck for the balance of the year. Mark Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Then our next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Mark and Tim, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Mark just one more kind of way of asking that capacity question that I think both Marks were getting at is obviously you have to hazard a guess as to what long run demand will be to figure out what the optimal level of capacity is. And obviously, there is this exceptionally unusual surge in demand during the pandemic and now we're starting to see the other side of that. So, when you're thinking about the right amount of capacity to have long term how are you thinking about the right level of demand? Obviously, it's near impossible to forecast it. But are you thinking that 2019 levels were kind of normal or what the long run rate of demand growth will be? Obviously, there's capacity coming that I think Mark Wilde mentioned. So, how are you thinking about all those factors when determining what the right level of long-term capacity is for you? Mark Sutton : Yes. Again Adam I appreciate you coming at it from a different angle. I mean the long-term capacity we think we need is based on what we believe about the markets we serve and the markets we serve ex the pandemic just normalize volume unless there's some major change in the structure of the US economy. It's been a 1% to 2% growth market for boxes. And the open market is similar because we're selling to people who make boxes in the same market and global containerboard virgin containerboard to service the rest of the world and to create recycled fiber has been a 2% to 3% growth. And we typically try to position ourselves to have positions in those channels in the most profitable areas. And so I'd say right now again with those numbers in mind, over time not hearing the moment, but over time we're good on Containerboard. We just made the Riverdale investment in 2020. That was another good chunk of high-quality white top. We made small project investments across the North American system in years prior to that. And I think we've got the containerboard capacity we need. We're working on different grades lighter weights different things like that. But I think that's how we think about the containerboard capacity. We back it into what do we need in containerboard based on what we think the end-use markets are going to need for box which is the biggest. And then the actual open market we're selling North America and export. And those are the numbers we -- we didn't change our strategy because of the pandemic demand. What we did is we realized we can't run as close to the full capacity that we were running in our converting operations meaning you can always use a little labor to get some extra capacity by working some over time, but you can't do that forever because there's people and they can't do that forever. So, you do need to have a better asset strategy. And we learned that through the pandemic. We didn't change our strategy on what we look at long-term growth of containerboard and its uses. Tim Nicholls : No, it's just -- I think part of what you're getting at Adam is the pull forward that maybe some of the industry saw primarily around durable goods but durable goods is a small segment -- small for us a small in total. And a lot of what people are buying are consumable items. So, it's not like -- I don't -- maybe in some cases there's demand pull forward a little bit but I don't feel like that's the bulk of it. It's just I think we have seen the shift that Mark talked about between goods and services and that will normalize at some point too. Adam Josephson : Yes. No, I appreciate that. And just Tim one on the dividend. So, your balance sheet, you've done a lot of work to get it in much better shape than it used to be and kudos to you for that. When I think about the dividend payout, so just in light of what you're guiding to for this year the $900 million to $1 billion, if I assume that you sell or do something with your Ilim stake, that would mean that you wouldn't get that $200 million-ish of cash dividends next year and thereafter for that matter. Such that ex-Ilim you'd be paying out, I think what 90% of your free cash flow this year. And obviously you have a view of where trough cash flow is a normalized cash flow peak cash flow. How are you thinking about the dividend path in light of what you're guiding to for this year in light of what you're hoping to do with Ilim et cetera? Tim Nicholls : Yes. It's a great question, Adam. I mean, the way we think about it is -- and we say 40% to 50% of free cash flow that in our minds. And I think we've said this before. But that's not in every moment of time. That is through the cycle. And there have been moments when our dividend payout has been higher than that. And it's been right down on the bottom end of that at times too. So I think we're in a moment. But we still believe that the dividend is structured. We have bought back a lot of shares at the same time is still perfectly situated in that 40% to 50% of free cash flow. And we still believe in the resiliency of our cash flow overtime. Mark Sutton : Yeah. I think it's important to know Adam that, what Tim said is really, really important. 40% to 50% over a cycle, which means it's going to be at the upper-end. And it could be the number you just gave. And it could be much lower and be at the lower end it has even dipped into 30-something percent of free cash flow. But the dividend is really important to us. It's really important to our investors. That's what we hear from investors. And it is important for us to make sure that it's not a tactical thing that we calculate free cash flow for a given year and then we say oh 50% of that. That's not how we do it. It's 40% to 50%. It's an overall guideline through a cycle. And a lot of things happen to converge in trough conditions which you might describe as low demand and all its negative impact usually followed by lower cost environments unwinding of working capital. Cash as you know has many components but that's the way for people to think about our dividend. It's not a calculation in the moment pick your moment quarter half year, year. It's through a cycle. And I just want to be really clear about that. Adam Josephson : Thank you so much, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Then our final question for today comes from Deutsche Bank and the line of Kyle White. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just hoping to get some more details on demand. I know it's been talked about a lot, but I'm just trying to understand the two large dynamics impacting demand here the de-stock impact and no inflationary pressures on consumers. We kind of knew about the de-stock impact heading into the quarter but you mentioned that demand saw a sharper decline midway through. So it seems like inflationary pressures are now taking over and having a larger impact on demand going forward. So should that not carry kind of forward into 2023 such that, we could see mid-single-digit declines in the first half to 2023, or just what are you seeing now and how are you thinking about that for next year? Mark Sutton : Sure. Kyle, I think it's a really great question. That's the kind of conversation we're having with customers. Our business doesn't have that long of a cycle. So we got some visibility into the fourth quarter. It's really -- there's really not a lot of visibility other than algorithms and analytics into the first quarter. But what I think our customers said what they saw and then hence we saw is as inflation remains persistent customers had to make choices. They start -- and you look at the time of the year we're in approaching holidays a little more travel they're making choices to spend money on services or save money for a future airplane flight over the holidays and backing off some discretionary things. So fast forward through the fourth quarter and you flush out all that service spending where does the consumer find themselves in the first quarter? I think it has a lot to do with whether this slowing market and slowing economy actually creates different policy, interest rates. How does the consumer feel? You listen to the bank CEOs and they have a general view that the consumer is still in pretty good shape and that's true looking at bank balances and all that. But that won't stay that way if inflation remains at 9%, 10% and rents are high and all the other things. That's the real variables we're watching and our customers are watching. But we'll deal with whatever the environment is in the first part of next year. But I think we have to see what does the consumer do as they work their way through at least in this part of the world very heavily service-oriented holiday spending pattern and will they make choices that are different. It looks like they're making choices on less goods more services. But after the services are all spent will the goods -- replenishment. As Tim said, some of this is consumables will that be gained a normal cadence in the first quarter. It's a great question. We're watching it we'll know a lot more obviously as we go through the fourth quarter. And when we're talking to all of you at the end of January with our full year we'll be in it. So we'll have a lot better view on that. Kyle White : Got it. That's very helpful. And then what's the latest on Ilim? Understanding you can't share all the details, but just curious what you can on the call like this regarding the timing of potential sale that you think could happen there? And then also curious do you expect to receive any additional dividends from Ilim next year or in the future? Tim Nicholls : Yes. We're not forecasting dividends into next year. We're in the middle of the process. And you're right there's not a whole lot more we can say about it. But we feel good about where we are. We have made progress and we're pushing hard. Mark Sutton : It's -- I made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks, Kyle, that we're not where we were at the beginning of the quarter. We were much more advanced, but it is a complex process. The fact it is a joint venture and not wholly owned when you look at the process for executing strategic options under these current guidelines by both governments. The joint venture structure makes it a more time consuming and more complex process. But we have advanced along that time -- that process time line quite a bit. So I'm really pleased, but we're not there to be there. So that's why we're not getting out over our skis on where we are on it. But I feel really good about the amount of movement we made through the quarter. Kyle White : Got it. Thank you for all the details. Operator : Thank you. Then I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark Sutton for closing comments. End of Q&A: Mark Sutton : Thank you operator. I'd just like to close by really saying thank you to all the International Paper team members employees around the world what they're doing every day for our customers and what they're doing every day for each other. To stay safe and to operate in environments that I don't think any of them ever thought they'd be operating in and they continue to do an outstanding job. I'd just like to close by reiterating a couple of comments I made. We think the second half of this year is clearly transitory. We're taking the actions we need to take, pulling the levers we need to pull to make sure International Paper gets through this period in a very good way. And I'm really pleased with the kind of financial underpinnings we have entering into any type of economic environment. We have a lot of opportunity and flexibility even at lower demand levels. And in some cases, there could be a silver lining and the fact that it allows us to get some of our supply chain dysfunction back into a proper alignment. The strong balance sheet gives us options. So we can continue to make organic investments in structural cost reduction and in strategic capacity and capability. In the past we would have probably had to stop some of that, just to manage the balance sheet. There's no meaningful debt for the foreseeable future that we need to deal with. So we've got a lot of risk off the table. We're built for this type of environment and we're built for a strong environment. And I feel good about our ability to get through it. Look forward to talking to you with our full year call at the end of January. So thank you for your interest in International Paper. Operator : Then ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in International Paper's third quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Paul. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. And a reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3, where I will touch on our full year 2022 results. First of all, as I think about 2022, I'm very proud and appreciative of all the hard work our employees have done during the year. And for our strong customer relationships as we've managed through a very dynamic and uncertain market environment.  Looking at our performance. International Paper grew revenue and earnings driven by solid commercial and operational execution, while facing significant inflation and lower demand in the second half of the year. We also made solid progress in building a better IP. We delivered $250 million of earnings benefits from our initiatives, focused on lowering our cost structure and accelerating profitable growth. And as a result, we exceeded our full-year target and have strong momentum going forward. We're also confident in the profitable growth opportunities across our Industrial Packaging business and have made strategic investments to support this growth. We will continue to invest to grow earnings and cash generation by building additional capabilities and capacity in our U.S. box system during the next few years. I'm also pleased with the significant progress we made towards achieving value creating returns in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. We delivered $100 million of earnings growth in 2022 and we expect significant earnings improvement this year. This past year, we also returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareowners and our balance sheet is very strong. This allows International Paper to navigate the uncertain macroeconomic environment from a position of strength. And we believe it will give us opportunity to continue to invest through the cycle to grow earnings and cash generation while also returning cash to our shareowners by maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. Turning to our full year key financials on Slide 4. Revenue increased by 9% year-over-year, driven by strong price realization in our 2 business segments. Operating earnings per share improved by 32%. Operating margins were impacted by lower volumes from weaker demand for packaging and elevated supply chain and input costs. Overall, EBIT improved by about $300 million year-over-year. In terms of segment performance, both our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers segment contributed to our earnings growth by about $100 million each as our profit improvement initiatives and price realization offset significant inflationary cost headwinds. Our corporate expenses were also lowered by about $100 million, primarily driven by our building of better IP initiatives and some favorable FX. And for the year, we also generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow which was above our prior outlook, driven by higher earnings and improved working capital in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to comment on the press release we issued last week regarding the progress we are making related to our Ilim joint venture. We have entered into an agreement to sell our 50% interest in Ilim SA to our JV partners for $484 million. This transaction reflects a total enterprise value for Ilim of approximately $3.5 billion and approximately 3.1x EBITDA and the EBITDA multiple for 2022 full year results. The JV partners have also expressed interest in purchasing all of IP shares in JSC Ilim Group which represents a 2.39% stake for $24 million. We also intend to divest all other residual and nonmaterial interest associated with Ilim to our JV partners. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals in Russia. We are making good progress and will provide you with additional information when it becomes available. Upon finalizing this deal, IP will no longer have any investments in Russia.  Turning now to Slide 6 and our fourth quarter results. Earnings and free cash flow for the quarter were above prior periods and came in better than the outlook we provided last quarter. Demand for our products played out as we expected. In Industrial Packaging, our U.S. box shipments were down about 6% year-over-year on a daily basis, similar to what we experienced in the latter part of the third quarter, after consumer priorities shifted towards nondiscretionary goods and services. In addition, our customers and the broader retail channel continue to work through elevated inventories of their products which constrained packaging demand in the quarter. Underlying demand for absorbent pulp was stable. On a positive note, we did see meaningful relief from lower input costs and our fourth quarter earnings also benefited from our building a better IP initiatives and some favorable onetime items in the quarter which Tim will speak to later in the presentation. And finally, we generated solid free cash flow and returned $355 million to shareholders during the quarter.  I will now turn the call over to Tim to cover our business segment performance as well as our outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Great. Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7 which shows our year-over-year earnings bridge. Price and mix improved significantly with strong price realization across all channels and benefits from our commercial initiatives. Volume was lower in 2022 as consumers shifted priorities towards nondiscretionary goods and services while dealing with high inflation following a period of demand pull forward during the pandemic. Operating costs were negatively impacted by high inflation on materials and services and significantly higher supply chain cost across all of our businesses as well as lower volumes in our Industrial Packaging business. This was partially offset by improved mill performance and reliability. Maintenance outages increased as planned, impacted by high inflation on equipment, parts and contracted services. Input costs rose sharply across just about every category with more than half of the increase directly related to higher energy and fuel costs. Total corporate expenses and other items decreased by $0.33 per share as follows.  Corporate expenses declined by $0.19 per share and benefited from our building a better IP initiatives as well as some FX. Interest expense was lower by $0.14 per share, benefiting from significant debt reduction in the prior year. Tax expense was $0.20 higher per share with a normalized effective tax rate of 24% as compared to 19% in 2021. Lastly, share repurchases impact earnings by $0.20 per share year-over-year. Moving to the fourth quarter sequential earnings bridge on Slide 8. Fourth quarter operating earnings per share were $0.87 as compared to $0.83 in the third quarter. Price and mix improved by $0.06 per share from better mix in our Industrial Packaging business and additional price realization in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Volume was lower in Industrial Packaging as a result of softer demand across all channels. And Global Cellulose Fibers demand was stable. However, volume was lower sequentially due to higher pull-through of shipments in the third quarter as supply chain velocity began to improve. Operations and costs were impacted by the lower volume resulting in higher economic downtime and unabsorbed fixed costs as well as seasonality. Some of the downtime in our Global Cellulose Fibers business was caused by winter storm Elliott and also some isolated reliability issues. Ops and costs also benefited from favorable onetime items in the quarter related to lower employee benefit costs, workers' compensation expenses and medical claims. These favorable onetime items added about $71 million or $0.15 per share which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. Maintenance outages were higher in the fourth quarter as planned. As Mark mentioned earlier, we saw a significant relief from input costs which were $144 million or $0.31 per share lower in the fourth quarter, driven by lower energy and OCC costs. Corporate and other items includes benefits from lower interest expense, favorable FX and other corporate items, partially offset by sequentially higher tax expense. Turning to the segments and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 9. Price and mix improved in the quarter, primarily from commercial mix initiatives focused on margin improvement. The recent publication changes did not have a material impact on the fourth quarter. As Mark mentioned earlier, demand for packaging was in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter volumes remained at lower levels due to constrained consumer demand and ongoing retailer inventory destocking. Sequentially, volume was also impacted by 4 fewer shipping days. However, in this dynamic demand environment, International Paper is well positioned due to our diverse portfolio of products and services and our strategic relationships with a large number of national and local customers across a broad range of attractive end-use segments. Overall, our mill system ran well and we managed through winter storm Elliott very effectively. The lower demand environment impacted operations and costs in the quarter as we adjusted our system to align our production with our customer demand. These actions resulted in approximately 530,000 tons of economic downtime across the system, resulting in higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Ops and costs were also seasonally higher. However, this segment benefited from approximately $57 million of favorable onetime items, I mentioned earlier. Input costs were significantly lower and improved earnings by $139 million sequentially. About half of the benefit was from lower energy costs in North America and Europe and the remainder was primarily from lower OCC costs. Overall, we continue to face elevated supply chain costs as well as the impact from high inflation on materials and services during the past couple of years. In a lower demand environment, when we aren't running at full capacity, we believe there is a large opportunity to further optimize our system and take out high marginal costs. This remains a key lever in 2023. Turning to Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. Taking a look at the fourth quarter performance. Price and mix improved by $17 million due to the previously announced price increases. Volume was sequentially -- was lower sequentially due to higher pull-through of shipments in the third quarter as supply chain velocity began to improve. Operations and costs were negatively impacted by disruptions from winter storm Elliott and some reliability incidents at 2 of our mills. These were partially offset by approximately $14 million of favorable onetime items I mentioned earlier. Planned maintenance outages were higher by $39 million sequentially, coming off of the third quarter which represented the lowest outage quarter of the year. In addition, input costs were lower by $5 million. As we look forward, feedback from our customers indicate they are seeing in-transit inventory pull through at a faster pace due to improvements in supply chain velocity from last port congestion and improved vessel reliability. Combined with seasonal demand decline related to the Chinese New Year, we expect some customer inventory destocking to impact demand through the first quarter. With that said, fluff pulp inventories remain below historical levels and we believe fluff demand will continue to grow. This is due to the essential role that absorbent personal care products play in meeting consumer needs. Turning to Slide 11. Our Global Cellulose Fibers business continues to make significant progress, growing earnings and executing on our strategy to deliver value-creating returns over the business cycle. The business increased earnings by approximately $100 million in 2022 and was near cost of capital returns in the second half of the year despite significant supply chain cost headwinds. Our team successfully deployed a commercial strategy focused on building strategic relationships with key global and regional customers and aligning with most attractive regions and segments. We are focused on creating value for our customers by delivering products that meet their stringent product safety standards and deliver an innovative value. In addition, we are driving structural margin improvement by ensuring we get paid for the value we provide.  In the fourth quarter, we made solid progress in our fluff pulp contract negotiations which will provide additional commercial benefits going forward. We are committed to building on this momentum and expect to deliver significant earnings growth in 2023.  On Slide 12, I'd like to update you on building a better IP set of initiatives. We're making solid progress and delivered $75 million of earnings in the fourth quarter for a total of $250 million in 2022 which exceeded our target for the year. About half of the benefits today are from our lean effectiveness initiative by rapidly streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with our more simplified portfolio, we have offset 100% of the dissynergies from the printing paper spin-off. Although most of these benefits have been achieved, we will continue to pursue additional opportunities.  Another significant driver of full year results was strategy acceleration as we delivered profitable growth through commercial and investment excellence. Going forward, we continue to focus on getting our Global Cellulose Fibers business to deliver value-creating returns, we are also focused on profitably growing our Industrial Packaging business by improving margins and investing for organic growth. Finally, the process optimization initiative has the potential to reduce costs across areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing as we leverage advanced technology and data analytics. We believe these initiatives will deliver benefits going forward as we finish implementing new capabilities across our business.  Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions. As Mark mentioned earlier, we have a very strong balance sheet which we will preserve because we believe it is core to our capital allocation framework. Our 2022 year-end leverage was 2.1x on a Moody's basis which is below our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. Looking ahead, we have limited medium-term debt maturities with about $1.6 billion due during the next 10 years. And finally, even in this environment, our pension plan remains fully funded. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework.  In the fourth quarter, we returned $355 million to shareowners, including $191 million through share repurchases which represents 5.4 million shares or about 1.5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we've returned approximately $1.9 million of cash to shareowners in 2022. In October, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases. At year-end, our total authorization was approximately $3.2 billion. Going forward, we are committed to returning cash through maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash. We invested $931 million in our businesses in 2022 which includes funding for cost reduction projects with attractive returns and for strategic projects build out capabilities and capacity in our box system. As an example of this, the successful start-up of our new corrugated box plant in Eastern Pennsylvania which has an expected return on investment of 20%. And going forward, we plan to make additional investments across our box system to support long-term profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined and selective when assessing M&A opportunities that may supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging businesses in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must create compelling long-term value for our shareholders. So turning to Slide 14, we'll look at our first quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $65 million as a result of prior index movement in North America and lower average export prices based on declines in the fourth quarter. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $20 million due to 4 more days sequentially in North America, partially offset by the normal seasonal decline in daily shipments in North America.  Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $65 million due to the non-repeat of favorable onetime items in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect seasonally higher energy consumption and some additional inflation on materials and services. Ops and costs will also benefit from lower unabsorbed fixed costs due to higher volumes and more planned maintenance outages. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $91 million. The first quarter will be our highest outage quarter this year representing approximately 40% of planned outage costs in 2023. And lastly, input costs are expected to decrease by $70 million from lower average cost for energy, fuel and fiber. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to improve by million on the realization of prior increases. Volume is expected to decrease earnings by $15 million based on seasonally lower demand and customer inventory destocking and response to increased supply chain velocity. Operations and costs are expected to decrease by $30 million due to the non-repeat of favorable onetime items in the fourth quarter. In addition, ops and costs will be impacted by higher unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower volumes as well as seasonally higher energy consumption and some additional inflation on materials and services. Maintenance strategy expense is expected to increase by $13 million which is largely associated with the Georgetown mill printing paper out. This cost will be fully recovered as part of the transfer price to Sylvamo over the course of the year. Again, the first quarter will be our highest maintenance outage quarter this year, representing almost 40% of total planned outages in 2023. Lastly, input costs are expected to decrease by $15 million, mostly due to lower energy and fiber.  Moving to our full year outlook on Slide 15. We are projecting full year 2023 EBITDA for the company of approximately $2.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier in this presentation, we believe we have significant opportunities to reduce high marginal costs across our system and capture more benefits from our building a better IP set of initiatives. This includes meaningful earnings growth in our Global Cellulose Fibers business as a result of our commercial strategy execution, I would also note that our outlook includes only the impact from previously published price changes. Free cash flow is expected to be between $900 million and $1.1 billion which includes a onetime tax payment of $190 million related to our timber monetization settlement. In addition to free cash flow, we expect to receive approximately $500 million of cash proceeds from the Ilim sale. Regarding this transaction, for reporting purposes, the Ilim JV has been classified as discontinued operations. And in the fourth quarter, we took an impairment charge which was treated as a noncash special item. For 2023, we are targeting capital spending of between $1 billion and $1.2 billion with increased investments in our U.S. box system to build additional capabilities and support profitable growth with our customers. We will also focus on high-cost cost reduction projects across our system. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. Now I'll turn to Slide 16. I want to reinforce my confidence in the resiliency of International Paper and our ability to navigate through this dynamic environment from a position of strength. As Tim mentioned earlier, we're well positioned due to our diverse portfolio of products and services and our strategic relationships with a large number of national and local customers across a broad range of attractive end-use segments. Also, our teams at IP know what it takes to successfully manage through a business cycle by leveraging options and capabilities across our large system of mills, plants and supply chain to optimize cost while continuing to take care of our customers. In addition, our building a better IP initiative initiatives are focused on continuing to invest in projects to drive structural cost reduction through efficiency improvements and accelerating profitable growth. We exceeded our target in 2022 and we have solid momentum as we enter 2023. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we have significantly enhanced our financial strength and flexibility. This strong foundation makes IP well positioned for success across a spectrum of economic environment and to deliver profitable growth over the long term. And turning to Slide 17. As we look to 2023 and all of the dynamic conditions at hand, I draw confidence from an incredible milestone that reflects the resiliency of our company. To be precise, today marks our company's 125-year anniversary. On this date, in 1898, 17 pulp and paper mills in the northeastern part of the United States joined to form International Paper Company.  I think our founders would be amazed at how our enterprise has evolved through the years, including the incredible products we make and the expansive list of customers we serve. I would also appreciate our long-standing commitment to the pursuit of excellence in safety and environmental stewardship. While the world has changed, our commitment to providing essential products, people depend on every day and the talent and dedication of our team has not changed as we embark on our next 125 years. Our principles and resilience will continue to serve us well. I'm excited about how we are reengaging our company. We haven't performed to our full potential but that's behind us. We are committed to take our performance to a higher level. We recently made talent and leadership adjustments to match the right skills to the right opportunities we have in front of us. It's the right team to execute our strategy. We continue to make a lot of traction on our build to better IP focus areas.  The things we're going after will set us apart and will drive our results. In essence, we are proud and well positioned to build on our 125-year legacy in the days, months and years ahead. I'm confident you'll like what you see. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Wells Fargo Securities in the line of Gabe Hajde. Gabe Hajde : I had one specific one on, I guess, energy use. And when I look at kind of the sequential math and what you guys kind of beat by in the quarter, I'd say at least in the corrugated or Industrial Packaging segment, half was from these one-timers and maybe half was from lower natural gas. Has anything changed kind of with your -- so I guess, first question is, can you confirm that? And second, has anything changed with IP's perspective on mediating risk kind of across the organization given geopolitical tensions and potential impact on commodity inputs? Mark Sutton : I think you sound like you got it about right on the split between the one times which usually get corrected in the last quarter. But through a lot of efforts, especially on things like the medical cost and all of that. On the question about energy and geopolitical, I mean, part of the reason we have lower energy cost is our energy usage can be optimized actually when we're running less than full capacity because a higher percentage of our energy is our own make energy. And so we can actually just stop consuming purchased -- as much purchased energy whether that's raw natural gas to power the auxiliary boilers or whether it's the electricity we buy that we don't make ourselves.  Our view on geopolitical is no better or worse than anyone else's. As we look out ahead, part of it is what's happening with weather and what's happening in Europe in terms of demand for some of the fuel, natural gas being the main one. We feel like it's a more stable environment going forward. But what we've been able to do is really manage and optimize our consumption. And as you know, Gabe, in the integrated mills, at the right output level, we are generating from wood biomass fuel most of our own steam to generate most of our own electricity. Not that we don't want better demand but when it is lower, we can optimize our energy profile which is what we're doing. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then, I mean, if I take Tim's commentary, I think, directionally, maybe implied EBITDA for the first quarter is somewhere in that $540 range which obviously suggests a pretty significant ramp to get to your full year outlook. I wanted to know if you'd be willing to parse out, I think the term used was significant improvement in Global Cellulose Fibers, if you maybe put a finer point on what's implied there.  And then I appreciate, again, some of the maintenance costs are somewhat front-end loaded but -- so we've got visibility there. But then it sounds like a lot of this improvement in the back half maybe or as the year progresses is based on your ability to run more efficiently and take these costs out that seemingly kind of crept into the system and to use your words, Mark and you guys were kind of not pleased with the performance necessarily. So just maybe the building blocks of how you think about maybe magnitude of getting to that full year number? Tim Nicholls : Gabe, it's Tim. And I think you actually summarized it quite well. We are front-end loaded in the first quarter on maintenance outages, so we get a step down. If you look at it on average across the quarters 2 through 4. But really, the benefits to GCF come through, the contract negotiations that were closed in the fourth quarter. And so we're going to see a step-up in profitability based on those. And then given build a better IP and what we expect to achieve this year and just flowing back some of these marginal costs. I mean the past 2 years have been -- the costs have been going up almost relentlessly across every category. Supply chain cost has proven to be a little bit stickier. But we think both from a rate and fuel standpoint, there could be an opportunity. But the real opportunity for us is just on the operations side, just getting back to more of a normalized mode mix type of scheduling of transportation and taking out the premium freight and higher marginal supply chain and logistics costs to move product to customers. Operator : Next we go to Bank of America in the line of George Staphos. George Staphos : Congratulations on the quarter. Much better than we were looking for. One thing first point of clarification for Cellulose Fibers, did you say price and mix in the quarter would be a plus 5-0 or plus 1-5? I couldn't quite tell. Tim Nicholls : Sorry about that, plus 1-5. George Staphos : Okay. So I wanted to piggyback on Gabe's questioning on GCF. Again, to the extent that you can provide a bit more color, what else do you have embedded in the discussion on a significant improvement? I take from your comments that you're assuming current levels of pricing, you're not really making a forecast, at least internally on the direction of pricing? Or are you? Anything that you could provide us there? Anything that you could provide us with the current snapshot, right, in terms of cost and operations, what you might see in terms of a profit delta, '23 versus '22? Tim Nicholls : I'm sorry, I missed the last part of that, George. I mean I think it's no different than what I was just talking about with Gabe. We got big structural changes in the contract negotiations in GCF in the fourth quarter. So that hits now. That starts as we go through first and second quarter. And then just in terms of most of the initiatives their internal self-help, whether they're structural through a build a-better IP or they're just getting back to more normalized levels of operation across a number of categories including supply chain, usage in the mills on inputs and the like. So we're not immune from the macro environment but there's a lot that we think we have in front of us that we can work on, especially as it relates to the marginal cost that were incurred in a more run full type of environment. George Staphos : Would it be fair to say, Tim, if I just very simplistically annualize what you're seeing in industrial packaging on price mix as kind of a headwind you need to manage against that GCF to basically close the gap as maybe a couple of hundred million dollars or better profit-wise in '23 versus '22? Ex any changes in pricing in the market? Tim Nicholls : Order of magnitude, yes, it's close... Mark Sutton : George, this is Mark. I think that's a good way to think about it, although they're not the same market be the numbers work out. There one way to just verbalize what you should be thinking about with Cellulose Fibers, a lot of commercial changes on all types of accounts and customers and regions of the world occurred through 2022. And those benefits now are largely locked in, in our commercial agreements for the full year 2023, coupled with improving our cost position. So that's where the expansion comes from, commercial is the driver, layered on top of a much more sane higher-velocity supply chain and lower cost structure. And that gets you the significant earnings improvement. George Staphos : Make sense. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. One related to the GCF and then one to the industrial packaging business. So for GCF, Tim and Mark, you mentioned that inventories are low. You believe at your customers' levels, I thought you said but also that there is a potential for destocking in the first quarter. So can you help us reconcile those 2 points? And then in industrial, as you're bringing on the Pennsylvania box plant and as you have been targeting potential other converting investments. What are the implications? And how are you managing against the -- what the implication for the rest of your box business? And how do you keep retention at high levels as you perhaps adjust your converting footprint in any given region, including in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Tim Nicholls : George. Yes, on the inventory side, it's a combination of 2 things. So we believe inventories are historically low. They've been that way for the past couple of years. But you've got a little bit of a phenomena going on with the accelerated velocity in supply chain through the third quarter that people were able to recover a little bit but still not get back to what would be historical levels of inventory. So they've got a little bit more to work with but they're low on a historical basis and then we believe once you get through Chinese New Year, buying picks up again. So on GCF, the labor issue, yes, that's been a battle through '22 but the business is deploying a lot of strategies there. Mark Sutton : George, the way to think about the example of the Pennsylvania box plant coming on and then with obviously a softer demand environment. I'll take you back to the last maybe 3 quarterly calls where I commented on our running to meet demand required structural over time in a lot of our plants. And so in that particular part of the country, we are -- we don't have enough capacity even with our employees working a fair amount of overtime. So this plant is going to help us not only gain business, we've had to turn away in some places but stabilize the entire region of plants around it by getting onto a more sustainable operating schedule for our employees. So customer retention because we're stretched on our capacity. And it's not an average statement. It's in different parts of the country. This is one of them. This will actually have benefits from the incremental volume of the plant and secondary benefits by stabilizing the nearby operations into a more sustainable schedule. So I think we feel really good. It's a total net add and an improvement in our operating cost and our operating efficiency and our employee resiliency. So we've got several other examples in different parts of the markets where we're going to be doing the same thing. Operator : The next from Seaport Research Partners, the line of Mark Weintraub. Mark Weintraub : So 2 quick questions. One was on the cellulose fibers, with the changes that you're making, do you think that pricing beyond 2023 is going to be less impacted by shifts we see in PPW, for instance, is it kind of -- are these more fixed? Or are we still going to be moving quite a bit with where the open market transactions are going? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean it's -- so Mark, it's Tim. I don't want to start making forecasts or predictions but we do believe, as we've said, that the business is structurally taking efforts to get paid for the value that they're delivering. And you do have a mix across the different channels and segments that we serve. This last piece that we referenced in terms of the contract negotiations in the fourth quarter were structurally something that needed to be corrected by the business and it took a little bit of time to do it. So not making a prediction but we believe that the actions that we're taking consistent with how we get paid for value. And so you can read into what you think that means as we go through '23 and '24. Mark Weintraub : Okay. So I guess I'd read that hopefully, it leads to reduced volatility. Is that a fair -- that's the intent of the contracts? Tim Nicholls : Well, I think it's the intent of the approach that we've taken with each of our customers and just recognizing that the value equation doesn't change dramatically over time. Mark Sutton : Mark, I think it's fair to say our commercial objective is to improve profitability, as Tim just described and there's multiple ways to do that depending on the segment and the type of customer. And then secondly, obviously, to reduce volatility in the way that we make When we throw words like strategic customer relationships, that's partly what we mean by the word strategic versus transactional that there is a longer-term view which usually comes with less volatility versus playing a very transactional market by the month or by the quarter. you need probably a mix of all of it but our objective is to improve profitability which we are doing and reduce volatility. Mark Weintraub : Understood. And then just quickly on the Industrial Packaging, when you talked about volume, you talked about the 4 more seasonal days. You talked about the seasonality typically being a negative, of course. Now are you not seeing any signs that maybe the destock which negatively impacted the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter by your customers. Any signs that we may be getting towards an end? And might that become a positive? Or any indications from customers as to when that might start working less against you? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I think that's right, Mark. A large portion was taken care of in the fourth quarter. It feels like maybe there's some remnants but that it's getting close to the end. And if you look at where we are just in January, year-over-year, it looks like we don't have numbers yet but just following cut out. It looks like we're down 5% year-over-year but stabilizing from fourth to first. Operator : Then next, we go to Truist Securities in the line of Mike Roxland. Mike Roxland : Tim and Mark, congrats on a very good quarter. Last quarter, you mentioned you had an internal algorithm you used to figure out how and where to take downtime. And then one of the items that you -- as part of the algorithm is natural gas. So with the domestic natural gas down as much as it has been with the decline in OCC? How have you shifted your downtime plans, if at all? And just trying to get a sense of whether you've been able to more efficiently take down time and whether that was a benefit in the quarter as well. Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Mike. We shifted it to the algorithm for marginal cost. And so that's one of the important one, also logistics and transportation costs which haven't relaxed as quickly is an important one and then, of course, fiber, wood fiber costs as well as OCC. And I would say, yes, you saw more of our production shift to the lower-cost energy mills but not in a material way. We ran everything. We didn't make any dramatic shifts but you can see the efficiency and cost reduction showed up in our numbers. Because, again, as I said, at certain sweet spots in an integrated mill where you're making at full capacity, 80% of your energy at less than full capacity you can make almost all of your energy and you're not subject to the open market for purchase electricity or gas virtually at all. So that might even trump a lower gas price. When you have a mix of integrated mills and recycled mills like we do. Mike Roxland : Got it. And then just quickly on China. With the country easing its strict Zero-COVID policies, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing from a demand perspective in GCF? And I know it's early stage and I know that you're also contending with Chinese New Year, so you may not have your line of sight. But any early read on how demand may or may not be impacted from the elimination of those policies? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I think it's probably a bit too early, although we agree that there is an opportunity past Chinese New Year, China reopens, we see that as a positive. Operator : Then next, we go to RBC Capital Markets in the line of Matthew McKellar. Matthew McKellar : First, I just wanted to ask around the sale of your stake in Ilim. Are you able to talk about the time line to close that transaction. It sounds based on your guidance that you're looking for it to close this year. But -- is there any additional color on that? And also any thoughts on key hurdles to clear in terms of receiving regulatory approval. Tim Nicholls : I mean I don't want to speculate such a fluid environment but I think we look to closing sometime this year at the regulatory approval process, will take what it takes. So as we know more, we'll report it. Matthew McKellar : Okay. And then just in Industrial Packaging with linerboard medium prices, we see benchmark prices coming down. Can you just remind us to what degree your typical kind of contract pricing lag on realization would be versus those benchmark prices? Tim Nicholls : Yes. It usually runs a couple of quarters. It's all over the map. But when you look at it in total, on average, usually see it coming through over a 2-quarter period. Operator : The next, we go to Cleve Rueckert of UBS. Cleveland Rueckert : Just a couple of follow-ups for me. I guess, firstly, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had a comment about taking out high marginal costs. And obviously, you've been pretty dynamic about that over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity for some more permanent restructuring in the containerboard system, if that's something you're considering or sort of remains dynamic right now? Mark Sutton : If you mean -- this is Mark. Thanks for the question. If you mean permanent, like adjustments of capacity, we don't see that on the horizon. Given the types of products we make, the different grades, cost structure of our mills. We're quite capable of running at 105% of nameplate rating and 85% of nameplate rating. And we do believe long term, fiber-based packaging market is growing. So structural cost reduction, where we can now say it's worth making a capital investment to take out this permanently, this marginal cost that ends up only coming out when we are taking economic downtime. Yes, there's opportunities for that. But there's no consideration right now or any major adjustment in our asset base because it's very competitive; it makes the products we need. And I think we've got to figure out also industry in general and I think in particular what's the new normal in supply chain because location of facility near -- converting or near market matters a lot more now than it used to. So we've had a lot to figure out on that but lots of cost reduction opportunities through modest capital investment would be our focus on taking it out for good. Cleveland Rueckert : Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And I was just wondering if there is any -- if you've made any discoveries through the process of being more dynamic over the last couple of quarters but it sounds like that's a work in progress. Maybe just 2 more quick ones. You've laid out full year guidance. I'm just wondering if there's any economic downtime built into the plan that you've laid out or if it's mostly maintenance in Q1? Tim Nicholls : Yes. We don't comment on any plans we have or don't about economic downtime going forward. But we have a view of the market growth and how we'll need to run the system as we go through the year. Cleveland Rueckert : Okay, that's fair enough. And then just finally for me, thinking a little bit bigger picture. I'm just curious, I'm just sort of wondering conceptually here, how frequently you evaluate through cycle free cash flow. I think it looks like you need about another $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow to support the dividend within that 40% to 50% payout that we've talked about before. I'm just curious how you plan to get there from here just on a conceptual basis. Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean we look at free cash flow through the cycle. We do trough testing around sustainability of the dividend. I mean, we feel very good about our ability to meet the dividend requirement. And the 40% to 50% is not a hard and fast rule that it will always be within that. Sometimes it could be a little bit above and sometimes it might be a little bit below. But over time through the cycle, we think averaging 40 to 50 across a number of years is an appropriate range to shoot for. Cleveland Rueckert : Would you say that CapEx is running like a little bit above average in '23? I mean is that something we should expect to come down. Tim Nicholls : I think it's within $100 million or $200 million, it's probably in the zone. I mean we were trying to spend more on last year but just given supply chain difficulties and long lead times, it was impossible. And so we were just short of $1 billion last year. We're targeting between $1 billion and $1.2 billion this year. But again, it depends on suppliers and vendors' ability to deliver within a time frame. But D&A runs about a little over $1.1 billion. We've looked at average that over time in terms of capital spending. Operator : Then next from Jefferies, we go to the line of Philip Ng. John Dunigan : This is John Dunigan on for Phil. Congratulations guys on a great quarter. I wanted to first ask about the containerboard inventories for IP. Where are they now? I mean, one is your base maintenance outage but do you see them in a decent spot with kind of this continuing weak demand environment? Or do you actually see the need to build up a little bit just because of 1Q being your largest maintenance outage? Tim Nicholls : Yes. I mean without getting into the numbers, they came down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We're going into heavy maintenance outage season, first quarter for sure but in the second quarter. So we'll look at inventories and make sure that we are at an appropriate level to support our outages. So -- but I don't expect a lot of movement. John Dunigan : Okay. And then just with the new capacity for the industry that's coming online, have you seen any impact from that? Any businesses coming up for bid more frequently or anything along those lines? And just in terms of how IP is maybe responding to all the capacity that's heavily coming on here in the latter half of the quarter. Have you been able to lock in any customers for a longer period of time or kind of shore up some of your contracts to avoid some of the potential instability in the supply demand? Mark Sutton : John, I think the way we think about it is our containerboard and box system obviously, is an integrated system for the board that we use to make our boxes. And the balance is what we would call our open market position. There's 2 pieces to that : domestic market and export market. And for the domestic market, all of our customers that buy board from us are long-term strategic agreement type customers. We do very little in just kind of what would be considered a spot market. And so we really don't have some of that churn issue that you're talking about. And then we look at demand for virgin kraft linerboard which is all that we export and we oscillate our output on that to match the demand signal. So we've seen capacity come on in the past and it comes on in varying degrees of velocity and varying degrees of success. And we'll just navigate this one like we've done in the past. But we really do run -- for all practical purposes, we run a pretty integrated operation from fiber to box, whether we're making the box or whether a long-term strategic open market box makers making it. John Dunigan : Okay, understood. And just one point of clarification. In the deck, it says there's no dividend expected from Ilim in 2023. I mean given the closing, it was just expected sometime this year, is there no cash dividend that could come from just holding on to the Ilim for longer portion of this year depending on the closing? Or that's kind of off the table included in the sale price? Tim Nicholls : Yes, that wouldn't be base case. We don't expect it. Operator : The next from Deutsche Bank -- I'm sorry, from KeyBanc, Adam Josephson. Adam Josephson : Just couple of questions about your -- the assumptions embedded in your full year guidance. One on demand, I think, Tim, you mentioned you're thinking underlying box demand will be flattish sequentially 4Q to 1Q. Could you talk about what your expectations are thereafter? Just given the destocking that you talked about affecting the fourth quarter, one would think that demand would be getting better sequentially at some point over the course of 2023. So just wondering what exactly your expectations are beyond 1Q and for full year shipments '23 versus '22, if you're able to talk about that. Tim Nicholls : I mean we do see a modest recovery. I think we're looking at something in the neighborhood of maybe 1% absolute over the course of the year. So as we get out of the first quarter going into the latter part of the year, a pickup is anticipated but modest. Adam Josephson : Got it. And on price, Tim, just given the lags you mentioned with respect to when the previously published price changes hit your P&L, is it reasonable to assume that your realized prices in Industrial Packaging will fall sequentially not only from 4Q to 1Q but also from 1Q to 2Q? I would assume so but I just want to confirm that. Tim Nicholls : Yes, I think that's reasonable. Adam Josephson : Okay. And my last question is just if I think about the implied 1Q guidance, I think, around $530 million, maintenance will be higher by about $120 million compared to the latter 3 quarters. So if I take the $530 million, I'd go up to $650 all else equal, if you assume the last 3 quarters of that, you get to about $2.5 billion for the year. So obviously, there's additional improvement embedded in your guidance, I assume from higher realized pulp prices or otherwise. So you're assuming that even though prices in Industrial Packaging will likely be lower from 1Q to 2Q and thereafter. Is that -- I just want to make sure I'm clear on the moving parts from 1Q onward. Tim Nicholls : It all sounds reasonable. Adam Josephson : Got it. And just last one for me is what are you -- what is your sense, Tim or Mark, as to how -- the extent to which the customer destocking has played out in terms of box demand? Do you think you're 90% of the way there? 70%? What are you hearing from your customers as to what their inventory levels are and their expectations are? Mark Sutton : I think, Adam, we're hearing -- there is a range but we're hearing, as Tim, I think, mentioned in the earlier question, a large portion of the destocking did occur in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of segments that are maybe still going through it. But in some cases, we've had orders pick up in certain segments to kind of replenish inventory. So it feels like based on what we're hearing qualitative and what we're seeing in order book that the destocking story of demand chain played out largely.  And now the question mark on everybody's mind is what does the consumer do as we move through the first half of the year with respect to disposable income, what happens with inflation, they're getting some relief on fuel prices and does the consumer move back into the goods economy. And more than likely, everybody who looks at it will get it wrong and it will probably come back faster or it will take longer to come back but we won't get it precisely right but that's what we're hearing. Operator : Our last question will come from Citi in line of Anthony Pettinari. Anthony Pettinari : Just a couple of quick ones. Maybe following up on Adam's question on the outlook. I think over the last few years, when you've given a full year outlook, you've given kind of a range of $300 million EBITDA. This year, you're giving $2.8 billion which is maybe a bit more of a specific number. I'm just wondering if there's sort of a different way that you're formulating or presenting the outlook is 2.8 million kind of an internal target? Or how do you think about sort of upside, downside there? Tim Nicholls : Anthony, it's Tim. We said approximately $2.8 billion. It could be a little bit higher or a little bit lower is just a dynamic environment and we think it will be around that $2.8 billion level. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. And then you talked about lower fiber costs in the 1Q outlook slide. I was wondering if that's just a function of seasonality or if you're seeing real deflation or maybe price declines there. And then I was just wondering if you're seeing any uptick in OCC? And if you could just kind of comment on Southern virgin fiber costs, understanding those are kind of local markets. Tim Nicholls : No. I think it's OCC and virgin fiber, we're expecting to be down modestly. You've had a lot of transportation cost impact on -- really on both. But on virgin fiber and our inventories are in good shape. And so we think we have an opportunity to bring virgin wood cost down slightly as well. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Sutton for closing comments. Mark Sutton : Thank you and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Just to kind of wrap up with a couple of key points. We're excited about 2023. We believe in our outlook. We've got opportunities to maximize our performance in this uncertain environment. A lot of opportunity to get our cost structure back to something that we would consider more normal on different cost ratios. And then, looking at the commercial improvements we are making throughout 2022 and into 2023, we expect to see dividends on improving our profitability regardless of the demand environment and then the investments we're making are primarily in our box system, we'll continue to make those and we will be ready with a more sustainable operating model when demand returns to a more normal level with the appropriate level of converting capacity and capability in the right geographic locations. So a lot to do. We're excited about it and we look forward to updating you along the way. Thanks for joining our call today. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for your participating in today's International Paper's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on slide two, including certain legal disclaimers.  For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the first quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide three, where I will touch on our first quarter results. Let me begin the discussion by saying how proud and appreciative I am of all the hard work of our employees and for our strong customer relationships as we manage through a dynamic and challenging macro environment. Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered $65 million of year-over-year incremental earnings benefits from our Building a better IP initiatives. And our mill system continued to perform very well as we successfully executed our highest planned maintenance outage quarter of the year and continued to optimize our system while taking care of our customers. On capital allocation, we returned $319 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $157 million of share repurchases. We continue to navigate a challenging demand environment as our customers and the broader supply chain work through elevated inventories of their products. We also believe consumer priorities remain focused on services, as well as non-discretionary goods, which has been influenced by inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and the pull forward of goods during the pandemic. Margins were also under pressure from lower prices across our portfolio, partially offset by additional benefits from lower input costs. Now, I'll turn to slide four and talk more about the current operating environment, as well as our ongoing commitments going forward. As we entered the year, we recognized there were macro-economic uncertainties ahead of us, and our businesses are not immune to these risks. These macro trends shifted in the quarter, resulting in a weaker than expected demand environment through the first part of this year. Much of this was influenced by greater inventory destocking across the whole supply chain, weaker export markets, and unfavorable weather impacts on the fresh produce segment. In addition, lower prices across our portfolio today have put additional pressure on margins relative to what we expected in our full year outlook. Although we believe most of the destocking through the retail channel has been resolved, destocking continues throughout the rest of the supply chain, especially with manufacturers and many of our customers. We believe this will run its course through the second quarter, resulting in an improved demand environment in the second half of the year. I want to reinforce that our teams at International Paper know what it takes to successfully manage through a business cycle by leveraging the wide range of options and capabilities across our large system of mills, box plants and supply chain, to really variabilize our costs while continuing to take care of our customers' needs. We demonstrated our ability to do this in prior business cycles, and our ongoing commitment is to continue operating our company the IP way. We remain focused on our key priorities of taking care of our employees, our customers, and maximizing value for our shareholders. This includes preserving our strong financial foundation and maintaining our dividend.  Before I turn it over to Tim, I also want to provide an update on Ilim. We have made good progress toward closing the sale of our Ilim investment. Buyers received an important required approval from the Russian sub-commissioned overseeing exits by foreign companies, but we are still awaiting the approval of the Russian competition Authority. We are optimistic that this final required approval will be received soon and we plan to close shortly thereafter. I will now turn it over to Tim, who will provide more details about our first quarter performance as well as our outlook. Tim. Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Turning to our first quarter key financials on slide five, revenue was down slightly versus prior periods while operating earnings per share came in above prior year, and better than the outlook we provided last quarter. Operating margins in the quarter were impacted by weaker demand and seasonally high-planned maintenance outages. Free cash flow for the first quarter included a use of cash totaling $193 million for the final settlement with the IRS related to our timber monetization actions; we highlighted it during our last earnings call. This settlement allowed us to further de-risk our balance sheet. Also, about 31% of our annual capital expenditures occurred in the first quarter. Moving to the first quarter's sequential earnings bridge on slide six, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.53 as compared to $0.87 in the fourth quarter. Price and mix was lower by $0.10 per share due to the index movements across our portfolio. Lower export sales prices and unfavorable product mix at our Global Cellulose Fibers business as a result of lower absorbent pulp shipment.  Buying was flat sequentially as weaker demand and customer inventory destocking across both businesses was offset by four additional shipping days in our North American and Industrial Packaging business. In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, the first quarter was also lower due to the Chinese New Year. In operations and costs, our mills ran very well. However, quarter-over-quarter was unfavorable, because the fourth quarter benefited from favorable one-time items totaling $71 million or $0.15 per share related to lower employee benefit cost, workers comp expenses, and medical claims. In addition, our Cellulose Fibers business was impacted by higher economic downtime due to the lower demand environment I mentioned earlier. Maintenance outages were higher in the first quarter as planned and we saw significant relief from input costs, which were $134 million or $0.28 per share lower in the first quarter, primarily driven by lower energy and OCC costs. Corporate and other items was impacted by FX and timing of spend, partially offset by lower tax expense. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on slide seven, pricing mix was lower due to index movements and lower export prices. This was partially offset by benefits from commercial mix initiatives focused on margin improvement. Sequentially, volume benefited from four additional shipping days. However, demand for packaging weakened in March across most channels and segments for lower consumer demand and ongoing destocking across the supply chain. Even in this dynamic demand environment, International Paper is well-positioned due to our diverse portfolio of products and services and our strategic relationships with a large number of national and local customers across a broad range of attractive end segments.  Sequentially, Ops and costs were impacted by the non-repeat of approximately $57 million of favorable one-time items I mentioned earlier, as well as timing of spend. Overall, our mill system ran very well. The lower demand environment impacted operations and costs in the quarter, as we adjusted our system to align our production with customer demand. These actions resulted in approximately 421,000 tons of economic downtime across the system. Input costs were significantly lower and improved earnings by $105 million sequentially. Almost two-thirds of the benefit was from lower energy costs in North America and Europe, and the remainder was primarily from lower OCC and freight cost.  Overall we continue to face very elevated supply chain costs, as well as the impact from high inflation on materials and services during the past couple of years, and a lower demand environment we are running at full capacity. We believe there is a large opportunity to further optimize our system and take out high marginal costs. This remains a key lever in 2023. Turning to slide eight, we thought it'd be helpful to share some additional perspective on underlying segment trends for our corrugated packaging business. As shown on the previous slide, our U.S. box shipments were down 8.5% year-over-year in the first quarter, and down almost 12% year-over-year in the month of March. We saw a demand decline across all end-use segments on a year-over-year basis, and experienced another demand shift in March that impacted all segments except for e-commerce. Furthermore, demand declines were more pronounced in segments that generally are more discretionary in nature, as consumers had to make choices while dealing with high inflation and rising interest rates. The yellow indicators represent segments where the demand decline was less than our overall average of 8.5%, and the red indicators represent declines that were greater than the average decline. For example, processed food and protein were more resilient, down low to mid-single digits as consumers focus on essentials and value, and poultry serves as a low-cost consumer staple. Fresh produce was impacted by poor weather conditions on the West Coast and also in Florida.  On the other side of the spectrum, segments like durables and other non-durable consumer goods are more discretionary in nature. Along with shipping and distribution, these segments came under the most pressure with declines in the mid-teens. These segments also tend to be more affected by the inventory destocking efforts across the longer supply chains. E-commerce was down mid-single digits versus last year, but showed more resilience through the quarter and is still up 50% from pre-pandemic levels. Based on feedback from our customers, we believe the majority of retailer inventory destocking has been completed through the first quarter. However, manufacturers are still reducing inventories as a result of lower demand levels, improved supply chain velocity, and focus on working capital given higher interest rates.  We also believe the majority of destocking will be completed in the first half of the year, and considering our performance in April and looking at order backlogs, we expect sequentially higher volume in the second quarter. Despite these near-term headwinds, we understand the critical role corrugated packaging plays in bringing essential products to consumers and believe that IP is well-positioned to grow with our customers over the long term. Moving to Cellulose Fibers, on slide nine. Taking a look at our first quarter performance, price and mix was relatively flat sequentially. Our strategic initiative related to contract restructuring generated significant earnings improvement in the first quarter. However, this was offset by a less favorable mix due to lower fluff volumes in the quarter and a higher percentage of commodity grades, as well as the unfavorable impact from index movements. Volume was lower due to customer inventory destocking in response to improvements in the supply chain velocity from less port congestion and improved vessel reliability, and also impacted by the Chinese New Year. Feedback from our customers suggests the majority of destocking will be completed in the second quarter. With that said, we believe fluff demand will continue to grow over the long term. This is due to the essential role that absorbent personal care products play in meeting consumer needs. The lower demand environment significantly impacted operations and costs in the first quarter as we adjusted our system to align our production with our customer demand. These actions resulted in approximately 130,000 tons of economic downtime across the system, and accounted for approximately two-thirds of the ops and cost variance. Sequentially, ops and costs were also impacted by inflationary pressures, as well as the non-repeat of approximately $14 million of favorable one-time items in the fourth quarter that I mentioned earlier. Planned maintenance outages were higher by $11 million sequentially and represents one of the highest outage quarters of the year. In addition, input costs were lowered by $29 million due to lower energy and fiber costs. Turning to slide 10, our Global Cellulose Fibers business continues to make progress executing our strategy to deliver value creating returns over the business cycle. The business increased earnings by approximately $100 million in 2022 and is focused on driving incremental earnings growth this year despite operating in a more challenging macro environment. Our team successfully deployed a commercial strategy focused on building strategic relationships with key global and regional customers and aligning the most attractive regions and segments. In the fourth quarter, we finalized our fluff pulp contract negotiations, which is contributing meaningful commercial benefits this year.  Going forward, we believe there are significant opportunities to improve our cost to serve by reducing supply chain costs, which have increased significantly during the past couple of years. We expect to see these benefits will start to show up in our second quarter outlook. We are focused on creating value for our customers by delivering products that meet their stringent performance and product safety standards and deliver innovative value. In addition, we are driving structural margin improvement by ensuring we get paid for the value we provide. We believe this is reflected in the premium we earn for fluff pulp over commodity grades, which has expanded over time. We are committed to building on this momentum and expect to drive additional earnings growth going forward. Turning to slide 11, I'd like to update you on the building of better IP initiatives. We're making solid progress and delivered $65 million of year-over-year incremental earnings improvement in the first quarter. Our lean effectiveness initiative was mostly completed early in the program generating $110 million of cost savings since we began our building of better IP program. By streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with a more simplified portfolio, we more than offset 100% of the dis-synergies from the Printing Paper spinoff. The most significant driver of the year-over-year results was strategy acceleration, as we deliver profitable growth through commercial and investment excellence. As I mentioned earlier, we generated solid earnings growth in our Global Cellulose Fibers business on a path to deliver value creating returns. We're also focused on profitably growing our industrial packaging business by improving margins and investing for the long term. Process optimization initiative has the potential to reduce costs across areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics, and sourcing, as we leverage advanced technology and data analytics. We believe these initiatives will deliver meaningful benefits going forward as we finish implementing new capabilities across our business. Turning to slide 12, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions. As Mark highlighted earlier, we have a very strong balance sheet which we will preserve, because we believe it is core to our capital allocation framework. Our 2022 year-end leverage was 2.1x on a Moody's basis which is below our target range of 2.5x to 2.8x. Looking ahead we have limited medium-term debt maturities, and finally even in this environment the risk mitigation strategies we've taken help ensure our pension plan remains fully funded. Turning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the first quarter we returned $319 million to shareholders, including $157 million through share repurchases, which represents 4.3 million shares or about 1.2% of shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter our total authorization was approximately $3 billion. Going forward, we're committed to returning cash through maintaining our dividend and through opportunistic share repurchases.  Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We invested $341 million in our businesses in the first quarter, which includes funding for cost-reduction projects with attractive returns and for strategic projects to build out capabilities in our box system. Going forward, we plan to make additional investments across our box system to support long-term profitable growth and we will remain disciplined and selective when assessing M&A opportunities. Turning to slide 13, and our second quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price in mix to decrease earnings by $110 million, mainly as a result of prior index movement in North America and lower average export prices based on declines in the first quarter. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $30 million due to normal seasonal increase and daily shipments in North America, offsetting one-less shipping day. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $35 million due to the timing of spending.  Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $10 million, second quarter should represent approximately 30% of the total planned outage cost in 2023, and through the first half of the year we will have completed about 70% of expected annual outages. The second quarter includes approximately $19 million of spend associated with the Riverdale Mill printing papers outage. This cost will be fully recovered as part of the charges to Sylvamo over the course of the year. And lastly, input costs are expected to decrease by $30 million from lower average cost for energy and freight.  Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $45 million as a result of prior index movement. The volume is expected to increase earnings by $5 million, primarily based on seasonally higher demand. Operations and costs are expected to increase earnings by $40 million due to lower supply chain costs and lower unabsorbed fixed costs from higher volume. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $33 million and lastly, input costs are expected to decrease by $15 million, mostly due to lower energy and fiber cost.  Moving to our full year outlook on slide 14, as Mark discussed earlier, as we entered the year, we recognized there were macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of us, and that our businesses are not immune to these risks. The macro trends have shifted resulting in weaker than expected demand for our products and price reductions across our portfolio through the first quarter, including prior index changes that will be implemented over the remainder of the year. As a reminder, our previous outlook represented price indexes at that time. We are now projecting fully year 2023 EBITDA for the company to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.5 million. We continue to optimize our system by reducing high marginal cost, driving additional benefits from our building of better IP initiatives. This includes delivering continued earnings growth in our Global Cellulose Fibers business despite cycle headwinds. I would also note that our outlook includes only the impact from published price changes today. Free cash flow is expected to be $800 million to $900 million, which includes a one-time tax payment of $193 million in the first quarter related to our timber monetization settlement. In addition to free cash flow, we also expect to receive approximately $500 million of cash proceeds from the Ilim sale.  For 2023, we are targeting CapEx of $1 billion to $1.2 billion with increased investments in our U.S. box system to build additional capabilities and position us for long-term profitable growth with our customers. We will also focus on high-return cost reduction projects across our systems. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks Tim. Now I'm going to turn to slide 15. I want to reinforce my confidence in the resiliency of IP and our ability to navigate through this dynamic environment from a position of strength. As I mentioned earlier, our teams at International Paper know what it takes to successfully manage through a business cycle, by leveraging a wide range of options and capabilities across our large system of mills, box plants and supply chain, to optimize our cost while continuing to take care of our customers. Also, we are well positioned due to do our diverse portfolio of products and services, and our strategic relationships with a large number of national and local customers across a broad range of attractive end-use segments. And finally, we have significantly enhanced our financial strength and flexibility. The strong foundation that we have built makes IP well-positioned for success across a wide spectrum of economic environments and to deliver profitable growth over the long term. With that, we're going to move to Q&A and I'd like to note that I've invited our senior business leaders to join me for this portion of the call. Given the dynamic environment we're in, I thought it would be helpful for you to hear some additional perspective from these leaders. So operator, we are ready to go to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Hi! Good morning. Mark Sutton : Hi Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Hey! Mark, Tim, you talked about confidence in Global Cellulose Fibers earnings growth this year. Assuming the list prices that have been published I guess as of today, what gives you confidence that we won't either see further meaningful deterioration in fluff prices or the confidence that you have the offsets, like the commercial initiative to kind of offset any further deterioration? I'm just wondering if you can give us kind of any sense there. And then, if you can kind of remind us the lag from price change in the pulp index to your contracts and earnings. Mark Sutton : Okay, great question, Anthony. I'm going to take the first part of that, and then I'm going to ask Clay Ellis, who leads our Global Cellulose Fibers business to give you a little perspective on some of the changes we've made. I mean, the source of our confidence is we've really changed the way we go to market. And as we've explained many times, there's this contract portion which is generating significant earnings uplift in the contract large global multinational customer base. There is a portion of our business that's open market, that's traded more monthly or shorter term, less contractual, that's also absorbance. We have a specialty business that's not tracking exactly those markets.  And then the last piece, which is the most volatile, we still have exposure to market pulp, which is where a lot of the pricing issues have hit the business and will likely hit the business. So if we focus on the core, that's where our confidence is, around the absorbent, strategic customers and the profit improvement, and the changes we made really in the last 18 months that are coming to fruition. As far as the flow through and a little bit more about how we see the year happening, there's a story similar to what I described in my prepared remarks and what Tim described with destocking and where we think demand, the real demand from the end-use customer is going to go. And Clay, I'd ask you to maybe add some color to that. Clay Ellis : Sure, Mark. Hey Anthony, good question. Just to hit the lag time that you mentioned, in around a quarter, if you think about our index pricing, just think around a quarter lag in general. And around what gives us confidence, I think Mark was hitting on it there. Our end-use demand of absorbent, hygiene products we see, our customers see, is still solid. I was in Geneva last week at an index conference where we had many of our customers talk to many of our large global and also all the way to some small regional.  And across the Board, it's the same outlook on what consumers are doing in this space. Absorbent is good and the outlook is and would think about historical levels of growth. This inventory destocking is the story. It\u2019s what's happened. It's certainly more than we expected, a little longer and deeper. We do expect it to come mostly to an end in the second quarter, and so second half gives us confidence, returning to more normal volumes, improved mix, and then also the economic downtime that we're experiencing in the first half should largely be gone by then and we expect to be able to drive profitable growth even over last year. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. And then, switching to Industrial Packaging, you talked about confidence that destocking could run its course in the second quarter or by the end of the second quarter. I guess that's a comment on the domestic market. I'm wondering, when you think about the export channel, which I think you indicated remains weak, is it possible to think about sort of where customer inventories are there? Is there any sort of light at the end of the tunnel or regions that are maybe improving or maybe getting worse? I don't know if there's any general comments there. Mark Sutton : Yeah, that's a great question, Anthony. You're right. Both Tim and I's prepared comments were primarily focused on the largest market we're in, which is North America. But Jay Royalty is here. Jay runs our global container board business as well as our EMEA packaging business, and I think Jay has been working very feverishly with the teams to try to understand just that. So Jay, if you want to comment a bit on Anthony's question about export markets and the non-U.S. phenomena of destocking and demand. Jay Royalty : Sure, Mark. Hi Anthony. So yeah, I think when you look at the export channel; it's been and remains particularly weak. We've seen very low demand for the last several months due to a lot of different factors, whether it's geopolitical, high inventory levels, low consumer activity as it relates to inflation. And then also, weather for fruit and vegetable goods has been not cooperating really around the globe, the U.S., Europe, even into places like Morocco. We are seeing inventory levels improving and we can start to see some stabilization there in terms of any signs of improvement. I think those are few and far between, maybe a little bit in Latin America, which is one of the markets we serve. But these markets will rebound at some point. Our positions across Europe, Latin America, Asia, these are with customers who really value kraft linerboard heavily oriented to fruit and vegetable segments and those are going to grow with consumer activity and consumption over time. So we feel good about the future, but certainly in this moment it's particularly weak, and that's putting pressure on both demand as well as pricing. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : And our next question is from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew McKellar : Yeah, thanks very much. I was wondering if you could add a little bit of just color in terms of what you're seeing in demand in the industrial packaging business to start Q2, maybe compared to both March and Q1 as a whole, and particularly thinking about the different customer segments and where you're seeing areas of relative strength and weakness. Mark Sutton : That's a great question, Matthew. This is Mark. I mean, we look at demand in two components. There's the final end-use consumer. I think we term that, our marketers term that organic demand. And then there's the demand ahead of that in the manufacturers and the supply chain ahead of the consumer. Those manufacturers are really our customers.  And then when you break it down by segment, Tim had that colorful chart where he looked at the broad segments. But Tom Hamic, who leads our North American box business is here, and I'd ask him to give some insight on your question about how we see it going forward, what gives us confidence on our comments about the de-stocking piece, and then maybe some segment comments. Tom. Tom Hamic : Sure. Thanks Mark and good morning Matthew. We exited or entered the second quarter very strong relative to March. So we've got good momentum moving from March to April. You could think about shipments being up maybe 5% to 6% and our backlogs are actually better than that. So we see that almost double-digit improvement in backlog.  So I think that indicates how we've thought about de-stocking is it's not going to go away immediately, but it is going to transition through the second quarter. Because as Mark mentioned and Tim mentioned, different segments have different levels of de-stocking that they are having to work through, and so it's not a uniform everyone has too much in the in-inventory. It depends on the segment and if it's perishable goods or something like that. I think our confidence in understanding de-stocking is we triangulate between macro data, a lot of customer conversations about what they are seeing in the near term, as well as our experience in these segments over time and how they are growing and how we understand their supply chain to work.  And on a positive sense, all of those point us in the same direction as this plays out through the second quarter. Obviously, there's a component of that that's demand dependent. But in large part we feel good about the momentum for where the box business is headed. Matthew McKellar : Great! Thanks, that's helpful. And then shifting over, can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about share purchases here? Should we continue to expect them to sort of trend in line with Q4 and Q1 levels or do you maybe see more limited room for repurchases given the downward revision to free cash flow look or do you even accelerate repurchases given where the shares are trading? Thanks. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. Hey Matthew, it's Tim. So I would just step back from the specific on share repurchases and say I think you're familiar with our capital allocation framework, and we take that into consideration across all the uses of cash in everything that we do.  As Mark said, starting with a strong balance sheet, it gives us tremendous financial flexibility. Maintaining the dividend is a complete commitment and we target opportunistic share repurchases. So we're constantly looking at the environment, and in any moment in time we're making decisions around where is the best place to deploy cash for value creation and maximization. So nothing's going to change in terms of how we think about that framework through the cycle. All parts of the cycle, it comes into consideration. Matthew McKellar : Okay, thanks. I'll turn it back. Operator : And our next question is from Gabrial Hajde with Wealth Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Gabrial Hajde : Mark, Tim, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mark Sutton : Good morning, Gabe. Gabrial Hajde : I wanted to revisit I think Tim's prepared remarks on slide seven. I want to make sure I heard what you wanted us to hear, which was I think you talked about facing higher supply chain costs, and in sort of the current low environment there was \u2013 I think Tim, your words were \u2018further opportunity to optimize the system.\u2019 I'm assuming that means take out, continue to take out variable costs of the system or has there been sort of a change in philosophy in thinking about your mill system or maybe the box system overall, where you can make some permanent adjustments? A - Tim Nicholls : No, you had it right. I mean, we're talking about how we run the system we have as efficiently as possible. And when you're taking this amount of downtime, you're constantly trying to optimize on the marginal cost and get out the high marginal cost, and so it's something that we started \u2013 well, we started it years ago, but more recently we started looking at marginal cost in the second half of last year, and it continued in the first half of this year. And just given the dramatic nature and shift in demand and the way we've responded, it's taken a little bit more time than normal, but we're starting to see how it plays through in not only in inputs and buying the highest cost inputs, but now into transportation as well. So it's a real focus on just getting out as much cost as possible. Mark Sutton : Yeah. Gabe, you know sometimes \u2013 this is Mark. Sometimes we get, and we may get it later in the call, we get a question about, would we consider changing the way we operate in lower demand environments versus the current approach to running most of our system at different levels of output instead of running part and not running part. And we evaluate that, I mean really almost on a continuous basis.  And depending on what's happening, as Tim described, the supply chain environment we're in and then the cost gradient we have at most of the mills on fiber and OCC and other inputs, there is huge savings for eliminating the high marginal cost across 17 different mills. And you can imagine if you decided to temporarily close one or two of them, then you have to add back all that marginal cost at the others, because in theory they're going to run full, and then depending on geography and logistics you end up with no net savings. So we are continuing to look at that.  We have gotten \u2013 I didn't think we could get a lot better, but our teams have gotten better at marginal cost takeout across systems running much lower than full capacity. But we don't take anything off the table in terms of figuring out the best way to operate for the quarter ahead or the two quarters ahead with the best information we have about the demand signal. But it's really an optimization of the total cost and the value in that marginal cost reduction is really powerful. Gabrial Hajde : Thank you for that. And then I guess a little bit more short term in nature here. You talked about input costs being $30 million favorable in industrial packaging. I suspect an element of that is maybe lower natural gas. And do you have an explicit assumption for kind of OCC hovering where we are today, and I sort of ask the question, because one of your peers talked about a pretty healthy rail price increases that came into effect April 1. Curious if that's something that impacts you. And then sort of for the implied second half guidance, is there anything explicit in there that you would instruct us towards in terms of underlying assumptions for some of your bigger inputs, whether it's again virgin fiber, recycled fiber or energy? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, so hi, its Tim again. I think the headline is we're not \u2013 the second quarter is going to be better. It depends on which category of the cost that you're talking about. On natural gas, we pretty much follow the strip. There are some distribution charges and things like that that impact it, but the movement is very similar and so you can see how that plays out.  On OCC, we have a modest \u2013 we believe there could be a modest increase over time, but the whole environment is so fluid and dynamic, it's going to depend on how it plays out over this quarter and as we go into the third quarter. Chemicals for us are getting a little bit better and transportation, I don't know the reference you mentioned on the contract. These times are at different points in time and it's a mixture across all the modes of transportation that we're seeing.  But I'd say on balance, we get another benefit on input costs in the second quarter and depending on the scenario, it's kind of flattish as you go out with the second half of the year. There is this small pick-up, but again, it's going to depend on the backdrop. Gabrial Hajde : All right, thank you for that and good luck! Operator : And our next question is from a Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go to the outlook and was wondering if you can kind of walk us through some of the moving parts regarding the new updated outlook versus the initial target. Anyway to kind of size how much of that reduction is driven by the corrugated packaging business versus cellulose fibers. How much is driven by the change in pricing versus maybe the weaker demand environment that we're in? Tim Nicholls : Yeah, so you're talking about the 2.8 versus the new range of 2.3 to 2.5 Kyle? Kyle White : Yeah, that's correct. Tim Nicholls : Yeah. So March was, I think there\u2019s no other way to say it. That was a surprise to us in terms of demand drop-off and the resulting economic downtime that we took to balance out our system. But when you look at it, we had further price, published price decreases. For pulp export prices came down. We had lower volume and we had more EBT, which means more cost.  And then you look at how that evolves as we go through the second quarter in the second half of the year, those things are going to be present, but we also get as I mentioned, a little bit better on input costs. We have a significant drop-off in maintenance outages, because we're really front-end loaded, front half loaded on our maintenance outages. And then there's some additional costs that come out. So when we looked at all of it, there was some pretty significant moves in the month of March, that even though it's getting better, you know it still impacts the first part of the second quarter. Kyle White : Got it. And then I guess if we go back to last quarter, I think you guys talked about box shipments potentially being able to come back to being flat for 2023, and that was assumed in maybe the outlook that you had initially. Obviously destocking has been a little bit more than everyone has anticipated and provided for a weaker demand environment. Are you able to kind of help us understand what is embedded in terms of the new outlook on where you think box shipments could be for the full year now? Tom Hamic : Sure, this is Tom Hamic again. You know our view on boxes, and we say this a lot, is that economic activity drops box demand. And so as we see the economy, we not only expect box demand to tie directly to it. There really is no near-term substitute for a box when you're thinking about delivering to a retail channel or really any channel in the U.S. So we're confident about that rebound. I would say in terms of the full year, most of the difference we have, what we thought for the full year and what we think now is happening in the first half due to this destocking. So it's really hard to forecast the full year exactly. I think it's going to depend on us being correct about the second quarter and the de-stocking playing out, because the economy is also going to be an open question. But in general, we see this improving. Kyle White : Got it. That makes sense. I'll turn it over. Operator : And next we go to Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Obviously one of the concerns investors have had is about the new supply that's coming into the marketing container board. I particularly thought would try and take advantage of the fact that you've got some industry leaders on the call. Just getting the update on your thoughts as to how that could \u2013 where that capacity perhaps is right now? Is it already being absorbed and/or things to think about how that might play out as you see it? Jay Royalty : Yeah Mark, this is Jay Royalty. Good to talk to you. I think that a few things to keep in mind relative to this new capacity that's coming in. First of all, the open market is relatively small as you know. Our position in that market is really made up of long-term strategic relationships and including in some cases some equity positions.  So we've got very little spot business and it's important to remember that at the end of the day people buy boxes and you all \u2013 they don't buy container board. Producers may buy some container board, but at the end of the day it's about having an integrated system which is what we have and customer needs are complex. And so you think about what customers value and what they are looking for and what IP brings to customers, you know it's about comprehensive offerings, there's a wide rate mix there, geographic reach, redundant capabilities, having the ability to search and flex with their needs, all of these things are important.  So you know it's really about more than a single mill. It's about having a system in those capabilities and that's what customers value and so when you think about our relationships, our customers are looking for those things, that's what allows us to have these long-term strong relationships and so the new entrants are going to be trying to compete with that in some form of fashion. Mark Weintraub : Okay. That's helpful, thanks Jay. And just maybe if I could follow-up on the distinction between the shipments which I think you mentioned we're up 5%, 6% so far in April, so encouraging, and then backlogs being-up double digit. What should we make of that? What does \u2013 the backlog, is that a lead indicator for where shipments likely would go to and recognizing we've had some very, very difficult demand environment, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but could this mean that we're actually closer to being through on the destock and \u2013 but why that\u2019s sort of the conservativeness, again what we've gone through. Good reason enough right there. But just trying to get a little bit more color and thoughts on the shipments and the backlog data you were talking about for April to date. Tom Hamic : Sure Mark. This is Tom again. Just for some clarity that you had it right, the shipment common I had was about 6% and that's sequential from March and obviously as Tim talked about earlier, March was weaker than the second quarter, but it's still as strong sign of momentum. Backlogs tend to be more volatile, because as the market gets better you get more and more orders because customers see that lean times in all of that. So it's a good indicator more of the future than it is in the moment, but I think you combine the shipment outlook we have with the backlogs improving, it points you to where probably for any close on the second quarter play out that Mark and Tim talked about, because if we're not seeing it in this month you probably have a bit of a delay. So it feels like to me it all fits together and that's what we're hearing from customers. Mark Weintraub : One real quick follow-up then. Have you seen in the last say six months when we've been in this really difficult demand environment, have you seen where the shipments and backlogs went up and then they just roll back over again or is this the first time you\u2019ve really seen this? Tom Hamic : I think this is the first time we've seen a significant shift from what you would think about seasonally. You certainly can have a segment that changes and it might affect if it's big enough, it might affect your total mix. But I would say we have \u2013 thinking about it, don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me. I don't think we've had a falser start. Mark Weintraub : Okay, super. I appreciate it. Operator : Next we go to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Jay and Tom, good to hear your voices, hope you\u2019re doing well. I had some technical difficulties getting on the call and you may have mentioned this. But the last call in our Q&A you had suggested that fluff GCF could see roughly a couple hundred million dollar improvement in profitability. Is there an update to that?  And then kind of the granularity, if I look at the waterfall and your outlook, and I look at what maintenance is going to look like sequentially the next couple quarters in GCF, I don't get much of an improvement in earnings this year. And so just thinking about what is the \u2013 embedded in your guidance for GCF, where should we see earnings move? And as we sit here today realizing destocking has been a big factor and hopefully the revision of that will allow earnings to improve. Talk about why you still see this as a real good business to have for IP to be in for its shareholders Mark structurally, and I had a question on container board. Mark Sutton : Okay George, thanks. Great question. Let me just hit the headline and then I\u2019ll ask Clay to comment on what's embedded in our outlook. And really ask him to remind and separate the absorbent and specialty core part of the business and then the rest of the business, which tends to be more volatile and commodity. The $200 million had certain assumptions aligned with it. Some of those assumptions have changed. We still see line of sites somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million plus improvement in the business and so there's still going to be earnings improvement in business and we just have to adjust what the timing of those improvements are given the change in some of the pricing assumptions and the we were operating.  So Clay, you might want to talk a little bit about the puts and takes that make up that full year outlook. Clay Ellis : Yes, thanks Mark. Hey George. So you mentioned you may have missed some of the early flow, but just to re-kind of try to minute on what we see causing the issue in the first half is almost all destocking. We do have a lot of confidence in the end use consumer demand of absorbent hygiene products and we see that future being lot like historical and growth.  And so, while we're confident about it or excited about it, this is a very, in the moment kind of current issue, really an unprecedented issue with the inventory flow through. We believe we'll come out of that have a stronger second half and you made mention of the $200 million from the last called, those changes have been made and they're flowing through in the pricing, so that's there. But, with the low volume that we've had, the low customer order rate taking the EDT that we're taking, and the price moves, it has eroded about $150 million of the $200 million as we see, as those prices flow through the year. So to Mark\u2019s point, the $50 million still accretive to last year earnings is what we see on top of $100 hundred million in \u201822 versus \u201821.  So we're confident as we get that the consumer demand is there, we get through this issue, we'll get our volumes more normalized, our mixed more normalized, get away from the EDT cost that Tim had mentioned, and we feel confident, we feel strong about it moving forward. Mark Sutton : George, I\u2019ll just wrap the question you asked, the last part about why we still believe it's a good business and a good thing for IP shareholders. I mean when you look at the business that we're in now, corrugated packaging, Cellulose Fibers for absorbent products, we've got two natural resource based businesses, both facing growing end-used markets. Both directly in our wheelhouse from a manufacturing and process standpoint, and when you then layer out \u2013 forget about the product and look at the customer and the supply chain. You layer out the types of customers and what they value. Solutions, technical design, the same kinds of things they value in the box business they value in the Cellulose Fibers business.  It's a more global customer base in Cellulose Fibers than it is in our box business, but we believe that starting with that softwood fiber renewable, a very, very good well positioned manufacturing base, turning that into products that are facing growing markets, is giving IP a higher quality of value creation, single product line type of company and we believe that that's valuable in the long term.  And we don't think about just single moments like one year or a couple of quarters. We look at this down the road over the next decade, where things head, where the types of products that both businesses are making are headed and we think that's exciting for investors as they sort out where sustainable natural resource type companies did in their portfolios. George Staphos : Thanks Mark. On packaging, recognizing ultimately customer spec boxes, the box spec then dictates the substrate in the sheet of paper you're going to run on the corrugator to make the box and everything else that follows. Given that we've seen the cost curve shift a bit towards recycled versus virgin in terms of whose low on the cost curve right now, and also given the shifts that or occurring in the end markets, we\u2019re realizing this is really kind of a one quarter issue, not a structural issue, nonetheless we're seeing weakness and durable good weakness and AG. Is there anything we should take away about what your mix might look like in industrial over the next two, three quarters or more structurally or do you think relative to the mill fleet, relative what you're doing on converting, do you think your mix of business will be as rich if not richer over time than what we've seen in the last couple of years. Thanks and good luck in the year. Tom Hamic : Yeah, sure George. This is Tom. George Staphos : Hey Tom. Tom Hamic : You talked about \u2013 Hey, how are you? You talked a little bit about the different substrates and I think as a customer of the container board system, that's a huge advantage for us, because we've got this huge base of manufacturing different products, different grades. And so since we have direct access to those, we can design the box and the box plant mix directly around that. In terms of the destocking and how we feel about these different segments, I think we're going to see different levels of destocking by segment like we talked about. But I think we should expect a normalization of demand, because the U.S. economy is going to recover. That may take a little longer given the economic conditions, but certainly it's coming. And then maybe a little bit of a specific piece to your question is, one of the biggest improvements we've seen coming into April is [inaudible]. So that has been a really tough business because of weather over the last couple of years and we're starting to see that pop back up, which I think is a very good sign. Mark Sutton : George, I'll just end Tom's comments with the long-term question you asked about, do we see our mix as a richer mix for the whole value chain, the packaging paper, the container board we make and the types, and then the ultimate box and packaging solution we provide. And our strategy is pointed toward a richer mix over time and our mill system will evolve in the type of products we make. Where we make them, we've got a heavy concentration in the Southeastern part of the U.S., but we've got a market that covers the entire of North America really. And so you'll probably see in the future slightly different locations over time, and probably definitely higher quality recycling being feathered into our mix. And I\u2019ll point to our most recent container board investment is a game changing level of quality white top liner that brings us into a whole new set of segments, where we were purchasing some of that paper before, it was good paper, and we were making some ourselves, which was second tier, and now we have some of the best clinical white liner. And so you'll only see investments that incrementally improve us on quality and product capability, which again to Jay\u2019s point only matters if you turn it into a box that people want and are willing to pay for. So that's the focus we see the business getting better over time, with a richer mix and a good end-to-end from natural resource to finish product value chain that we can be the best at every part of that for our customers. George Staphos : Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question for today comes from a line of Phil Ng with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Phil Ng : Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. Despite a pretty challenging backdrop Tim, the free cash flow is still showing to be pretty resilient here and you should be getting I believe $500 million cash proceeds from Ilim. What's the game plan in deploying that excess cash hopefully coming very soon? Tim Nicholls : Hey Phil, it\u2019s Tim. It's like we always do. We have our capital allocation framework and we look at where we are in the moment and then make decisions on how to best deploy cash for values. So it'll be the same type of construct as free cash flow comes in and incremental cash for mill. Phil Ng : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And from a pulp side of things, market pulp prices certainly seeing some pressure. Curious in your confidence and maintain that large premium versus fluff. And supply chain logistics certainly was very choked up last year. So being mindful of how hard it was to kind of see through the destocking container board, your level of confidence that the destock will be done in 2Q? And I'm just curious, how you started seeing any lift in China starting to reopen here? Mark Sutton : So Phil, let me quarterback here. Clay is going to take a question on the premium and the work we've done to change our go-to-market in fluff and our confidence in maintaining that and then I'll ask Jay to comment on the container board. Actually the question of supply chain that really covers both businesses may be even more Cellulose Fibers in terms of getting things through the port and the velocity has improved. That doesn't get better visibility. But you asked specifically about container board in China. Jay will take that one. So Clay, if you would answer the question about [Cross Talk]. Phil Ng : Mark, my question on the supply chain was really more on fluff. I just made the point on container board, because it was pretty hard to see through that. Just your confidence just kind of see through just what\u2019s out there. Mark Sutton : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, Phil. Sorry Phil, I misunderstood your question. So Clay will take both of them. Clay Ellis : So, hey Phil. This is Clay Ellis. It's good to talk to you. Your first point on market pulp, yeah pricing on market pulp, paper grade pulps, they were down in the first quarter, somewhat resilient in Q1 and then in April we've seen a huge decline and you can see that in the publications through the month of April. And so over time you can see the fluff pricing being resilient, keeping a pretty good high premium over market pulp, we expect that to continue. I think when you look at the whole ecosystem of the fibers and the pulp, clearly going down through the first quarter, and then paper grade as we said on through April. Fluff isn't immune to that. Of course fluff prices have moved down some as well, but I think that fluff prices will continue to be less volatile. They'll continue to maintain a premium, but to be realistic in the whole ecosphere of the fibers, when they go down, there's a gravity on fluff too.  So, it's why it's more important for us to be higher integrated into fluff, to have the capacity to grow with our customers, future growth in that space and remove or mitigate some of our susceptibility to the more paper grader to the market commodity pulps. Phil Ng : And then your confidence is working through the supply chain and seeing through the destock? Clay Ellis : Yes, very good confidence. Again, I mentioned on the call earlier last week with a lot of customers the Geneva Conference. Even our customers did not see the level of stocks, and when I talk about stocks, it's not just fluff. It's further through the entire absorbent hygiene supply chain. So all the way from retailers, converters, hour customers, and then all the way back into the raw materials like fluff.  It was higher, more than anyone saw. But \u2013 so we see our customers are there seeing the retailers order more, getting more normal. So they are seeing that slack has come out of the road. We're seeing our inventories of fluff getting really down to historically lower than historical. So we see also part of this I think has been lowering the inventories across the supply chain, the targets from where they were in the past. So I think that's caused even prolonging this a bit more. But everybody sees more of the slack out of the system now and they see it coming out and everyone's seeing their orders, no matter where they are in the supply chain, begin to pick up and moving into the second half. Phil Ng : And has that China reopening dynamic given you a little more confidence or it hasn\u2019t really had much of an impact quite yet. Clay Ellis : Yes, it gives us more confidence that one, it's not a consumer demand issue. That it is destocking and that we can see the end. So yes, that gives us confidence. Phil Ng : Okay, thanks a lot. Great color. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mark Sutton, Chairman and CEO for closing comments. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Leah, and I'd like to thank everyone for your time today and for your continued interest in International Paper. I look forward to updating our progress as the year unfolds. And again, I would just like to thank our employees for the hard work through these challenging times, which really you can argue started a couple of years ago. They continue to show up every day, taking care of our customers, running safe and efficient plants, and selling and delivering products to our customers and I couldn't be prouder and happier to be leading this great team of people of International Paper.  So, thanks again for your interest in our company and have a great day! Operator : And once again, we'd like to thank you for your participating in today's International Paper\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3 where I will highlight our results. In the second quarter, our operations ran very well and managed our businesses effectively in a challenging demand environment while taking care of our customers. Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered $55 million of year-over-year incremental earnings benefit from our Building a Better IP initiatives. This program contributed $120 million of benefits through the first half of the year, and we are on track to exceed our full year target for the second year in a row. Underlying demand for our products improved throughout the quarter, but remain constrained by inventory destocking as our customers and broader supply chain work through elevated inventories of their products. Based on discussions with our customers and trends observed across the various end-use segments for packaging and pulp products, we believe consumer priority in the second quarter remain focused on services as well as non-discretionary goods. This trend has been influenced by a pull forward of goods during the pandemic as well as inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. However, based on feedback from our customers, we also believe that destocking is finally coming to the close. Margins remained under pressure due to the resulting weak volumes and lower prices across our portfolio. However, this was partially offset by lower input and distribution expenses as our team worked to reduce our marginal cost. On capital allocation, we returned $200 million to shareholders in the quarter. And with respect to the sale of our Ilim investment, I reported last quarter that the Russian buyers received an important required approval from the Russian sub-commissioned overseeing exits by foreign companies. They are still awaiting the approval from the Russian Competition Authority. Buyers continue to pursue this approval, and we expect to close as soon as all regulatory approvals are secured. I will now turn it over to Tim, who will provide more details about our second quarter performance and our third quarter outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Turning to our second quarter key financials on Slide 4. Operating earnings per share increased sequentially and also came in better than the outlook we provided last quarter as we effectively optimized our system through commercial and operational initiatives. Operating margins continued to be impacted by low volumes, but improved sequentially as lower outage expense and favorable input costs more than offset the impact from lower sales prices. In the second quarter, we generated $261 million of free cash flow. Recall that free cash flow from the first quarter was impacted by $193 million final settlement payment to the IRS related to our timber monetization, which allowed us to further derisk our balance sheet. Moving to second quarter sequential earnings on Slide 5, second quarter operating earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.53 in the first quarter. Pricing mix was lower by $0.29 per share due to index movements across our portfolio. Lower export prices and unfavorable product mix in our Global Cellulose Fibers business as a result of lower absorbent pulp shipments. Volume was flat sequentially as improved demand in our North American Industrial Packaging business was offset by weaker demand in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Volume in both businesses were impacted by customer inventory destocking. Operations and costs was also flat as our mills continue to run very well. Higher ops and costs in our Industrial Packaging business, primarily due to economic downtime, was offset by lower ops and costs in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Maintenance outages were lower by $88 million or $0.19 per share in the second quarter and we saw a significant relief from input costs, which were $83 million, or $0.18 per share lower, primarily driven by lower energy, wood and distribution costs. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. Price and mix was lower due to index movements and lower export prices. This was partially offset by benefits from commercial initiatives focused on margin improvement. Sequentially, volume was higher despite one less shipping day as demand continued to improve throughout the quarter from the March trough. Our U.S. box shipments were down 8.3% year-over-year in the second quarter as demand for packaging continued to be impacted by ongoing inventory destocking by our customers. However, June was down 5.9% year-over-year as the quarter improved. Lower demand environment impacted operations and costs in the quarter as we aligned our production with our customer demand while also optimizing our inventories and taking fewer planned maintenance outages. These actions resulted in approximately 622,000 tons of economic downtime across the system, which accounted for approximately two thirds of the ops and cost variance. The remainder was primarily due to timing of spending for materials and services. Overall, our mill system ran very well. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $54 million sequentially, partially reflecting deferral or some outages in the second half of the year as we continue to optimize our outages. Significantly lower input costs improved earnings by $66 million in the quarter. We benefited from lower energy, wood and distribution costs, some of which was due to the relentless efforts by our business teams to call back high marginal cost while optimizing our systems in the current demand environment. To give you an example of this, our mill and fiber procurement teams have made tremendous progress reducing fiber costs by optimizing mix and shedding our highest cost supplier of fiber to the mills. Our teams across the mill and box plants also are driving significant reductions in distribution costs by doing things like reducing highest cost of freight carriers, renegotiating contract rates, increasing weights per load, reducing miles per load and shedding warehouse and to merge expense. Turning to Slide 7. I'll share some perspective regarding how inventory destocking is progressing for our customers. Based on their feedback and our own analysis, we believe inventory destocking across the supply chain has accounted for a large portion of overall demand declines this year. It is also lasting longer than initial expectations due to the limited visibility across the entire supply chain of excess inventories built up during the pandemic. Feedback from some of our large \u2013 larger customers suggest that approximately 75% of them entered the third quarter at or below inventory levels \u2013 target inventory levels. The good news is that given feedback from our customers and looking at the data, we expect this destocking trend to be completed in the third quarter. On Slide 8, some additional data supports our current view. We believe the majority of retailer inventory destocking was completed in the first quarter. However, manufacturers are still reducing inventories through the second quarter as a result of lower demand levels, improved supply chain velocity and focus on working capital given higher interest rates. Despite the current environment, corrugated packaging plays a critical role in bringing essential products to consumers. IP is well positioned to grow with our customers over the long-term due to our diverse portfolio of products and services and our strategic relationships with a large number of national and local customers across a broad range of attractive end-use segments. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 9. Taking a look at the second quarter performance, price and mix was lower due to price index movements and a higher level of commodity grades in the quarter in response to weaker fluff pulp shipments. As a reminder, approximately 85% of the products in this business are exported as International Paper serves major global and regional customers around the world. As we entered the year, fluff pulp volumes came under pressure. First, consumer demand for absorbent hygiene products was lower driven by inflationary pressures. And second, there was significant inventory destocking across the long supply chains. This destocking trend continued in the second quarter as supply chains became more efficient and reliable. As a result, customers were able to work down safety stocks that were built up in response to the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. This resulted in approximately 143,000 tons of economic downtime across the system as we aligned our production with customer demand. The combined impact of lower volumes and a higher mix of commodity grades continue to negatively impact business earnings. Looking forward, based on feedback from our customers and order bookings, majority of destocking should be completed in the third quarter, and we believe fluff demand will continue to grow over the long-term. This is due to the essential role absorbent personal products play in meeting customer needs. Coming back to the second quarter, operations and costs improved sequentially as we benefited from lower distribution costs and our business teams remain focused on driving down the high marginal costs going forward. Sequentially, ops and cost were also favorably impacted by seasonally lower energy consumption and higher residual energy sales. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $34 million sequentially, and input costs were lower by $17 million due to low energy and chemical costs. Turning to Slide 10. I'll take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions. We have a strong balance sheet, which is core to our capital allocation framework. Looking ahead, we have limited medium-term debt maturities and our pension plan remains fully funded. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second quarter, we returned $200 million to shareowners. Going forward, we are committed to returning cash by maintaining our dividend. Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We invested $267 million in our businesses in the second quarter, which includes funding for cost reduction projects with attractive returns and for strategic projects to build out capabilities and our box system. Going forward, we plan to make additional investments across our box system to support long-term profitable growth. And we will remain disciplined and selective when assessing M&A opportunities. On Slide 11, we\u2019ll take a look at the third quarter outlook. I will start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $95 million as a result of prior index movement in North America and lower average export prices based on declines to date. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $5 million due to improving demand and daily shipments in North America, offsetting one less shipping day. Operations and costs are expected to increase earnings by $95 million, more than half is due to lower cost of company paid benefits and our cost management initiatives. The balance is primarily due to lower unabsorbed fixed costs. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $28 million. And lastly, rising input costs are expected to decrease earnings by $15 million from higher average energy costs. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $40 million as a result of prior index movements and declines in spot pricing to date. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $10 million as demand improves from lower inventory destocking. Operations and costs are expected to be stable relative to the second quarter. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $12 million. And lastly, declining input costs are expected to increase earnings by $10 million, mostly due to lower fiber and chemical costs. On Slide 12, we\u2019ll take a look at the full year outlook. As we entered the year, we recognize the macroeconomic uncertainties ahead of us and that our businesses were not immune to these risks. These macro trends have shifted resulting in weaker-than-expected demand for our products and price reductions across our portfolio through the second quarter, including prior index changes that will be implemented over the remainder. I would also remind you that we \u2013 that when we provide an outlook, it includes only the impact from published price changes to date. We are now projecting full year 2023 EBITDA for the company to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Despite the market headwinds, we are taking actions across the company to optimize our system by reducing high marginal cost and driving additional commercial and cost benefits from our building a better IP initiatives. And Mark will share more about these opportunities in the next few slides. Free cash flow is expected to be between $500 million and $600 million, which includes the onetime tax payment of $193 million in the first quarter related to our timber monetization settlement. For 2023, we are targeting CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, with increased investments in our U.S. box system. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. I\u2019m going to turn to Slide 13 now, and I\u2019d like to provide our quarterly update on our building a better IP initiatives. You can see the targets and the appropriate metrics on the slide. But as I mentioned earlier on the call, we\u2019re making solid progress and delivered $55 million in year-over-year incremental earnings improvement in the second quarter for a total befit of $120 million year-to-date. Given this strong momentum, we expect to exceed our original target again this year. And these are issues and opportunities that are unique to IP that will shine through as we see the economic conditions improve. Our lean effectiveness initiative contributed $116 million of the cost savings since we began our building a better IP program in 2020. Early on, by streamlining our corporate and staff functions to realign with our more simplified portfolio after the spin-off of our papers business, we more than offset 100% of those dis-synergies resulting from spinoff. Majority of the benefits going forward will come and are coming from our strategy acceleration and process optimization initiatives, where our business teams have intense focus on creating significant value through commercial strategies and by leveraging advanced technologies and big data across our large system to improve productivity and lower costs. I\u2019m excited about these opportunities. And in the next couple of slides, I\u2019d like to share more examples of what our teams are working on in some of the early results. So turning to Slide 14. Let\u2019s start with our Industrial Packaging business. As you can see on the slide, our teams across the business are pursuing multiple opportunities to improve margins and drive profitable growth. First, I\u2019ll mention that we\u2019re making good progress on reducing high marginal costs. Tim has previously referenced that input and distribution costs increased by more than $2 billion for IP over the period of pandemic. Coming into the year, clawing back these high marginal costs was an area of intense focus for us. We are accomplishing this by doing things like optimizing mix and usage of fiber and energy, reducing labor costs and over time, shifting to lower-cost suppliers, driving lower distribution costs and reducing discretionary spending and overhead expenses. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we\u2019re also invest in our box business to expand our capabilities and improve productivity for future growth. On the commercial front, we have opportunities to leverage these new investments as well as our market expertise to further improve our mix and capture additional value. As we look across our system of mills and box plants, we are seeing real potential to leverage advanced technology and data analytics. In fact, some of that work is helping us get to levels of marginal cost reduction in high economic downtime periods that we\u2019ve never reached before. Over the past year, we\u2019ve developed and piloted new tools and capabilities to increase efficiency and reduce cost across a broad number of categories. We\u2019re starting to see benefits in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics as well as sourcing and we anticipate significant benefits as we continue to deploy these new technologies across our manufacturing system. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to drive profitable growth over the long term. Turning to Slide 15, I\u2019ll share some key opportunities in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Over the past year, we have captured meaningful benefits from our commercial initiatives, and believe that there are more opportunities to capture significant value in this business as we continue to execute our revised go-to-market strategy. For example, our commercial teams finalized our fluff pulp contract negotiations which is contributing meaningful commercial benefit this year. In addition, we have earned a higher premium for fluff grades relative to commodity grades by capturing more value and aligning with those customers and segments and regions of the world who value our differentiated product and service offerings. However, the benefits of our commercial strategy are currently being masked by a very challenging and unprecedented business cycle as well as our exposure to the commodity grades that are not our core focus. As Tim mentioned earlier, it began with major supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, followed by significant inventory destocking actions that continue to constrain demand today. This combination of elevated supply chain costs and lower volumes have had a substantial impact on business earnings. But we do not believe that these issues are structural. And as I said, we have more opportunities to capture significant value going forward and we will continue to test this strategy over the business cycle. Fundamentally, I believe there\u2019s a good business within this business and that we can continue to grow earnings and cash flows over the cycle. We are focused on creating value for our customers by delivering products that meet their stringent performance and product safety standards while delivering innovation. Over time, we have an opportunity to improve our mix by reducing our exposure to commodity grades. We can further align with customers in end-use markets that allow us to maximize the value of this business, while optimizing our overall cost structure. I will now turn to Slide 16. As you can see, there are several key areas of opportunity we\u2019re working on to navigate the current economic environment while driving profitable growth over the long term. Combined with our strong financial foundation, International Paper is well positioned for success, and none of this would be accomplished or possible without our team of talented and engaged employees. I will close by expressing my appreciation for all of our work of our International Paper employees and for our strong customer relationships. And with that, we\u2019re happy to move to the question-and-answer section. And similar to last quarter, our senior business leaders are joining me to provide you with their perspectives. So, operator, we\u2019ll lead you now to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Go ahead. Mike Roxland : Thank you. Thank you, Mark, Time and Mark for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter. Just can you walk us through some of the moving parts regarding the updated EBITDA outlook versus your prior target any way to kind of size how much of that reduction is driven by Industrial Packaging versus Global Cellulose Fibers? How much is driven by a change in pricing versus maybe a weaker demand environment? Or just trying to gauge how much that type of break through. Tim Nicholis : Yes. Hi Mike, this is Tim. I think obviously, prices has published now more than what we updated in the last quarter. So the bulk of it is price is both priced on the index and then as I referenced in the speaker comments, export pricing and spot pricing in the pulp business. There is some impact from volume because of the destocking, it\u2019s taken a little bit longer, but the bulk of it is price. And on a proportional basis, GCF has had more frequent and higher levels of price reductions on the index than what we anticipated or what had been published when we updated last quarter. Mike Roxland : Got it. Thank you Tim. And then just quickly, just in terms of some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve pursued in Global Cellulose Fibers, I believe looking at your prior forecast, I don\u2019t think we anticipated that an additional 100-plus ton decline and fluff pulp pricing, obviously, get better than we expected in that segment. So, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know Mark highlighted some of the things that you\u2019re working on, but was there anything in particular that occurred in GCF during the quarter that allowed you to achieve that level of EBITDA despite the fact that prices relatively declined? Mark Sutton : Mike, I\u2019m going to ask Clay Ellis to talk a little bit about how they\u2019re running in the business despite the soft demand and some of those improvements are really just in the operational side of it running well at a reduced demand environment. Clay, if you can share a couple of things about the second quarter [indiscernible] overcome some of the price headwinds? Clay Ellis : Great question, Mike. Thank you. This is Clay Ellis. Yes, I think, you mentioned coming into the second quarter, what we thought about demand or net price and the amount of EDT that we took, we came into the \u2013 exited the first quarter, believing that we would see most of the inventory destocking issues subside through the quarter. We did not see that as we expected. We\u2019ve begun to see some improvement June being better than May, July being better than June. And August is also looking better. So it\u2019s improving, but it\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing now, we hope to see earlier in the second quarter the things that we\u2019re focused on maximizing cash generation, managing our machine downtime, you may have seen we\u2019ve idled our Pensacola Mill to consolidate some EDT there, allow the other mills to run a little bit more of a normal ray [ph] that\u2019s overall better for our cost. Supply chain, aggressive supply chain cost and driving out costs there as Tim mentioned, minimizing our fiber costs, maximizing green energy sales and carbon credit sales. And then also increasing our pull byproduct sales and production. So pulling all of the levers to manage our cash costs and our marginal costs in the business as \u2013 but we see improving through the third quarter destocking, we certainly in the second half we see of the year to get out of that in the meantime, we\u2019re doing everything that we can on cost and then also looking as Tim and Mark mentioned around our business, our mix and mitigating some of our exposure to commodity grades. Mike Roxland : Got it. Great. Thank you very much for that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mark Weiintraub with Seaport Research. Go ahead. Mark Weiintraub : Thank you. So the slide on or the slide on Page 7, very, very interesting slide. I was curious how you came about to put that together. Is that just conversations with customers? Do you do some sort of survey on that? And then are you seeing any sign in the metrics, be it shipments, be it bookings where this hopeful end to the destocking is translating into changing business as you look at what you registered in July and maybe thoughts on August? Mark Sutton : Mark, this is Mark. That\u2019s a great question. There is a qualitative piece to that slide and there\u2019s a quantitative piece that\u2019s internal and some other metrics we use. I\u2019ll ask Tom to kind of give you a perspective on what that slide kind of represents in terms of how we feel demand has been evolving and different spots in the supply chain that have been a hard for anybody and everybody to call in terms of where inventory actually resides along the value chain. So Tom, if you could share a bit on that. Tom Hamic : Sure. Right. Good morning, Mark. This is Tom Hamic. We take a subset of customers and that subset of customers is consistent of [indiscernible] we talked to them about how they see their demand patterns, but also what their inventory levels are for not only boxes, but finished goods. And so that\u2019s what you see flowing through here. It\u2019s not \u2013 we have a representative sample, but it\u2019s not 60% of the customer base. It\u2019s kind of leaders in the segments that we look at. I think when you talk about destocking, it\u2019s been pretty consistent flowing through our system like we expected. And I think what you can see going back to Q4 is that consistency is based on the customer feedback. So these both pieces are matching up very well. We\u2019re going to \u2013 we finished Q2 about where we expected, so we was up 2% sequentially in terms of shipments per day and we\u2019re seeing an improvement into June, no, excuse me, into July of mid-single digits. So I think that\u2019s very reflective of kind of this curve of destocking or overstocking going away over time. Mark Weiintraub : Super. And so that, that\u2019s sequential and so the comps are getting easier too, I believe so. So is it fair to say that on a year-over-year basis it\u2019s even better than the mid-single digits? Tom Hamic : Well, the mid-single digit is a positive from quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s sequential. I think that that ties out to about a flat to minus 2% growth in the third quarter or in really more July. So we flowed through more strongly through the second quarter that\u2019s continuing now, and I think that is a pretty good representation of how our customers are viewing it. Mark Weiintraub : Right. Thank you that, that I misstated, thank you for getting that. And then just in terms of, in pulp, you idle to consolidate downtime and obviously you took huge amounts of downtime in containerboard during the second quarter. And even with things ramping up, it does seem like there\u2019s a big gap between your capacity to produce and the demand. Are you looking at idling to consolidate downtime in the containerboard business or have you done anything there yet? Mark Sutton : That\u2019s a really good question, Mark. I \u2013 we kind of anticipated that, that question. What you see is a perfect example of the specific back patterns in two different parts of international paper. What Clay described is the best cost position for GCF was to take the Pensacola Mill down and then maximize production at the other mills. The \u2013 those mills are a 100% virgin fiber, so the marginal cost actions you have to take at the other mills to load them up. And the fact that you can sell green energy when you\u2019re running full at those mills led us to one set of decisions. So far in containerboard because the marginal cost profile of the other containerboard mills, the ones you wouldn\u2019t idle permanently or completely involve a huge mix of we\u2019re 65, 35 urgent and recycle. So you ramp up recycled fiber, you have physical logistics challenges based on where the other mills are. So far, we believe the way we\u2019ve been doing it for IP for our containerboard system has resulted in the lowest marginal cost. There\u2019s a question mark though about the duration of this type of mismatch between our capacity and our order book. And as we learn more about that and we now believe we\u2019ve seen the bottom of the demand decline in destocking, we will then evaluate what does the upturn look like? And then if there\u2019s a different decision to be made and marginal cost have changed through the year where it\u2019s not as expensive to load up those other mills, you would see us make a different decision. And so that, that\u2019s how we try to operate it. And you can see an example of two different methods in two different parts of the same company that have different marginal cost attributes based on the products we\u2019re making. Mark Weiintraub : Very clear and helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi everybody. Thanks for the details and great operating performance in the quarter. Mark and Tom, a question for you. So to the extent that we have data and it\u2019s certainly not a perfect analog for what you\u2019d be seeing in the box market, nonetheless, scanner data, retail takeaway remains relatively weak. And obviously a lot of what drives the box market is consumer non-durables. It\u2019s the center of the store. So what are your customers telling you in terms of what is happening at retail and sell through and takeaway relative to hopefully what\u2019s an uptick now in their purchase patterns from you and through the supply chain loading the center of the store? Tom Hamic : Sure. George, this is Tom. I \u2013 we look at scanner data as well, but we also look at we try and push it down to what is box intensive, so what uses boxes. Our analysis would suggest that the retail channel of that space is somewhere between minus 2% year-over-year and plus 1%. The difficulty obviously is taking the revenue line, which is what you normally get, and then, okay, what is inflation for this set of goods? But if you take a broad range that\u2019s about where it comes out, I would say that when you look at the perishability of the segments, so think of a segment that produce that\u2019s been the most resilient, that\u2019s been our strongest segment exiting Q3 relative to the past. But the ones that are struggling are exactly what you said non-durables and durables. And I think it\u2019s because the shelf life is so long that they built up their supply chain and cover for risk. And now obviously they\u2019re going to have to pull it down further. But I don\u2019t think that the health of the consumer beyond the goods recession that we\u2019ve talked about will negatively impact box demand in a material way. George Staphos : Okay. That\u2019s very interesting. So there the fact that you\u2019ve got such large shelf life, and I also I guess for that matter, the supply chain opening up that allows customers to really take down their inventories on the stuff that can stay the lumps on the shelf because they probably have the most of that and they\u2019re saying consumer isn\u2019t going into a shell from what you\u2019re seeing on the retail side. Would that be a fair summary of what you\u2019re saying? Tom Hamic : I think that\u2019s exactly right. I mean, I think about the classic motor oil in the department store, that\u2019s not going to time out, but during the pandemic, you could see people stocking that type of thing up. And so I think you\u2019ve got multiple places where people talk. George Staphos : Understood. My other question recognizing this is a bit tricky and you\u2019re not guiding on 2024, but here comes the question. So we know building a better IP, which you\u2019re doing very well on, congratulations we will add, I think you said from the slide another 150 to 125 next year. If we look at what the price index change that have occurred to date, making no further assumptions one way or another going forward, what would the impact of that be into 2024 in terms of EBITDA? We know what your guidance is. We know what building a better IP does. What is the effect of prior price changes on EBITDA for next year, and what is the \u2013 what do you have in the back pocket in terms of all the operating efficiencies, all the optimization that you\u2019ve done as well as you look out to 2024? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter. Tim Nicholls : Hey George, it\u2019s Tim. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s a tricky question, but I\u2019ll give it a shot\u2026 George Staphos : But who better interest than you, Tim, so? Tim Nicholls : Yes. Thanks, George. So we look at the price carryover impact but I hesitate to quantify it for a lot of reasons, but one in particular is just we\u2019re sorting through mix and mix is going to change and so the price impact won\u2019t be the same on a different mix than the one that we had as the price has changed. In terms of initiatives, I think you heard characterized on the call all of the things that we\u2019re working on in the moment, but there are also strategic initiatives that we\u2019re working on that are going to drive better results on the commercial side and also on the call side. So I \u2013 we typically give our outlook when we do the fourth quarter call at the beginning of the year. And I think we\u2019ll stick to that, but we feel pretty good about what\u2019s going on in the company and the way of self-help that will mitigate that carryover that that that we\u2019re going to see as we go into 2024. George Staphos : Okay. We appreciate it. We\u2019ll turn over. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from Cleve Rueckert with UBS. Go ahead. Cleve Rueckert : Great, thanks very much for taking the questions and good morning everybody. I just want to follow-up on George\u2019s question, it was kind of asked a little bit differently earlier as well, but just sort of thinking about bigger picture the next couple of years. What really needs to happen to drive the earnings recovery that you\u2019ve been looking for? I mean, I think the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve talked about this cyclicality and you\u2019ve said a couple of times you feel like you\u2019ve got the capacity in the system that you need versus volume expectations. I mean, it sounds like that\u2019s still the case, but are we talking about a pricing recovery? Is volume kind of enough to get you there? I mean, what are kind of the drivers that you\u2019re going to be evaluating in the second half year? Mark Sutton : Hi Cleve, this is Mark. That\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s not one thing. I think what we need to see the earnings recovery is the kind of structure between price and cost, which obviously has a volume component to it that drives our margin structure back north of 20%. So what we do to track that is we look at \u2013 in the case of packaging, we used to be there a lot of the time. In the case of this GCF business, we were \u2013 we\u2019re working our way to that kind of margin structure that yields \u2013 returns that are well above at least 200 basis points above cost of capital. And so what we do is we break that down into just a simple EBITDA per ton for everybody to focus on. And there are components of that number that are purely commercial, who we sell to and at what price that are somewhat macro related, i.e., the amount of volume available in the market that we can compete for. And then there\u2019s the wealth of areas to work on in the cost area. And what\u2019s changed for IP is the demand that really ramped up and pulled forward was accompanied by a number of price increases that it took us longer to get them through based on the customer mix we had and contractual responsibilities. But the inflationary impact of our cost structure didn\u2019t wait for that. So we had a classic margin squeeze that we have to undo now. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s got to happen. Obviously, a lot of it is a market that is not declining at the rate it started to decline. For all the reasons we talked about, maybe not the end consumer, but the destocking effect and all of that. That started about this time last year or in August of last year in earnest. And it\u2019s hard to get out from under that quickly when you\u2019ve got sticky inflation that has flowed through to labor cost and all of those things in your supply chain. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s got to happen in most of those efforts. We don\u2019t control the overall demand, but we are confident in both product lines being facing a long-term growth profile. What we do control is who we sell to and at what price and how we operate our manufacturing facilities to be first quartile type cost producer of these types of products. And so we\u2019ve got efforts and focus on all of those initiatives and I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll get back to the levels of earnings and returns and then grow from there. Cleve Rueckert : Okay. That\u2019s \u2013 yes, that\u2019s pretty clear, sort of a little bit of a vague question for me to ask, but thanks for the clarity and well \u2013 and just the insight into your thought process. And then maybe just one quick follow-up, just sort of sticking with the volumes in the packaging business, I think you said sequentially on the bridge, it\u2019s sort of a $5 million tailwind into the third quarter. And we\u2019re sort of starting to be able to figure out what\u2019s implied for the fourth quarter. But are we just \u2013 am I correct in assuming that your expectations on volume growth in the second half are relatively low, I mean, in this flat to up slightly kind of environment that we\u2019re talking about for July? Mark Sutton : Are you talking about box volumes or overall... Cleve Rueckert : Yes. One in the packaging -- in the packaging business. Mark Sutton : Well, I\u2019ll ask Tom to comment on the box side and Jay Royalty is also here to talk about what we\u2019re seeing on container board in our other channels \u2013 the open market and the export channel. So Tom, if you want to start? Tom Hamic : Yes, I think we\u2019re going to see through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, getting back to normal. I think this destocking is a big effect. And so we expect the demand to normalize and you\u2019ll see a much better second half of the year, substantially better second half of the year than the first half relative to year-over-year. And I think somebody pointed out that the year-over-year comps get easier, but even with that, we see continued strengthening through the balance of the year. Jay Royalty : This is Jay Royalty. So commenting on the open market domestic channel and the export channel, I would say that, relative to the domestic channel, it\u2019s \u2013 both of these have been a big drag on us from a demand standpoint thus far this year. But we are seeing improvement in both of those channels. From a domestic standpoint, we did see some modest improvement in the second quarter, and based on our order books, we\u2019re continuing to see \u2013 we\u2019re encouraged about the improvements in the third quarter. If you think about those type of customers and their orientation, they\u2019re less orient to food customers. And so from a destocking standpoint, I think they\u2019ve been hit harder and as that unwinds, we\u2019ll have the opportunity for more pickup. So we\u2019re encouraged there. From an export standpoint, the first half of the year has been incredibly weak. As I mentioned last quarter, we started to see some stabilization in inventory levels and some improvement in order patterns, particularly related to Latin America. We saw that flow through in the second quarter, the encouraging thing is we\u2019re seeing improvement across all three regions, Asia, EMEA and Latin America as we go into the third quarter. And if you look at our run rate based on our current order bookings out through August, we\u2019re seeing about a 200,000 ton pickup in the run rate of the second half versus the first half. And that\u2019s evidenced in our order pattern. So \u2013 and we\u2019ve got room to grow from there. So I think in both cases, we\u2019re encouraged about what we\u2019re seeing at this time and how that can flow through for the second half. Cleve Rueckert : That\u2019s very clear. Thank you so much for all the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Your question \u2013 next question comes to the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I just had a question on the updated free cash flow guidance and specifically, with regards to the dividend. You\u2019ve talked about, the commitment to maintain the dividend and targeting 40% to 50% of, I think, free cash flow over time. With the dividend payment, I think coming in above the midpoint of the free cash flow guide, just how do we think about levers that you can pull or sort of capital allocation priorities or ways that you can kind of balance that this year and going forward and how that maybe changes the approach a little bit. Mark Sutton : Anthony, this is Mark. I\u2019ll start on that. Just on the dividend question, it\u2019s a very fair question. It\u2019s one we get, if you just look at the numbers and the map, the long-term plan is 40% to 50% of free cash flow. We know that occasionally that\u2019ll be tested and this is kind of a really odd set of cyclical dynamics that are really testing it, but we\u2019re very confident in the medium and long-term cash flow potential, the generation potential of the company. And if the dividend is at the upper end of a range for a short period of time, we\u2019re comfortable with that. We know we can grow back into it with future cash flows. So as Tim said in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re committed to the dividend. That\u2019s what that means. It\u2019s not just a formulaic commitment for international paper. We believe in talking with our shareholders, especially the people who hold our shares for a long period of time, the dividend\u2019s very important to them. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to it, not just when it\u2019s easy and it fits into a metric, but we\u2019re committed to it in good times and we\u2019re committed to it in stress times. And as far as the levers to pull and what happened with the guidance and what we could do that we\u2019re not doing, I\u2019ll ask Tim to comment a little bit on that. But just so I\u2019m clear on how we think about the dividend. We don\u2019t get nervous when we\u2019re at the upper end, just like we don\u2019t look at arbitrarily doing something when we\u2019re on the lower end that might be also a cyclical dynamic. It\u2019s something that we believe we can handle over time and that we\u2019ll grow very nicely back into a more normal range. Tim, if you would add a few comments on the second part of this question about levers to pull. Tim Nicholls : Sure. Hey, Anthony. Just a couple of points that I think are important. First of all, as we referenced the $500 million to $600 million includes the settlement payment for timber monetization, which was almost $200 million in the first quarter. And so that\u2019s a one-time item and not to repeat. The other item is we\u2019re going to invest more capital this year than we have since before the pandemic. And at the beginning of the year, we put out a range of 1 to 1.2 really with the \u2013 normally, we\u2019re tighter than that, but just given supply chain delays and difficulties, we had struggled to invest as much as we wanted the past couple of years. And so anticipating that it could be that way, again, it was kind of the 1 billion and things freed up, it could be as high as 1.2. Well, things have freed up and so we tighten the range, we\u2019re later in the year of course, but we tighten the range and the way projects are being deployed, it could push that upper limit on 1.2. So I think that\u2019s important relative to the free cash flow. On the go forward basis, it\u2019s back to what we were talking about earlier in terms of initiatives, a big portion of the initiatives we\u2019re working on are cost. And so we think we\u2019re getting traction on that and we think there\u2019s a lot more to call back. Working capital is something we focus on pretty intently. And then capital if we need to we have \u2013 and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated this over the years, we have an ability to flex our capital spend in moments. And certainly, that would be a consideration as well. So hopefully that helps. Mark Sutton : Yes. I think Tim, that was exactly what I was something you would cover is that we have the levers, we can pull them if and when we want to, but I\u2019ll just finish that point that Tim made about the investments. A lot of the investments that we\u2019re doing now. Unlike in the past, are in our box business, in our converting operations. And so you ask why am I confident about future cash flows is because those investments we\u2019re making today will produce a lot of those future cash flows in 2024, 2025 and 2026. And so it\u2019s not a lot of the spending on normal maintenance and normal protection of current cash flows, a fair amount of it is about future cash flows. And that's what's different about the quality of the capital investment number that Tim cited versus maybe in the past where we were doing some things that needed to be done, but didn't have a real connection to a lot of future cash flows. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. That's very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then I guess, just a question maybe somewhat related, but in terms of the competitive landscape in containerboard and corrugated. We've obviously seen a number of capacity additions this year, which I think most of which are up and running. And I guess without speaking about any specific competitor or a company. Is it possible to talk about sort of the impact of this capacity maybe relative to your expectations? I mean, has it been more disruptive, less disruptive sort of as expected is the impact sort of already maybe absorbed in the market? Is it something that is going to be felt more in the second half? I'm just wondering if you could just generally talk how this new capacity has been absorbed in the market and how you kind of see the overall competitive landscape here? Jay Royalty : Hey Anthony, it's Jay Royalty. Yes, it's a great question. I think from our vantage point we continue to wonder where these tons are going because we're not seeing a lot of evidence of it in \u2013 in our space, in our customer space. I'll take you back to \u2013 at the end of the day, customers \u2013 our customers buy boxes and that requires a complex set of needs and a complex offering. And so if you think about some of these new entrants, they're coming in with kind of a single singular and a limited set of offerings in terms of 1 mill limited grades that cannot fulfill all their needs. And so when we think about our relationships with our customers, we're bringing a more robust offering, multiple grades, redundancy in our supply chain and our manufacturing system to help them fulfill all of those needs and we structure our relationships accordingly. So that's what they're up against in terms of competing with a company like International Paper. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Gabe Hajde : Mark, Tim, good morning. I apologize in advance for the long windy question here. But I'm looking back at 2021, 2022, where there was a cumulative, I think in the Industrial Packaging business, $2.8 billion of price realized. And if I take the $24 million year-over-year in the second quarter plus the $95 million, I think that you talked about on a sequential basis, I know it doesn't work exactly this way, but on a year-over-year, we're sort of implying down $125 million-ish. Has something changed, like when I think about the 80% of the business is vertically integrated of your corrugated converted, maybe 80% of that is [indiscernible] linked. You guys have talked about commercial initiatives. Has anything changed with respect to that lag in the pass-through and maybe it's shorter or longer than it used to be? And I guess, relatedly will we be at sort of \u2013 based on what [indiscernible] have transpired at run rate negative price in Q3? And I'll take one stab at it. And if I were to summarize what you guys have said thus far, if we make an assumption about what the negative price roll through for next year might look like based on what you see in terms of maybe an improvement in volumes and improvement in operating rates and cost out, that Industrial Packaging segment EBIT to be flattish with 2023? Tim Nicholls : So Gabe, I appreciate the preference of the long question, if you would take out some of these questions, and I gave up halfway through. Big picture, what was different about the last price changes in the market and for IP that is different from what you would consider more normal is the rate of price movement, meaning three in a 12-month period, that type of thing was different for us. Some of our commercial arrangements had been constructed anticipating more like one price increase a year, with maybe two limits on how fast you can go through. So in some cases, we were still getting price increases this year, in some customers that the last price increase was early last year and it started declining in the fall. That was atypical in terms of a set of conditions. So the flow-through and the realization schedule looked a little different for IP than it has in the past. The balance of your question about going forward, I couldn't keep up with all of it. I would ask maybe just following up with Mark and IR to try to kind of model out what you were talking about in terms of the flow-through. And I think you used the term when we go price negative, but I'm not sure I followed all of that. But that's the one critical thing to think about is the rate of increases and the type of mix we have with a portion of our customer base, which that same customer base is more resilient right now, which is one of the reasons we're performing pretty well in the market on an absolute basis is because those types of customers tend to be market leaders with that come some additional challenges on abnormal commercial times like rapid price increases and those kind of things. Gabe Hajde : Okay. Thank you. And appreciating that it's tough to talk about it live like this; but I saw an article yesterday talking about some of the differences or vagaries of how paper businesses are performing in Russia? Again, the thing you can comment, could anything change with respect to the process there? And if things go sort of as planned, can you give us an update in terms of timing as to when the cash might come in? Mark Sutton : It's really, really hard to give you an update on the time. As we said, we lack one approval on the competition authorities and that's a multi-point \u2013 multipart approval. We've got all of those parts. And so I think with what's been going on in Russia, that's unrelated to foreign companies exiting and all that the things happen with \u2013 with the government and the military issues, I think it's a bit of a distraction factor for getting these kinds of jobs completed. I will say though, the IP Ilim transaction is on the larger end of things that have occurred. So it gets higher levels of scrutiny and the people doing the approvals are at a higher level, and they've obviously been really busy with other things not related to this. So I wish I could give you a better timing. Our partners who are the potential buyers are working it constantly. They're working their normal contacts with the government, trying to get it to the finish line. If I gave you a prediction, it would just be an educated gas, which as we know is not \u2013 is not worth much. And Tim, if you want to add something to that? Tim Nicholls : Just, I think Mark is right, the timing on the approval is impossible in the gauge. Once approval were to be obtained, the flow-through on closing the transaction or preceding cash is very clear. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Matthew McKellar with RBC. One moment while we open your line. Go ahead, please. Matthew McKellar : Hi. Thanks, good morning. I'd like to ask about your Global Cellulose Fibers business. So recognizing you talked about your focus on customers who value the attributes of your fluff pulp. Maybe thinking about the market more broadly, can you talk about any impact you've seen over the past few quarters from certain consumers substituting lower-cost grades? And then maybe whether you're seeing any changes in that substitution date with fluff pulp pricing coming off peak? Thanks. Mark Sutton : Matt, that's a good question. Clay and his team are all over really understanding this whole substitution phenomenon. Clay, if you can comment on what we know about that and how [indiscernible]. Clay Ellis : Yes. Sure. Hello, Matt. This is Clay Ellis. Yes, I think it's a good question. There's always been some level of substitution in local markets and areas of China tick in the supply chain disruption in 2022 really drove more of that. I mean, these are customers in some geographies and segments. And these were customers that were very tailend of the supply chain couldn't actually get the product. And so I think that drove a higher rate of substitution. These are segments and some geographies where brands and high-quality product performance are not this critical. I think about an example that might would be like pet pads in parts of China. These are not our core customer base. And in this part of the market, we think we'll ebb and flow with substitution over time as their economics allow a little less regard to quality and product performance technical specs as the broader fluff market. So again, we think it's a \u2013 it's a very small segment of the fluff market. Clearly, it went up in the first half of the year. We saw that increase, but also nearing the end of the second quarter, as you mentioned as price has changed and spot market prices change, we also saw a lot of that come back out. So again, we think it's there. We understand it. We know where it is and how it's done. We don't think it's likely to grow very broadly. But it's not a new phenomenon, but clearly it \u2013 it increased due to the supply chain and it's been stickier due to the price differential in their economics. Matthew McKellar : Great. Thanks very much. That's all from me. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Sutton for closing remarks. Mark Sutton : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for your time today and for your continued interest in International Paper. We outlined some exciting initiatives that are focused on the future of the company and catalyst for some of our future earnings growth. So I look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. Have a great day. Operator : And once again, we'd like to thank you for your participating in today's International Paper Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you Mark and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on slide 3 where I will highlight our results. In the third quarter, our teams across International Paper executed well with intense focus on optimizing our cost structure while taking care of our customers. Looking at our performance, we delivered on the earnings outlook we provided last quarter and we continued our efforts to drive out the highest marginal cost across our system. In addition, International Paper for delivered $75 million of year-over-year incremental earnings benefits from our building a better IP initiative. Year-to-date this program has contributed $195 million in benefits, exceeding our full year target for the second year in a row. Our performance was driven by commercial and process improvement initiatives which I will highlight later during the call. We're also encouraged to see that the demand environment continued to recover across our portfolio in the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue going forward. Despite these improvements, I'm not satisfied with our absolute level of earnings. Therefore, we are taking additional actions to further strengthen our businesses and improve profitability. I will share more details regarding these initiatives later in the presentation. However, before we move off this topic, I'd like to share my perspective on the series of strategic actions we announced last week to optimize our mill system and reduce fixed costs. These actions include the permanent closure of our container board mill in Orange, Texas and two pulp machines, including one at our Riegelwood, North Carolina Mill and the other at our Pensacola, Florida Mill. While these actions will help us achieve our objectives, they are incredibly difficult to make because of the impact on our team members, their families and the surrounding communities. We are truly grateful to our team members at Orange, Riegelwood and Pensacola for their contributions to IP over the years and we are committed to supporting them through this transition while continuing to serve our customers. I'd also like to update you on another strategic action completed in the quarter. We completed our sale, the sale of our ownership interest in the Ilim Joint Venture in Russia. Proceeds from the sale total $508 million as expected. With the completion of this sale, International Paper no longer has any investment in Russia. I will now turn it over to Tim who will provide more details about our third quarter performance and our outlook. Tim? Tim Nicholls : Thank you, Mark. Turning to our third quarter key financials on slide 4, operating earnings per share increased sequentially and came in better than the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to optimize our system through commercial and operational initiatives and we also benefited from lower employee benefit cost and on lower effective tax rate. Operating margins continue to be under pressure from macroeconomic headwinds, impacting sales price and volumes. However, margins improve quarter-over-quarter driven by more favorable operating costs and lower outage expense. Moving to the third quarter sequential earnings bridge on slide 5, third quarter operating earnings per share was $0.64 as compared to $0.59 in the second quarter. Price and mix were lower by $0.35 per share are primarily due to index movements across our portfolio and lower export sales prices. Volume was relatively stable overall as higher volumes across our container board export channel and global sales fibers business offset one less shipping day in our North American packaging business. Operations and cost improved earnings by $139 million or $0.30 per share. During the quarter, our mill system did very well and our teams across the businesses continued their focus on reducing marginal cost and spending. We're accomplishing this by optimizing mix and usage of fiber and energy, reducing labor cost and overtime, shifting to lower cost suppliers and driving lower distribution costs. During the third quarter, we also had lower employee benefit costs totaling about $80 million or $0.18 per share, which was in our outlook provided last quarter and will not repeat in the fourth quarter. The balance is primarily due to lower unabsorbed fixed costs related to last economic downtime across our portfolio as demand improved. Maintenance outages were lower by $36 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Input costs were modestly higher as increased costs for energy and OCC were partially offset by lower costs for chemicals and wood, and corporate items benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on slide 6, price and mix was lower due to index movements, lower export prices, and higher export mix as demand improved. This was partially offset by benefits from commercial initiatives focused on margin improvement. Volume was stable overall despite one less shipping day in box. Container board shipments were higher across our export channels due to improved demand, and our daily US box shipments were stable slightly higher sequentially. Demand for packaging was also impacted by customer inventory destocking. However, based on customer feedback, we believe this is generally completed at the end of the third quarter. Operations and cost improved earnings by $103 million. This includes the benefit of $68 million from the non-repeat items I mentioned earlier. In addition, Ops and costs also benefited from lower economic downtime in the quarter as demand improved. Our mill system continued to run very reliably. And our teams across the businesses remain focused on reducing the highest marginal cost and spending while further optimizing our entire supply chain to align with the customer demand environment. For example, by optimizing fiber, energy mix, and raw materials, we've reduced the cost of economic downtime by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. We also have significant efforts underway to improve distribution costs, including initiatives to minimize high cost freight carriers, improve contract rates and load efficiencies, and shed warehouse and demerged expenses. These efforts have lowered our supply chain costs by approximately $40 million on an annualized basis. And there's more opportunities in this area as we go forward. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $34 million sequentially due to a seasonally lower outage schedule and our efforts to further reduce outage spending in the current demand environment. Input costs were moderately higher, primarily due to the higher cost for energy and OCC, partly offset by lower costs for chemicals. Turning to the Global Cellulose Fibers on slide 7 and looking at our third quarter performance price and mix was lower due to price index movements, partially offset by the benefits from higher fluff mix. Volume was higher in the third quarter as demand for fluff improved. This was partially offset by lower sales of commodity grades as we continued to focus on strategically aligning our business with the most attractive customers and segments. The destocking trend continued in the third quarter as improvement across supply chains allowed customers to manage more lean inventory levels. Based on feedback from our customers and from order bookings, we believe de-stocking was largely completed in the third quarter. We also believe fluff demand will continue to grow over time because of the essential role that absorbent personal care products play in meeting consumer needs. Operations and cost improved earnings by $36 million. This includes benefit of $12 million from the non-repeat items I mentioned earlier. Ops and costs also benefited from strong operational performance, lower supply chain costs, lower spending, and higher energy sales as our teams remained focused on optimizing the entire value chain. Planned maintenance outages were relatively flat sequentially and input costs were lower by $5 million primarily due to lower wood and chemical costs. Turning to slide 8 and our fourth quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $60 million as a result of prior index movement in North America and lower average export prices based on declines to date. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $20 million due to sequentially higher box volumes despite one less shipping day and an increase in container board export shipments. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million. This is due to the non-repeat of favorable employee benefit costs I mentioned earlier, partially offset by lower unobserved fix related to higher volumes and benefits from our ongoing cost management initiatives. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $21 million. And lastly, rising input costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million, driven by higher OCC costs, partially offset by lower costs for energy, wood and other raw materials. Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $25 million as a result of prior index movements. Overall volume is expected to increase earnings by $5 million. We expect higher fluff volumes due to improving demand, offset by lower shipments of commodity grades as we execute our mix optimization strategy. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $35 million relative to the third quarter. Approximately half of this is due to the non-repeat of favorable employee benefit costs I discussed earlier; the remainder due to higher planned maintenance outage costs in the fourth quarter. Higher maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease earnings by $28 million. Lastly, lower input costs are expected to increase earnings by $5 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Tim. I\u2019ll start on slide 9, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are making solid progress with our Building a Better IP program, which has delivered a total benefit of $195 million a year-to-date, exceeding our original target for the second year in a row. This year, most of the benefits are coming from our strategy acceleration initiatives. Our business teams are focused on creating value for our customers while improving the profitability of our product and service offerings again paid for what value we provide to our customers, and by also growing in the most attractive segments with the most attractive customers and in the most attractive geographic regions. We have also seen meaningful benefits from our process optimization initiatives. By leveraging advanced technologies and big data across our large system, our teams are identifying new ways to improve productivity and lower costs. I'm excited about our progress and in the next couple of slides I'll share some examples of the actions our business teams are taking to drive profitable growth. So turning to slide 10, I'll start with Industrial Packaging. Beginning with commercial excellence. International Paper has a broad range of capabilities and segment tailored packaging solutions to serve our customers. Our commercial teams are leveraging these advantages to improve mix by strategically aligning with the most attractive regions, segments and customers. Our teams are also using more advanced data analytics to manage product pricing across our sales territories. This allows them to capture more value for customer tailored product and service offerings. Under operational excellence we are leveraging advanced technology and data analytics to improve efficiencies and lower costs across our large system of mills and box plants. We are seeing benefits in areas such as maintenance and reliability, raw material consumption, distribution and logistics and sourcing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're also taking actions to optimize our bill system and reduce fixed costs. The mill closures will improve annual EBITDA for industrial packaging by about $140 million. Turning to slide 11, I'll highlight some of the things we're doing in the area of investment excellence. Due to the attractive long-term fundamentals of our industrial packaging business, we believe we have investment opportunities to drive profitable growth and create significant value. Strategic capital investments in our mill system have targeted productivity improvements and product capability enhancements that align with customer needs and market trends. Added capabilities for lightweight and ultra lightweight liners and high quality version whitetop products are examples of these investments. More recently our strategic investments are focused on our box business. These investments allow us to grow with customers and increase profitability by strengthening our capabilities, improving productivity, and leveraging automation. We believe we can create the most value through organic investments across our large network of box plants. Examples of this include adding converting lines in existing plants and upgrading older equipment with newer and more advanced technology. For some context, the investments we have made over the past two years in existing plants is the equivalent of adding almost three average size box plants to our system. We will supplement this strategy with additional investments in greenfield box plants and occasionally with bolt-on M&A where we can create additional value by addressing regional needs and enhancing our business. I'd also like to recognize that in September we celebrate the grand opening of our new greenfield box plant in Atglen, Pennsylvania, which has a great team and world class capabilities. Our investment will allow us to optimize our network of plants in the northeast while providing additional capacity for future growth. In summary, we have significant opportunity to leverage these new investments as well as our market expertise to grow with customers, improve our mix, and capture additional value. Turning to slide 12, I'll share some key opportunities in our Global Cellulose Fibers business. Over the past year, we have captured meaningful benefits from commercial actions which contributed to our Building a Better IP results. Our commercial teams renegotiated large contracts to ensure we get paid for value that we provide. In addition, we have earned a higher premium for fluff grades relative to commodity pulps by capturing more value and aligning with those customer segments and regions who value our differentiated product and service offerings. However, the benefits of our commercial strategy are currently being masked by a very challenging and unprecedented business cycle, as well as our exposure to commodity grades. On a positive note, the market environment began recovering in the third quarter as demand for fluff pulp improved, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we believe there are more strategic levers to pull to increase the earnings potential of this business. Through our go-to-market strategy, we have an opportunity to improve our mix by reducing our exposure to commodity grades and by serving the most attractive fluff customers and markets that allow us to maximize the value of this business. Aligning with this strategy, we are taking actions to right-size our footprint and reduce fixed costs across the system. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we announced the closure of two pulp machines, which will improve EBITDA for the global cellulose fibers business by approximately $90 million. I believe there is a good business within this business. And that we can continue to grow earnings and cash flows over the cycle. We have talented teams with significant market expertise and a mill system with a broad set of capabilities. This allows us to create value for our customers by delivering innovation and products that meet their stringent performance and product safety standards. Now I'll turn to slide 13. We continue to see demand recovery across the markets we serve and we strongly believe in the attractive long-term fundamentals of our businesses. At International Paper, we are taking actions to improve earnings and drive profitable growth. Given our strategic customer relationships, talented teams, world-class assets, market expertise and strong financial foundation, I'm confident in our value-creating opportunities and IP\u2019s continued success. And with that we're happy to take questions. And similar to last quarter, our senior business leaders are joining Tim and I to provide their perspectives as well. So operator, we're ready to move to the Q &A section of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Gabe Hajde : Mark, Tim, good morning. Thank you for all the detail. Wanted to ask a little bit about the Orange closure and I guess as we look into 2024, I guess the first one would be as the market begins to recover, would you expect than and even with this closure to kind of grow with the market and again taking into account a lot of your own commercial initiatives or is that something that might be on a little bit of a delayed timetable? Mark Sutton : Gabe, I'll ask Jay Royalty to comment, but at a high level, looking at all the variables around demand and our recent capacity investments that I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we feel good about being able to make this change and continue to grow with the market. I mean, essentially, with this level of downturn, there's been somewhat of a reset and I think the market demand signal will engage again and we have options for future container board investments. So, Jay, I don't know if you want to add any commentary on how we're thinking about the near term ability to grow. Jay Royalty : Sure. Good morning, Gabe. Thanks, Mark. First of all, our long-term view of demand has not changed. So this was more about kind of how we see the near term and options we have. If you think about where we are, we've been matching our supply to our customer's demand and running the system as effectively as we can for quite a while now. And all along that way, we've been evaluating our options and trying to develop an informed point of view on a couple of things. One is demand and the shape of the recovery. And secondly would be where do we think the market is headed and what capabilities do we need for the future? And both of those factors influenced our decision to reset the mill system, as Mark said. We have a large low-cost fleet with tremendous flexibility and capability. And so when you think about that, we're able to close Orange without compromising our ability to serve customers and we have what we need for the short term and midterm. When you think about the amount of EDT we were taking and even with this closure, we still have room to grow. And then when we think about the future, we do have options to grow in the right product ranges at the right time. And as you heard, this move in the near term allows us to run the system in a more optimized way. And all in lowers our cost structure by about $140 million. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then maybe one on the capital side. I'm assuming as you guys went through this exercise, it was just as much about maybe variable production costs as perhaps investments. But again, kind of peeking around the corner to \u201924, this year, you're projecting to spend a little bit above D&A. Is that something that you envision over the next, at least maybe again \u201824 or \u201825, if you're willing to comment, given maybe throttling back a little bit during the pandemic? Tim Nicholls : Yes, Hey, Gabe. Yes. Good morning, Gabe. It's Tim. So I think as you said, right around D&A and on a normalized basis, I think that's where we are for the foreseeable future. Some years higher, some years lower. We haven't finished our planning work for next year yet to have a specific thought about what the level will be there. So we'll complete that over the next month or so. And then in January, when we release, we'll have more to say about 2024 and how we're thinking about capital at that point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I was just wondering if you had a sort of updated view on the full year adjusted EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow guide. You provided that, I think in previous slides, if there's updated view for \u201823. Tim Nicholls : Yes, we showed it at the second quarter and then third quarter actuals, and now we've given a fourth quarter outlook. And but the short answer is there's no material change in any of the categories that we provided a full year, a full year outlook for. We're still solidly in the EBITDA range, right in line with capital and cash flow the same way. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of box shipments, can you talk about the cadence of North American box volumes, maybe during the quarter and then touch on the trends in October? And then I think seasonally, there's usually like a little bit of an uptick in September. Did you see demand that you think was stronger than normal seasonality or how would you sort of describe that dynamic? Tom Hamic : Hey, Anthony. This is Tom Hamic. Just in terms of demand, we troughed or had a trough in Q1 like Q4. We've seen continued improvement from that time and that lasted through Q3. So we felt very good about the improvement through Q3. A lot of segments seem to stabilize in Q3 and we think they're going to improve in Q4. So think about beverage and processed food. Really strong stabilization in Q3, improvement into Q4. E-commerce, stabilization in Q3, improvement into Q4. So we feel good about the trend. I think you asked about October. We're very close. If you look at the order book, which is the best way of kind of looking forward, especially when you've got a month like October that can be a little bit misleading. I would put the order book growth at about 3% to 4%. And so we think that's going to improve as we go through the quarter. That's a sequential number. So think 4% to 5% for the quarter sequentially. So we see these segments in the market continuing to improve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. And given the announcements earlier in the quarter as well, just want to wish everyone the best during the management transition and Mark, especially to you for your leadership over this period. I wanted to go back to the deal heatmap slide, the outlook slide, and just make sure that we've got this correctly. So given our very quick tally of what you mentioned, Tim, are we -- are you suggesting EBITDA and I haven't done the rough and ready for cellulose fibers is, perhaps below breakeven and overall that we might be somewhere in the 400s relative to the to where we were in the third quarter. And then the second question that I had in terms of businesses and profitability, Europe is not your largest business. You've been there for a while. It generated about a 10% EBITDA margin. It's still relatively small. Strategically, how do you see that business mark over time? Are you happy with the profitability and what's its real role within the IP portfolio? And then I had one or two other follow-ups. Tim Nicholls : Yes, hey, George, it's Tim. So yes, I think generally speaking, you're in the zip code of how we're thinking about the fourth quarter. Of course, the IR team will talk you through all of the essentials and everything. But I think ballpark, it sounds like you're close. And with your \u2013 Mark Sutton : Yes. On the EMEA question, we like the business. We don't like the absolute performance, but we have doubled the earnings from \u201822 to \u201823 after they were hit so hard with high natural gas costs. And we've made some very successful single plan acquisitions over the last couple of years that's really built the density around the Madrid container board bill. So we view our Europe business as a regional strategy. It's mostly southern Europe. We think there's growth opportunity, but it's largely going to continue to come in that region. We think it has a long-term growth potential. It's a very attractive market. EBITDA margins to get good returns in Europe. George, remember, can be a bit lower than we're used to seeing in the U.S. because of the mill structure being mostly recycled. You have a lot less capital employed to generate the revenue line. So if you like 20% EBITDA margins here, low to mid-teens, get you the same return on invested capital. So it's a different capital structure. And we have $1.5 billion business for revenue basis there. So in the regions that we're in, we have pretty significant positions like the Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, we're a leader. We're significant in Italy and France. So I think long term, it fits IP and it gives us some growth factors in the packaging business that obviously is most of our company now. George Staphos : Understood. My follow on question just for the fluff pulp business, the machine closures that you announced, how quickly will that benefit the results within GCF? And in your longer-term outlook and your view that it's still got opportunities to create value. What effect, if any, how have you thought about perhaps some of the, I mean, it's come up in the past and calls the potential from eucalyptus based fluff, which there seems to be a bit more interesting again. How much does that take from the market as a market grow sufficiently so that you can keep growing and take advantage of all the commercial opportunities you have. Thank you, gentlemen. Clay Ellis : Hey, George. This is Clay Ellis. I'll be happy to try to take a stab at your questions. Good morning. Yes, I think the machine closures will occur in the fourth quarter. We'll have some residual personnel calls that extend into the first quarter of next year as we train and move folks around in that. But overall, that will mostly be complete in the first quarter. So I think that we'll see the benefits immediately and the benefits will ramp as you go through \u201824. And we still have, at Riegelwood, we will have a little bit of optimization work to do, very minimal cost that will have a big payback in getting our cost per ton optimized there. That will all happen early in \u201824. You're going to -- your comment on short fiber or eucalyptus, it's fluff. So eucalyptus fluff has been out, I think, most of this decade, seven, eight years. It's been in the market and been a pretty relatively small amount of the market hasn't had significant growth. To your point, there's interest and concern, and I think there always has been. I think as prices create, when prices got high and supply chains were constrained last year, there were probably more interest in it at that point about how do we look at a short fiber differently or more seriously. Again, we have that baked in. We think that the long-term view of fluff pulp and the growth is consistent in the future as it has been in the past. Long fiber has, is a reason why it's 90 plus percent of the market, and we think it will relatively stay in that range, and so does it materially change our view or outlook of the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weiintraub from Seaport Research. Mark Weiintraub : Good morning. A few follow-ons, if I could just a clarification really, and hopefully I'm not splitting hairs here, but first on that question on the bridge for EBITDA for the fourth quarter, you gave us very specific numbers and if I just take the 590 you had in the third quarter, and I think there was basically $117 million difference from what you, the numbers you provided for 4Q guidance, that puts me in the upper 400 as opposed to just more generically in the 400s, is that fair? Tim Nicholls : Yes, that's fair, Mark. Mark Weiintraub : Okay. And then second on the Orange, so the $140 million, does that primarily show up in 2024 as well? Or does it start to show up in the fourth quarter? And maybe just related to that. Is Orange down now or when does that get closed? Jay Royalty : Hey Mark, good morning, this is Jay. So we're working through the early stages of the transition and obviously there's a winddown that is underway as we speak. It's not down at this point. We do have to transition business and transition customers and work through all of the dynamics, but it did all of that will be complete in the fourth quarter. So we would expect to see that type of EBITDA impact fully recognized in 2024. Mark Weiintraub : Okay, super, thank you. And then maybe just a little bit of color. You talked about the export, containerboard export business getting better. And to a certain extent that sort of led us down and we have much more price erosion there than in the domestic business. Maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing there. And are we, I mean, again, pulp and paper, we posted prices lower in their review of what was going on with export pricing. Can you give us your perspective on what's happening kind of real time in those markets? Jay Royalty : Sure, Mark. This is Jay again. And if you go back to the last call, we spoke about starting to see some improvement in the export markets. And that definitely continued in the third quarter. So when you think about the major markets, we serve Latin America, Europe, Asia. We've seen inventories normalize in all of those markets at this point and we see demand continue to improve. Latin America continues to be very solid as we sell in the second quarter and that's being driven by bananas and pineapples, melons, these types of products. So very resilient. Europe, we saw a shift in a positive direction in the third quarter, rebounding. And that's been a fruit and vegetable driven as well, really in anticipation of a much better agricultural season beginning in early \u201824, late \u201823, early \u201824 versus last year. Asia is the market that continues to lag a bit but we're seeing recovery there as well. And so when you look at all of that and look through the fourth quarter, we see strong quarter bucks all the way through the end of the year. So we believe we've seen demand bottom and the outlook is certainly more encouraging. Mark Weiintraub : Okay, great. I recognize you guys aren't going to forecast prices here but it doesn't seem that this demand improvement has translated yet into better pricing. Is that a function of more supply out there chasing this business? Or any color you could help us with in that regard? Jay Royalty : Yes, I mean you have to see demand improvement to see the market turn. We're seeing that. There still is a supply demand imbalance, but that's shifting both because of actions that are being taken on the supply side as you know about and also this demand improvement. So at this point, we're as I said, we think we've seen demand bottom, the outlook's more encouraging. We'll see where it goes from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland from Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Thank you, Mark, Tim. And Mark for taking my questions. Just have one quick follow up on the Orange Texas closure. I do appreciate Jay's comments around that mill. But I do believe you mentioned a few quarters ago that a permanent capacity adjustment was not on the horizon. So I'm wondering what's transpired and what's happened in the last few quarters that has changed your approach? And then to think about your portfolio more broadly, to the extent you can comment and realizing that it may be difficult on this type of forum, but are there additional similar opportunities to further rationalize your portfolio? Mark Sutton : Mike, I'll take the first part because I'm the one who said we didn't have any permanent closures on the horizon. I think what I said was we look at permanent closures around secular declines and we don't believe we have that. I think what's changed is the depth and duration of this downturn. It's not like anything we've seen since we built the industrial packaging business starting in the mid-2000s. And we also, and Jay mentioned this. We also have a long-term plan for that business and the kinds of containerboard we need to make for the future, in some cases, is different than the containerboard we make today. We invested in high-quality whitetop at our Riverdale Mill. That's a future-looking product that makes a bleached pulp container board, not using recycled. So high quality, we've got basis weight and high performance, lightweight needs that our system can't address today for the future. So I think part of what allowed us to make this decision is the depth of this downturn and the duration and the fact that we need, over time, to change our product offering that we make boxes out of. So we're taking this opportunity to do a reset and then we have to get the timing of any future investment right. But that's what's changed. We still believe in the long-term fundamentals, as Jay said, about growth. Two quarters ago, I would not have thought we were still in this type of demand environment taking this type of economic downtime. Mike Roxland : Got it. And then, Mark, I appreciate the color. Just on my second part of that question, in terms of additional opportunities you may have or similar opportunities in the portfolio, similar Orange that you can rationalize, where does that stand? Jay Royalty : Hey, Mike. This is Jay. We've made this announcement. We came to it through a very thorough and extensive evaluation of both the commercial side as well as our fleet and capabilities. We're very comfortable with the decision that we've made and how it sets us up for the future. We still have room to grow and we're in this business to win and to grow, and the system that we will have moved forward will enable us to do that. Mike Roxland : Got it. Okay. And just one quick follow-up. Mark, can you help us understand the company's approach just going forward with respect to cost takeout and driving efficiencies? Obviously, kudos to you and the entire team for doing a terrific job with building a better IP initiative. But how do you ensure that you and the team were making laser focused on cost removal and improving efficiency, particularly as the cycle starts to inflect and demand gets to more notably improved? Mark Sutton : That's a great question, Mike. As part of the cost takeout is something that no one's really had to do before, meaning we had four year high inflation that's gotten stuck into a lot of our inputs. So that becomes a, not just using less, but that becomes a real commercial challenge just like with our customers on the sales side. In our global sourcing world, no one wants to give back any of the pricing they were going to get through \u201821, \u201822 and early \u201823. So positioning ourselves as a large buyer of all of these inputs and to some extent having to play hardball and getting some of that cost out, we put everybody in the company on clear directions around what our EBITDA per ton needs to be to get the kind of margins that drive the kind of returns on invested capital. And what that does for us is we need to be here and we have a gap. So everybody has a role to play in closing that gap and the cost takeout of inputs especially and I'm including distribution and logistics and things that are at levels that we've never seen before and stubbornly staying at those levels. Can't cover all of that just with higher prices and revenue because you run into all these other strategic issues like substitutions. So we've got to work on all of it. But that's really the approach is to take out some of the things that have found their way in and have become a bit structural but do it in a very analytical and organized way and then divide and conquer so we can close the gap. Much of what we've had success, you mentioned Build a Better IP. That is a very focused, formal, initiative, unique to IP initiatives. They're not dependent on the market per se, but a very focused process. We plan on using that same process to continue. We won't name it and we won't call it and we probably won't report on it, but what you should hopefully see as analysts and investors on the call is improved earnings quarter after quarter after quarter. We're going to use that same rigorous approach. We have some outside help in setting it up. We're running it entirely in-house now and we plan on continuing to do that to get the cost takeout. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Phil Ng : Well, first off, Mark, I want to thank you for all your great insights over the years and appreciate the leadership. So my first question is the company has always had a deep bench of senior executives that you've moved around nicely. What's the game plan in terms of the succession plan, thought process of internal versus external? And when the board is looking for the next candidate, any characteristics that stand out that they're looking for? Mark Sutton : It's a great question, Phil. When we put out the announcement to notify publicly that we were moving to the kind of last phase, we have a multi-phase process like most public companies do, and it's a multiyear process for leadership succession, and CEO, but also senior leader succession. The board is working very hard, obviously, on the board and working with them to make the best possible selection for the next leader of IP from both our internal talent, as you said, we have tremendous talent in the company. But again, good governance and a best practice is also to look at exhaustively at outside talent. And one thing just to remember on it, we're making progress, but the board is not looking to replace me. They're looking to find the next leader for IP for the future. And we think about what the future holds with respect to technology, with respect to what's happening in markets, the changing workforce. We built a specification about the future, the leader we think we need for the future of the company, and that's what the board is laser focused on. They're working hard on it. They're doing a great job with it. And we will get to a point where when we have something to report, we will, but I think the process we're using, high likelihood we come out with a great choice for the next leader for IP. But that's really the focus and how we're approaching it from the process standpoint. Phil Ng : Okay. That's great color. Year-to-date, you guys have taken about a million and a half tons of economic downtime with containerboard. Orange, I think, is about 800,000 tons of capacity. So when you take that capacity out, do you effectively reduce your economic downtime by half next year, assuming demands stable to growing and would that be additive to I guess the $140 million of savings you called out. I mean any color on the EBITDA impact I guess this year in the economic downtime would be helpful as well. Jay Royalty : Hey, Phil. This is Jay Royalty. Your math is good that's how the math works but we are in a transitional situation and I think you've heard both Tom and I talk about the improving demand trajectory so obviously with this move it still leaves us some flexibility, it still leaves us some room. We won't change anything about how we're operating to make the cost of that flexibility to minimize the cost of that flexibility but as we get our commercial analysis and we work very closely together on this in terms of the outlook. We're very comfortable that our commercial plans and our commercial execution of what we're doing, what Tom's doing in the box business and what we're doing in the containerboard business, that we need that flexibility and we need that capacity for how we see the future. So, that's where we are. Phil Ng : But Jay, am I interpreting correctly any improvement in economic downtime would be added to that $140 million in cost savings and any way to size up how much of the EBITDA impact it's been this year so far? Jay Royalty : The $140 million is the number that we've put out there in terms of the EBITDA impact, but yes, there would be further benefit from taking up that economic downtime or eliminating that economic downtime. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Matthew McKellar from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. It sounds like you're looking at opportunities to further optimize your cost structure in global cellulose fibers. Are you able to provide a bit more detail on what opportunities still exist there and whether you're maybe looking to either further capacity actions or capital investments that could drive stronger cost performance? And then when you think about what can drive you from your current run rate in that business to achieving above cost of capital returns, how do you think about the relative importance of optimizing that cost structure versus other factors like achieving more favorable production mix or driving stronger pricing? Thanks. Clay Ellis : Yes, thank you, Matthew. This is Clay. It's a great question. Part of the moves that we made with Pensacola and Riegelwood has a cost structure implication. Pensacola machine was a high cost machine. So that's part of it. We talked about Riegelwood, although it has fluff capacity over the past couple years the majority of that machine was used for not fluff, but for market pull, softwood market pulls. So that has a cost implication as well as a mix implication. So the benefits there are both in cost and in mix. If you think about going forward, what are the opportunities in the business? I think as we would, as I would prioritize our cost opportunities, it's first in supply chain with last year, 2022. A lot of things were put in place as we export 90% of our volume globally to get that volume out to serve our customers between warehousing and container freight stations and various methods. It increased our supply chain costs. We are unwinding those warehousing in different modes. Of course costs are coming down in freight rates, om ocean carrier rates. So that's very helpful, but also the things that we did uniquely that we can unwind uniquely. That's probably been a big driver, been a biggest driver and will continue to be a very big driver. We have more to optimize there. I think capacity, I think again, as we see the growth of fluff in the kind of historical ranges, we want to continue to -- we want to optimize our machines on fluff. I think mix is the biggest opportunity, as you mentioned, what is it cost, is it prices? Mix is an opportunity and then price are bigger opportunities then. We don't feel like we're disadvantaged in a cost of manufacturing or even a supply chain cost. So there's obviously benefit there, there's opportunity there, but mix and price would be, after we're optimizing this move, mix and prices is clearly the driver. Matthew McKellar : Great, that's helpful, thanks very much. If you're sticking with Pensacola, I think you also produce containerboard at that site. How does taking capacity down in the pulp side affect the cost profile of that mill, if at all? Thanks. Jay Royalty : Yes, so this is Jay Royalty. So there's clearly costs there that the containerboard business has to bear as a consequence of that move. Just putting a little perspective on how we think about Pensacola. Pensacola is a unique asset within our portfolio. It's globally competitive, lightweight, craft liner, really serving all the channels, both domestic export and as well as NAC. And if you think about the grade range that we have there, it goes from about 20 pounds to the mid-30s, so definitely differentiated from a lightweight standpoint. If you look at it on a traditional cost curve, it's right in the middle of the pack, but that's not on a per ton basis, it's not really the right way to look at a mill like Pensacola. You have to look at it on an area basis, which is the way boxes are made and sold. And Pensacola is a very capable machine. It's a live machine. It's a well-equipped machine. It's got significant output, about 550,000 tons, which is significant, in particular, when you consider that basis weight. And the capabilities at Pensacola, from our perspective, really match where the market is heading. Demand is high and growing for these wider weight products. And also in the context of being a single machine mill, we have other mills that are single machine mills that are competitive and successful, and we expect Pensacola to be no different in that regard. Matthew McKellar : Great. Thanks for that detail. And then last one for me, and you touched on this as part of your response to Anthony's question, but last quarter you showed a slide that indicated where your customer inventories were versus target levels broken down by customer segment. And it sounds like destocking is generally run its course, but if you're to run that same analysis today, do you think all customer segments would show inventories at or below target levels? Are there any segments, particularly within North America here, where destocking could still be a factor in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Tom Hamic : Great. Hey, Matthew, this is Tom Hammack. I think you're accurate in saying that destocking is generally over. We actually went out and talked to customers. We do that quarterly to get an idea of inventory levels. And the data came back exactly like we're saying is a dramatic shift over the last three quarters in terms of stock levels. In fact, in many cases, anecdotally, we're hearing people have oversteered a bit. And if you look at our order patterns in certain markets, it looks like that you're, we're seeing more rush orders, more volatility in orders, and so you can kind of picture them bouncing along the bottom. So we think in many cases it's more than healthy relative to future box demand. But all indications so far are exactly what you said. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Sutton for closing comments. Mark Sutton : Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for your time today and for your interest in International Paper. I look forward, along with the leadership team, to updating you on our progress on our next call at the end of January. So have a great rest of the day. Thank you. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's International Paper\u2019s Third quarter, 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3, where I will touch on our full year 2023 results. As I reflect on this past year, I'm very appreciative of all the hard work our employees have performed and for our strong customer relationships as we managed through a challenging market environment. Our teams across International Paper executed well, both commercially and operationally. They work closely with our customers to create value and serve their needs, while navigating an uncertain and changing demand environment. Our teams were also focused on driving our cost in all categories of spend across our large network of mills, box plants and supply chain operations. In addition, we took strategic actions to structurally reduce fixed costs in our mill system, in our Industrial Packaging business and our Global Cellulose Fibers business. We also made significant progress in Building a Better IP, by delivering $260 million of earnings benefits in 2023, driven by commercial and process improvement initiatives. I'm pleased to say that we've exceeded our target each year since we began this initiative, which demonstrates how Building a Better IP is now a mindset embedded in our culture, with intense focus on maximizing value through commercial and operational excellence. We also advanced our strategies to improve profitability across our portfolio. In our box business, our go-to-market strategy is focused on improving margins and mix by investing in capabilities to enhance our value proposition to align with customer needs. In Global Cellulose Fibers, our strategy is focused on optimizing the business, by reducing exposure to commodity pulp and aligning our mill footprint. We will be sharing more about these strategies later in the presentation. And in addition to reinvesting in our businesses, we also preserved our solid balance sheet and returned approximately $840 million to our shareholders. As we go through the rest of the presentation, we'll share our perspective on the market and the trends across our portfolio. We thought this would be helpful as you reflect on industry dynamics entering the new year. I will now turn it over to Tim who will provide more details. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Great. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone.  If we turn to Slide 4, the full year key financials. As Mark mentioned earlier, 2023 proved to be a challenging market environment, which impacted our financial performance. During much of the year, underlying demand for our products was lower, as consumers prioritize spending on services and essential goods. This trend was influenced by the pull forward of goods during the pandemic, as well as by inflationary pressures and rising interest rates that impacted the consumer. Demand for our products was further constrained by inventory destocking, as our customers and the broader supply chain work through elevated inventories of their products. The lower demand, combined with declining sales prices for our products and sticky cost inflation resulted in lower revenues and earnings in 2023, when compared to prior periods. Based on shipment trends across the markets we serve, we saw a demand trough in the first half of 2023, and then continued to see improvement throughout the year. In addition, we benefited from the Building a Better IP initiatives Mark just mentioned. And as a reminder, free cash flow for the year included a onetime use of cash totaling approximately $200 million, related to our timber monetization actions. Now I'll turn to the fourth quarter key financials on Slide 5. Operating earnings per share came in better than the outlook we provided in the third quarter. Our teams executed well, by optimizing costs and delivering commercial initiatives focused on margin and mix improvement. And as we announced in the third quarter, we closed our containerboard mill in Orange, Texas, and permanently idled 2 pulp machines in our mills in Riegelwood, North Carolina, and Pensacola, Florida. We expect the cost benefits from these closures to ramp throughout 2024. We are also encouraged to see that demand continue to recover across our portfolio in the fourth quarter, and we expect this trend to continue going forward. Now turning to Slide 6, I'll provide more details about the quarter as we walk through the sequential earnings bridge. Fourth quarter operating earnings per share was $0.41 as compared to $0.64 in the third quarter. Price and mix was lower by $0.18 per share, primarily due to index movements across our portfolio and lower export sales price. This was partially offset by margin and mix benefits from commercial initiatives in both businesses. Volume was favorable to earnings by $0.07 per share, as higher demand across our portfolio more than offset one less shipping day in our North American packaging business. We also had lower shipments of commodity pulp as we executed our strategy focused on improving mix and optimizing that business. Operations and cost was unfavorable by $0.12 per share sequentially. This is due to a nonrepeat of a favorable onetime item we called out in the third quarter related to lower cost of company paid benefits, totaling about $80 million or $0.18 per share. This nonrepeat was partially offset by our continued focus on reducing marginal cost and spending. We're accomplishing this by optimizing fiber and energy costs, reducing flavor overtime and corporate overhead expenses, driving down supply chain costs and shifting to lower-cost suppliers. We also had lower unabsorbed fixed costs related to less economic downtime as demand improved across our portfolio. Maintenance outages were higher by $13 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, and input costs were lower overall as increased pricing for OCC was offset by lower cost for energy, chemicals and wood. And finally, corporate items were impacted by a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. offsetting lower corporate expenses. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 7. Price and mix was lower due to index movements, lower export prices and higher export mix as demand improved. This was partially offset by benefits from commercial initiatives focused on margin improvement in our box business. Later in this presentation, Mark will talk more about this go-to-market strategy. Volume was higher despite one less shipping day in box. We saw sequentially higher daily shipments in our box business and higher volumes across our domestic and export containerboard channels. Operations and cost was unfavorable sequentially due to the nonrepeat items that I mentioned earlier, which benefited the third quarter in this business by $68 million. The majority of this was offset by lower economic downtime in the quarter as demand improved, and reflects the intense focus by our teams to reduce costs across our mills and box plants. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $22 million sequentially due to a seasonally lower outage schedule and our efforts to optimize outage spending across the mill system. Input costs were moderately lower primarily due to lower cost for energy and chemicals, partly offset by higher OCC costs. Turning to Slide 8. We thought it would be helpful to share some additional perspective on segment trends for our North American packaging business, based on feedback from our customers. As shown on the previous slide, our U.S. box shipments in the fourth quarter were up approximately 3% sequentially, and we've continued to see demand growth in packaging since the trough in the March of 2023. E-commerce has been very resilient, with our shipments in 2023, up approximately 30% since 2019. This continues to be an attractive channel for our consumers as evidenced during the past holiday season. International Paper has strategic customer relationships and a strong value proposition, with scale and geographic reach to support seasonal demand surges. Shipping and distribution was significantly affected by inventory destocking efforts across its longer supply chains. As a result, we've seen improvement across the segment since the destocking phase ran its course. Food and beverage has been relatively stable overall. The Fresh fruit -- fresh foods segment has benefited from solid performance across the food service channel and consumer shifts toward making home meals in place of processed food and its convenience. The protein segment has been impacted by supply reductions in beef and poultry. International Paper is overweight in this segment, which has impacted our box shipment performance relative to the overall industry. We believe this is temporary and expect trends to improve in 2024. The Beverage segment has been under pressure as budget-conscious consumers have reduced consumption of specialty beverages, which tend to be more packaging-intensive. On the other side of the spectrum, segments like durables and other nondurable consumer goods are more discretionary in nature and have been under pressure. Based on customer feedback and economic data like housing starts and consumer expectations, we expect demand in this packaging-intensive segment to improve. In summary, based on these trends, we believe industry box demand will grow approximately 3% in 2024. We understand the critical role corrugated packaging plays and bringing essential products to consumers, and we believe that IP is well positioned to grow with our customers over the long term. Turning to Slide 9. I'll touch on what we're seeing across our containerboard export channel. Demand for kraft containerboard continued to improve through the fourth quarter and based on feedback from our customers, inventories appear to have normalized across all regions. In terms of segment performance, we are seeing solid demand in fresh fruit and vegetable markets, where we have a strategic customer relationship in Latin America and the Mediterranean. Demand across the industrial segments in Europe and Asia remained soft due to the lower consumer demand for durables and nondurable products. We expect these segments to recover as the broader economy improves, and International Paper is well positioned to grow with these segments due to their performance requirements and need for heavyweight kraft linerboard. Moving on to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. We'll take a look at the fourth quarter. Price and mix was lower due to price index movements, partially offset by benefits from higher fluff and specialty pulp mix. Volume was relatively flat overall, as higher demand for fluff and specialty pulp was offset by lower sales of commodity grades as we continue to focus on strategically aligning our business with the most attractive customers and segments. Operations and cost was unfavorable sequentially due to the nonrepeat item I mentioned earlier, which benefited the third quarter in this business by $12 million. In addition, ops and costs included a planned turbine maintenance expense of $18 million. Planned maintenance outages were also higher in the fourth quarter by $35 million. And finally, input costs were lower by $7 million, primarily due to lower wood and chemical costs. Turning to Slide 11. I'll talk about what we're seeing across the fluff pulp segment. Overall demand has continued to improve through the fourth quarter, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Inventories have normalized across much of our customer base. We are seeing most of the improvement to date from the developed economies driven by improving consumer demand, stabilizing inflation and more stable currencies. Demand in China and the Middle East has been stable, and we expect a normal seasonal decline in those regions in the first quarter due to Chinese New Year and Ramadan. Inventories are elevated, however, we expect them to normalize in the second quarter. On Slide 12, I'll share a few comments about 2024. Given the fluid market environment, we have chosen not to provide a full year earnings outlook. However, we will share our view of demand trends and IP improvement initiatives as well as other financial assumptions. Overall, we believe the demand environment will continue to improve across our portfolio, and we have initiatives focused on improving mix and margins in both businesses. We expect the first quarter of 2024 will be an earnings trough due to seasonally low volumes, seasonally higher costs and unfavorable impacts from the January winter freeze. Also, the majority of prior publication declines will flow through the first quarter. Regarding demand trends, we expect packaging and fluff pulp markets to grow approximately 3% year-over-year. In 2024, our North American box business may trail the market as we continue to execute a go-to-market strategy focused on margin and mix improvement. Given International Paper's commercial and operational initiatives, we expect more than $400 million of benefits this year. These initiatives should ramp up through the year and include cost reduction benefits from the closure of our containerboard mill in Orange, Texas, and 2 pulp machine closures at our mills in Riegelwood, North Carolina, and Pensacola, Florida. We also expect higher costs for OCC as demand continues to improve and general inflation on things like transportation, wages, employee benefits, materials and services. We plan to invest between $800 million and $1 billion in capital investments for general maintenance, cost improvement and enhanced capabilities in our box business. Other assumptions for items like corporate expense, interest expense and tax rate are included on Slide 30 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 13. I'll outline our first quarter outlook. Before I get into the details on each of the businesses, the January winter freeze is expected to negatively impact earnings for the first quarter by approximately $40 million for the company. This impact is embedded in the numbers I will provide for each business. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to remain flat overall. The prior index movement in North America is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $67 million. However, we expect this to be offset by approximately $68 million of commercial benefits from contract restructuring in our North American box business. This is part of our box go-to-market strategy that Mark will discuss in a few minutes. Volume is expected to decrease earnings by $25 million due to seasonally lower daily demand, partially offset by 2 more shipping days. Operations and costs is expected to decrease earnings by $30 million. This is due to seasonality and some cost inflation on wages and employee benefits. These increases should be partially offset by lower fixed costs resulting from the closure of our Orange mill. Higher maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease earnings by $31 million. And lastly, rising input costs are expected to decrease earnings by $20 million, driven by higher OCC and seasonally higher energy costs. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers. We expect price and mix to increase earnings by $5 million as a result of our strategy to reduce exposure to commodity pulp. Overall volume is expected to remain stable, as seasonally lower shipments during the Chinese New Year are being offset by improved demand in other regions. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $5 million due to seasonality and cost inflation. This is partially offset by the non-repeat of the turbine maintenance outage in the fourth quarter, and lower fixed costs resulting from the idling of our pulp machine in our Riegelwood mill. As you may recall, the machine in our Pensacola mill was already idled in the third quarter. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $16 million. And lastly, higher input costs are expected to decrease earnings by $5 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. I'm going to turn to Slide 14, and I'll talk about our go-to-market strategy in our North American box business. During our last earnings call, I highlighted strategic investments we were making across our box system to create value, by improving our capabilities to serve customer needs and improve productivity. This includes adding new converting lines in existing plants, upgrading older equipment with newer, more advanced technology and new plants like the one we opened in Eastern Pennsylvania. These investments are helping us address capacity constraints in certain regions, and also address productivity related to the tight labor markets and a less experienced workforce on average. Our box go-to-market strategy is about leveraging our capabilities and strong segment-based value propositions to improve margins and mix. It's about making choices that create value for our customers while maximizing the profitability of our packaging business. Earlier, Tim called out approximately $68 million of earnings benefits expected in the first quarter as a result of this strategy in action. So we're making the changes that will progress through 2024, as we continue to reset the business and strengthen our position for the future. We are focusing on value over volume. Therefore, we may trail the industry for the next few quarters when measuring unit volume growth, but we expect to grow at or above market thereafter, and we expect our earnings to improve through this process. In summary, we have significant opportunities to leverage our strong value proposition to serve customer needs, improve our mix and capture additional value. Turning to Slide 15, I'll update you on our strategy for Global Cellulose Fibers. First, let me say that I'm not satisfied with the absolute level of earnings that the business has produced. But as I've said before, I believe there is a good business within this business. And I also believe we can improve earnings and cash flows over the cycle by aligning with those customers and segments who value our differentiated product and service offerings. We believe fluff is a value-added product that will grow over time, because of the essential role that absorbent personal care products play in meeting consumer needs. At International Paper, we have talented teams with significant market expertise and a mill system with a broad set of capabilities. This allows us to create value for our customers, by delivering innovation and products that meet their most stringent performance and product safety standards. To improve the financial performance of this business, our commercial teams have been focused on getting paid for value that we provide and being more selective in the segments that we actually serve. As a result, we have earned a higher premium for fluff grades relative to commodity pulp grades by capturing more value. We're also improving our mix by reducing our exposure to commodity grades and by serving the most attractive customers that allow us to maximize the value of this business. Our exposure to commodity grades will mostly consist of our bleached softwood, northern bleached softwood kraft mill that goes really into tissue products and is produced at our low-cost Grand Prairie mill that is strategically located near that fiber source in Canada. Aligned with this optimization strategy, we took actions to rightsize our footprint and reduce fixed costs across our mill system which we estimate will improve EBITDA for Global Cellulose Fibers by approximately $90 million per year. Our teams are also focused on driving out costs across our supply chain by leveraging new tools and data analytics. So in summary, we're pulling a lot of levers in this business and expect to make meaningful progress towards our strategy in 2024. Turning to Slide 16. I'll share some examples of how we are deploying technologies across the company in our manufacturing, converting and supply chain operations. Over the past couple of years, we've developed and piloted new tools and capabilities to reduce costs, increase productivity and improve efficiencies. All of this will result in a better experience in terms of reliably providing products and services for our customers. By leveraging these new tools, we're seeing benefits in areas such as improved reliability and lower maintenance cost higher yields on fiber, energy and chemical usage, more optimized machine scheduling at our mills and box plants, better logistics planning across our supply chain and more sourcing opportunities for operating and repair materials due to better visibility and consolidated purchases. These new technologies also enable more collaboration by connecting teams at our facilities to enterprise specialists, allowing us to maximize the opportunities. We believe there are more opportunities going forward, and this is a great example of how Building a Better IP is embedded into our culture. On Slide 17, I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions. As I said in the past, we have a solid balance sheet, which we will preserve because we believe it is core to our capital allocation framework. Our 2023 year-end leverage was at 2.5x on a Moody's basis, which is at the low end of our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. Looking ahead, we have limited short and medium-term debt maturities due to the risk mitigation strategies we've taken over the past several years, and we expect our qualified pension plan to remain fully funded. Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. And last year, we returned approximately $840 million to our shareholders, and we remain committed to our dividend. We understand investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. And as I shared with you previously, we have opportunities to invest in our box system to build out capabilities and position us for future profitable growth. We also have cost reduction projects across the company with attractive returns. So turning to Slide 18. I'd like to wrap up by sharing my view that International Paper is well positioned for the future. I shared that conviction before, but after navigating another year of challenging market conditions, it bears repeating. Our financial foundation is strong, as are the principles and core values that guide our actions and decisions about how we operate, I'm confident that the winning mindset of our leadership team and our employees, and the agility of our employees will drive our success as we tackle our improvement efforts and execute the go-to-market strategy we talked about in today's call. As we move through 2024, we anticipate continued demand recovery across the markets we serve, along with margin and mix improvement from our commercial strategies. There's no question in my mind that we are on the right path. Given our strategic customer relationships, talented teams, world-class assets and market expertise, we are committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our stakeholders, and we intend to deliver. With that, we're happy to take your questions. And similar to the last quarter, our senior business leaders are joining me today to provide their perspectives in the Q&A section. So operator, we are ready to go to a question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Philip Ng : I appreciate all the great color on some of these commercial initiatives on getting value over volumes, Mark. That's great. Is much of this pretty much locked up contractually, so that's it's just flowing through. And then can you just expand a little bit on what you're exactly doing? You effectively just walk away from lower margin business and mixing up? And then just lastly, I think you guys guided to like a $68 million tailwind for 1Q. Do we just kind of annualize that impact for the full year? Mark Sutton : No, good 3-part question, Phil, and thank you for that. I'm going to have Tom Hamic, who's leading that strategy from the front. It's a 4-pillar strategy to improve the business, and it's much more than just walking away from this, we don't want to walk away from any of our good customers, but a lot changed over the last couple of years relative to inflation and really the attractiveness of certain segments. So Tom and his team are really putting together a thoughtful strategy reboot, if you will, on how we go to market segments and customers. And the goal is for it to work for our customers and for us, but for International Paper to improve profitability. So Tom, if you -- can you maybe just share a bit about how we're approaching the go-to-market strategy. William Hamic : This is Tom Hamic. I would agree with what Mark said, this is really a holistic strategy for the business. So this includes everything from where we invest capital to the metrics we use to really run the business. So customers pay for value, but value in the box business starts with reliability, with quality and with shipping on time. And so we have refocused our efforts in that space. Obviously, going through the pandemic that can make that more difficult. But as we come out, we feel very positive about the metrics we're seeing in terms of improving the customer experience. We improved the customer experience, we deliver more value, and then we charge for that value. And you're right, there will be times when customers have a disagreement about what their price is. There are -- most times, the vast majority of times, that's really not been the case. They've seen the value of IP. And in some cases, customers have left and then come back very quickly because box making is difficult and their service model is often very challenging. So that's really the equation, provide more value, make customers know that you are important to their business and then get paid fairly for it. And that really sums up the strategy. Philip Ng : And are these wins pretty much locked in? And then you gave some color in terms of the contribution for 1Q. Can we kind of annualize that for a full year in terms of what that upside on the commercial initiatives that you have? William Hamic : Yes. I think annualizing it would be -- that's fair. There's -- every customer has a different relationship. There's different timing of contracts. I am completely confident that, that number is solid and that we'll maintain that margin structure going forward, and I expect to improve it going forward in 2024. Philip Ng : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciating there's a lot of moving pieces in 2024, both on the macro front. And then certainly, there's a price increase you guys are all trying to implement in January. But any color, just at least directionally when we think about EBITDA and free cash flow based on the control -- your controllables and how you see demand unfolding. Do you expect EBITDA, free cash flow the flat or down? Just directional color would be super helpful. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Phil, it's Tim. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're choosing not to give an outlook. It's just -- there are a lot of moving pieces. We feel good about the year. We feel like we're in a good place in terms of earnings and cash flow but we're not quantifying it or putting something out. We can look at it next quarter and maybe we'll make an adjustment. But for the moment, we're focused on the first quarter outlook, and we'll go from there. Philip Ng : Okay. In regards to that first quarter hangover from the January freeze, do you expect any hangover effect on to 2Q, like these costs lingering or any disruption? Or is this kind of a 1Q thing, and you guys are largely done? Timothy Nicholls : Phil, I believe it's 1Q and we're done. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland from Truist Securities. Michael Roxland : I just wanted to follow up on the focus on value over volume. Can you talk about some of the issues you noticed in your customer contracts to sort of encourage you to revisit how you price? And could this focus on value over volume involve some -- maybe some additional portfolio rightsizing or maybe even distancing yourself on the publication if that publication does not actually properly reflect pricing that you're seeing in the market? Mark Sutton : So Mike, Tom is going to really tackle this question. But just to be totally clear, we expect long term, the business earnings growth is going to come from unit volume growth and margin improvement on that unit volume. What we're doing right now and what Tom has described is, in the interim of resetting with this level of once-in-a-lifetime inflation and the number of other structural changes, we will pit value over volume, and then we're going to pick value and volume or profitability and volume. So unit volume is very important in this business. It's not a high-growth market, but you have to grow with the market long term, and we plan to do that. And so Tom, if you want to talk a little bit about some of the things we've seen or how we think about it. We can circle back on the question about the index and how prices are changed in this market. William Hamic : Sure. Mike, I would say that we see everything in contracts. There are contracts that don't tie the index, there are contracts that do. So it's really hard to draw out a specific, this is what we're seeing that's an issue. The biggest issue is that when the contract comes up, are we clear in articulating value? Is that fair proposal because we don't expect contracts to go our way. We don't expect them to go to the customer's way. We expect a middle and fair ground, and part of that is just getting the economics of the contract within range and making sure that the customer expectation for pricing is very similar to what you have, so there are no surprises. So I would say it's not one tie sets at all. But the really core component of this, and Mark mentioned growing with market is, a very clear local understanding of what's happening in the box business because unlike linerboard and pulp, the box business is very local, and those decisions have to be very targeted around value propositions and around customer growth in that market. And I think that's what's going to have us turn the corner in a few quarters to get back to growing market. And the last thing I would say is that we're not seeing customers leave. We've certainly picked up some business, but you're really talking about some marginal volume in local places where maybe the match isn't perfect long term. Maybe it's better for both parties to readjust and get to the right value equation. Michael Roxland : Got it. And just, I guess, one quick follow-up in terms of your strategy on GCF and really trying to enhance the mix. Do you see -- in terms of the portfolio itself, obviously, post-Riegelwood, post-Pensacola, are there other opportunities for you to rightsize your portfolio there? If -- basically, if demand is not materializing as you would expect? Clay Ellis : Yes, Mike, this is Clay Ellis. Yes, I think as you mentioned, the mitigating the exposure that we have to commodity or paper-grade pulp at the Riegelwood mill. If you look at 2024, post the closure of Riegelwood 20, we still have some exposure. We're not at our optimized mix, although we're much further along the way toward that. But we believe fluff will grow, and that will -- obviously, we'll move SBSK or paper grade to fluff. So we think exiting '24 and to '25, we'll be getting pretty close to our optimized mix. There will always be a small amount of the paper-grade pulp in the mix. And we -- but we think we'll be getting to really our optimized mix here exiting '24 and to '25. So we'll have an improvement through, all through '24. Of course, we have levers if fluff pulp did not grow and such, there are things that we have as options. But that's not really what we believe or what -- we think absorbent hygiene products will grow. And therefore, we think that fluff will grow. We're excited about the trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Maybe first of all, I'm going to follow up on Phil's question, and I realize you may or may not say anything on this, but it's probably the question investors are thinking about most. So I'll give it a shot. And that is understanding there's a lot of variability on how pricing can play out, and that can have a very large impact on where numbers ultimately end up in '24. You did provide us with an assessment on your volume. You've talked about a lot of the different internal initiatives, et cetera. Is it possible that, as you did last year, you could give us a range if we exclude impact from any price changes not yet reflected in the trade publications? Timothy Nicholls : Mark, it's Tim. We could -- I mean we can look at that, but we did think about it carefully entering to this call. And just given the size and the fluidity and all of those factors, we just chose not to do it at this moment. So like I said a minute ago, we can look at it quarter-by-quarter and see if it makes sense. But for this quarter, we chose not to. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Fair enough. And then just maybe on this -- the shipping businesses getting paid for value, a process you've been doing for a long time. Where are you would you say with your customers? Is the vast majority now where you think it should be? How much more of these negotiations is there yet to go? And just for context, if we go back several years, there's been a relatively continual decline in your market share on the box volume business. So what's -- is there anything added you can provide to us to feel like, okay, yes, we do have visibility on when this can turn the corner? William Hamic : Sure I would portray it as we're pretty confident that we're going to come back to market. And I think there are 2 things driving that. One is we've got a strategic view of the customer base. We understand who's growing, who's not growing. We understand the value equation. I think, much better than we have in the past. We've worked very hard in understanding that. But I think the key is investing behind the growth. So as we change the portfolio, we're investing very quickly in a targeted way. And so I think that positions us probably better than in the past in terms of having the right capacity and the right markets to grow with the customers. And so if you want to look back and say, how could we have approved, is there's not a national strategy as much as there's a national and a local strategy for investment, and I think that positions us well to grow. Mark Weintraub : So maybe just to follow on that. So basically, you have now the investments whereas before maybe they hadn't been made, in terms of being able to deliver what it needs to be in the last couple of years, you've made those investments so now are in a different place. Is that why the outcome should be expected to be different? And then maybe if you could just following up on the -- what percentage of contracts or volume? Do you think it's now been repositioned versus is still in process? William Hamic : Yes, that's a tough one to answer in terms of percentage. I would certainly say it's more than 1/4 has not been renegotiated, probably a little more than 1/3, but the hard thing about that is every -- in many cases, local customers, that's a constant discussion around value and what products they're buying. So that's 35% of our mix. I would say that never goes away. That's a constant. So I'm really talking about the 65% that's left over. There's still a good portion out there that we'll have to come to a value equation with the customers. Mark Sutton : And Mark, just to add to the area you were probing on market position and share. Part of the way we addressed some of the demand environment in the past was in different regions, and Tom mentioned it, it really matters in the region, not on average. In different regions, we had the assets. We just didn't have the plants running more than 5 days a week. So we asked employees to run a 6-day, and in most cases, they really enjoyed that. They didn't mind doing it and it was increased income and all that. And then if you get enough to where it's sustainable, maybe you add an entire shift, and then you invest in new plant equipment because if there -- you already have the capacity, you just need people to run it. And we did that for quite a while. What changed a bit, though, during the 2021, '22 period, and the workforce started to turn over, that's not a great assumption anymore that you can tackle that incremental growth with your assets by adding people or asking the people you have to work a little more hours. And so that's just the reality of the manufacturing workforce out there for us. So if I had to do over, I wish I would have spent much more in physical plant equipment in '18, '19 and '20, we were finishing some mill investments with an eye toward getting into plant equipment investments in a big way in the box business, and we got caught a bit there with a change in the workforce. So we're working both on getting our new labor up to speed and putting physically new equipment and upgrading the old equipment, some of the legacy IP box plants that were pre -- the big acquisitions we made are really old and some of the equipment is still running, but it may be running at 80% of its design capacity. So all of that is part of being able to address the market by region, by kind of metropolitan market. And so that's why I feel good about our ability to do this. We hadn't made all of those physical investments in the past. We did it with our employee teams working different schedules, and it worked for a while. It's not the sustainable way to do it now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew McKellar from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : First, to follow up on one of Mike Roxland's questions. Is your NBSK mill and Grand Prairie core for IP over the longer term, given your greater focus on fluff? Clay Ellis : Matthew, this is Clay Ellis. I think our NBSK mill is a strategic mill. We do have a very strong customer base on that mill. Obviously, it goes into tissue, but we also have a lot of both fluff customers and NBSK customers being the same. So it creates a bundled value there. And so it's a good -- it's a very good mill, as Mark mentioned in the comments. We like it. It provides value. It is not in our core of fluff, but we think of it differently being NBSK in that market and the contract relationships that we have, we think of it a bit differently than more of the commodity SBSK. So it's a good mill, but we like it. It's not absolutely core to what we do, but it provides value. Matthew McKellar : Great. Just one more for me. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your process to identify a successor for the CEO position and what we should be expecting in terms of a time line there? Mark Sutton : Good question, Matt. Nothing new to report. Our Board is working very deliberately on the process that we announced, that we would undergo back in September. And I can say we're closer to a decision now than we were in September, but there's no time line to report, but we are making really good progress and our Boards putting a lot of effort into it. It's obviously an important decision, and they're taking it very, very seriously. So as we get closer and we have something tangible to report, we will be out with that information. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Gabrial Hajde : I'm going to try to take one more stab because I feel like I need to wash myself of the past 10 years of knowledge that I feel like I've acquired. What we heard from one of your peers as well as yourself is that maybe you're trying to decouple yourselves from index-based pricing. And if, in fact, that is the case, maybe the outlook that you gave us for Q1 and the $68 million of positive benefit that you're talking about, maybe that's associated with renegotiating maybe half of those national contracts that I think Tom Hamic referenced. And if, in fact, that is the case or maybe pass differently, if the price that's being pushed in the marketplace right now has been reflected on the January 19 publication, would that, in any way, change the guidance that you're giving us today for Q1? Mark Sutton : So Gabe, it's a valiant try. Let me just see if this helps you and the other analysts and our investors. So our pricing, as always, the prices we charge and the mechanisms we use are really between IP and our customers. And we're not going to comment on those specifics or provide forecasting on pricing for the future. As you know, we never do that. But I will refer you to the Citibank conference that I spoke at publicly in November. I -- in response to a question about a $20 publication down at that time, I stated that we didn't feel that it was reflective of our experience with our customers. And in terms of the experience over the last 2 months, with our containerboard customers. The fact that the index stayed flat in January, again, is not reflective of the pricing we have been invoicing. So if you get to your question about the relevancy of the index, it's true. The index is serving what is increasingly a very small open market. And because of that, it feels like there's a movement of some subjectivity in that process in addition to what's actually happening. So based on what we've been charging our customers as well as other public data, we don't feel the index over the last few quarters, a couple of quarters has been reflective of what's really happening in the industry. And as I said at Citi, we use this index. It's not perfect, but it works for the supplier, IT and it works for our customers, because corrugated packaging is not something our customers want to work on weekly or monthly with pricing. It's really important to their business, but it's not their core product. It's running on high-speed finishing lines, and it needs to work, and they don't want to deal with economics. This index through history has worked as a starting point for discussions up or down. It doesn't set the price, as you know. So we will continue to evaluate, and we are evaluating with our customers, is it's still working for us or not, as 2 parties in a business relationship. And if we conclude it's not, we will work on doing it a different way. And that's probably all I can say about that at this point. Gabrial Hajde : No, Mark, listen, I think that was very clear and helpful at least for me. Secondarily, the $400 million that you mentioned in terms of -- I don't know if it was newly-identified cost savings, maybe a second turn of the crank on Building a Better IP. And then I think the $240 million or so of fixed cost savings from the 2 or 3 machine closures. Can you maybe delineate between the legacy build and better IP, I think the net of that was plus $540 million. And then we've got the $230 million or $240 million from the 2 plant closures, where does this $400 million number that you referenced? How does that fit into the equation? Just so we're not double or triple counting. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. No, good question. This is Tim. I mean if you just look at the major items that I called out in my prepared remarks around the go-to-market strategy, and how that's playing out. And then the mill closure is to fixed cost savings. I think you get pretty close to the $400 million. There's obviously other initiatives. That's why we say more than $400 million. We've got any number of initiatives across all of our businesses and at the center. But we thought it was a good reference point given the significant items that are happening and happened late last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about January box shipment trends and specifically on the freeze, did that delay shipments or destroy shipments? And if there's any kind of quantification there either way? And just anything you'd say about sort of customer inventories and your inventories as we start out February? William Hamic : Sure, Anthony, this is Tom. You point out the winter storm, but that is a very big impact on January. So I'll start with the quarter. And we see continued improvement in the quarter in terms of demand if you subtract out our experience with go-to-market, we think the market is going to grow about 2% year-over-year in the first quarter. So that's a continued momentum that Tim talked about, and we're very pleased with that growth. In terms of January, it really does mask exactly what's happening. The thing I can confidently say to you is, nothing about the winter storm and the subsequent business activity would suggest we're off of forecast for Q1. It's just really hard to look through this way, we had plant closures, customers have plant closures. And then the last thing I would add is the anecdotal feedback from our especially local customers has been surprisingly positive about the first half of the year. We'll see how it plays out, but so far, very good. Last piece, you asked about inventory, I'm sorry -- I -- we have not -- sorry... Anthony Pettinari : No, no, go ahead, please. William Hamic : We have not seen restocking yet broadly. That's our estimate of what's happening in the marketplace. And so we think destocking is obviously over or there are certain segments that may be bouncing back and forth. But if you look at last year's demand for boxes and you take what is always a pretty good reference for consumer spending, retail spending and box demand, there's still a lot of ground to be made up. And so I feel very good about the inventory levels in the market. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then I'm just curious, on the go-to-market initiatives, have you changed anything around incentive structures, how the sales force is compensated or how box plant managers are compensated. It sounds like there's sort of an asset under investment problem that maybe you'll turn the corner on this year. I'm just wondering if there's been a real change in incentives and understanding it's maybe difficult to talk about that in too much detail on the call. But just wondering if that's a significant component of the go-to-market initiative? William Hamic : It is a significant component. Some hard to talk about, but I think some pretty easy, which is from a soft incentive standpoint, does everyone understand the strategy? Do they understand the metrics that we're going to focus on? Like, I talked about service and profitability and capital effectiveness. That's very much underway. And I would say, in many cases, complete. You are correct. We've changed the sales compensation. And so far, any time you change compensation processes, you can always have a little bit of noise so far. It is exceeded our expectations, and I think exceeded the expectations of the people in the field. So I feel very good about that. But you bring up a very good point. Executing the strategy is not in a silo. It's across the business. Everything has to be aligned. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next, we'll go to the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : My remaining question I just wanted to piggyback on what Anthony was getting at. So obviously, there's capacity, there's capabilities, there's technology, but do you not only need to address, as you discussed, incentives with sales, but do you need to maybe add more people, more feet on the street in terms of executing what you hope to do and go to market with box and corrugated or not? And what would be the reasons why? The related question, again, I'll stick to 2, and just being mindful of the time. When you look at your end markets and your customers historically, IP has been with larger account and national account businesses. Do you think those customers because they're more sophisticated potentially, will be more able to understand the KPIs and the whole process that IP is now bringing in terms of this go-to-market or you think that will be perhaps across your end markets a little bit more challenging relative to your local account business, and how you see your end markets over time evolving with a new go-to-market where you get larger with local account or larger with larger accounts? William Hamic : Good question. I'll see if I can address it. So I would start with a number of salespeople. You're absolutely correct. We need a significant number of new salespeople. We're making progress in that space. And I can tell you the compensation plan has made our positions much more attractive than it has been in the past. So we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the local versus national, I think it would be -- it kind of gets back to my local versus national company in terms of box plants that it really depends on the customer. We're going to have some customers that are professional buyers and they're going to look at these metrics one way and local customers. I would say this, that we expect to grow higher-margin local customers. And we expect to keep and grow our national customers. Our leaning is more of a balance and not to run too hard in one direction, but to really evaluate the profit equation as we make those decisions. So you'll see some rebalancing. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Nellessen for closing comments. Mark Sutton : This is Mark Sutton. Thank you, operator. I'll go ahead and wrap up. I want to thank everyone for your time today, for your continued interest in International Paper, and we look forward to updating you on our progress our next call at the end of the first quarter, we're already in the second quarter -- for the end of the first quarter call. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's International Paper's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's First Quarter Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  There's important information at the beginning of our presentation, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains certain copies of the first quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides.  I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 4 where I will highlight our results.  Starting off the year, our teams across International Paper executed well with intense focus on taking care of our customers while accelerating commercial and mill optimization strategies. We are also encouraged to see positive market momentum as we continue to see signs of demand recovery. Additionally, sales price index has improved across our portfolio and the majority of this will flow through our contracts in future quarters. Our first quarter were generally in line with our outlook and represent a trough based on seasonally low volumes, higher OCC costs and the majority impact from the 2023 sales price index declines.  Earnings were also on impacted by approximately $38 million from the January winter freeze and approximately $14 million from a significant fire that consumed our box plant in Ixtac, Mexico. Fortunately, no one was injured and our team to remain focused on taking care of our employees and customers as we manage through this incident. Also In the quarter, our teams across International Paper made significant progress executing our strategic initiatives.  We realized significant margin and mix benefits from our Box Go-to-Market strategy, well above our initial expectations for the first quarter. In addition, we continue to make investments to strengthen our packaging businesses. We also realized benefits from our optimization strategy in Global Cellulose Fibers and from the fixed cost reduction initiatives in our mill system. These strategic initiatives across our portfolio are focused on accelerating margin improvement and driving profitable growth.  In addition to this ongoing work, last week, we announced a catalyst to create significant value for shareholders through a highly compelling combination with DS Smith. This additional catalyst is something we look forward to working along with DS Smith team and continuing our conversations with investors regarding this opportunity. At this time, we do not have any additional information to share. So for today's call, including the Q&A session, we intend to focus specifically on International Paper's performance. I will now turn it over to Tim who will provide more details about our first quarter performance and also our outlook. Tim? Timothy Nicholls : Great. Thank you, Mark. Turning to our first quarter key financials on Slide 5. As Mark mentioned earlier, our first quarter earnings were generally in line with our outlook and represent a trough based on seasonally low volumes, higher OCC costs and the majority impact from the 2023 sales price index declines. Operating earnings and margins were also negatively impacted by approximately $52 million or $0.10 per share from the January winter freeze and the Ixtac box plant fire.  For the quarter, we generated $144 million of free cash flow. As a reminder, our free cash flow in the first quarter of last year included a $193 million final settlement with the IRS related to IP's timber monetization structure. Looking ahead, we expect significant earnings improvement based on positive market trends and benefits from our commercial and cost improvement initiatives.  Now I'll turn to Slide 6, and I'll provide more details about the quarter as we walk through the sequential earnings bridge. First quarter operating earnings per share was $0.17 as compared to $0.41 in quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the first quarter included $0.10 per share related to the January freeze and the Ixtac fire. Price and mix was higher by $0.14 per share, driven by significant margin and mix benefits from successfully executing our Box Go-to-Market strategy and our GCF optimization strategy. This was partially offset by the majority of prior sales price index declines from 2023.  Volume was unfavorable by $0.08 per share primarily due to seasonally lower shipments across both segments as well as some impact from the winter storm in January. We continue to deploy our commercial strategies across the portfolio, focused on margin and mix improvement which has impacted volumes in the near term as we transition based on our strategy. Operations and costs were unfavorable by $0.13 per share sequentially. This included approximately $0.07 per share from the January winter freeze and the Ixtac box plant fire. The remainder was primarily due to cost inflation including the higher cost of employee benefits.  The unfavorable impact to operating costs from seasonally lower volumes was offset by cost savings from our mill closure and machine shutdowns last year. Maintenance outages were higher by $16 million or $0.03 per in the first quarter. And input cost unfavorably impacted earnings by $0.07 per share sequentially, largely due to increased costs for OCC, with the remainder from higher energy and chemicals. And finally, corporate items unfavorably impacted earnings by $0.07 per share sequentially, primarily due to FX and reserve adjustments that were favorable in the fourth quarter. Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 7. Price and mix was higher due to significant benefit from our Box Go-to-Market strategy, which contributed approximately $110 million of earnings benefit from improved margins and mix. This was partially offset by the majority of prior sales price index declines on 2023, which negatively impacted earnings by approximately $53 million. With that said, the February index publication of $40 per ton increase will flow through our contracts primarily over the next couple of quarters. In addition, the commercial benefits from our Box Go-to-Market strategy exceeded our expectations for the first quarter and the commercial teams remain focused on pursuing additional opportunities going forward. Volume was lower as first quarter represents our seasonally lowest shipment quarter of the year and was also adversely impacted by the January freeze. Also, our Box Go-to-Market strategy is about making choices that will likely impact our volume in the near term, but will allow us to improve our margins and mix the long term. Although we expect to trail the industry for the next few quarters when measuring unit volume growth, we fully expect the volume impact to be tempered as we continue to transition toward our target mix of customers and invest in the business to maximize profitability.  Operations and costs included a $34 million unfavorable impact from the January winter freeze and the Ixtac box plant fire in March. The remainder was primarily due to cost inflation, including items such as labor, materials, contracted maintenance services and higher cost of employee benefits. There was also lower fixed cost absorption from seasonally lower volumes. However, this was partially offset by $22 million of fixed cost savings from the Orange mill closure. Outside of the January freeze our mill system ran very well in the first quarter. Planned maintenance outages were higher by $26 million sequential and input costs were higher primarily due to higher OCC costs.  On Slide 8, we thought it would be helpful to update you on segment trends for our North American packaging business like we did last quarter. We continue to see stable to improving demand across all end-use segments. Let me highlight some of the trends based on customer feedback. E-commerce continues to be very resilient, up mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis in quarter and significantly above pre-COVID levels.  Food and beverage has been relatively stable overall. The overall Fresh Food segment continues to benefit from solid performance across the foodservice channel as well as consumer shifts toward make at-home mills in lieu of Processed Food and its convenience. The Processed Food segment is beginning to show signs of improvement as some and retailers are running promotions to improve sales volumes. The produce segment was about flat in the first quarter with a drag from wet weather in the Western U.S. However, this segment is expected to recover in the second quarter.  And the Protein segment is improving following a period of supply reductions in beef and poultry. Poultry remains a preferred choice by consumers based on value. The beverage segment remains under pressure as budget-conscious consumers have reduced consumption of specialty beverages and bottled beer, which tend to be more packaging intensive.  In summary, based on these trends, we believe industry box demand will grow approximately 2% to 3% in 2024. We understand the critical role of corrugated packaging plays and bringing essential products to consumers, and we believe that IP is well positioned to grow our customers -- with our customers over the long term.  Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 9. Price and mix was higher due to price index movement and the GCF optimization strategy driving benefits from higher absorbent pulp mix and the reduction of commodity grades. Volumes sequentially was relatively flat overall as improved demand for absorbent pulp was offset by lower sales of commodity grades as we continue to focus on strategic aligning our business with the most attractive customers and segments. Operations and cost was unfavorable sequentially due to the January freeze and cost inflation, including labor, materials, contracted services and higher cost of employee benefits and some timing of spend. Most of this was offset by $12 million of lower fixed costs resulting from the 2 pulp machine closures at our Mills in Riegelwood, North Carolina and Pensacola, Florida. Planned maintenance outages were lower in quarter by $10 million and also included a $24 million outage related to the Georgetown's white papers machine that unfavorably impacted earnings in the first quarter, but is expected to be recovered throughout the year through an existing supply agreement with Sylvamo. Finally, input costs were higher by $7 million, primarily due to higher energy costs during the January 3. On Slide 10, we'll take a look at our second quarter outlook. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve earnings by $65 million sequentially. This is the result of the prior index movement in North America, higher export prices to date as well as continued progress with our Box Go-to-Market strategy. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $55 million, primarily due to seasonally higher daily with 1 more shipping day. Operations and cost is expected to decrease earnings by $70 million. This includes proactive maintenance spending beyond our full-scale mill annual outage program. As we anticipate continued demand recovery and increased equipment utilization, this spending is focused on improving productivity and efficiencies across our mills and box plant network. We will continue to experience additional inflation and higher S&A including additional commercial resources to support our Box Go-to-Market strategy.  Higher maintenance outage expenses expected to decrease earnings by $4 million. Included in that total is a $19 million outage related to the Riverdale white papers machine that will be recovered throughout the year through an existing supply agreement with Sylvamo. And lastly, input costs are expected to be stable overall as higher OCC costs are expected to be offset by lower energy costs.  Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase earnings by $15 million as a result of prior index movements. Volume is expected to remain flat as we reduce exposure to commodity grades and grow with absorbent pulp. Operations and costs are expected to increase earnings by $20 million, primarily due to lower fixed costs resulting from pulp machine closures in our Riegelwood and Pensacola mills, the nonrepeat of the January [ freight ] and time of spending. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings in the second quarter by $19 million. This sequential improvement reflects the $24 million Georgetown paper outage that occurred in the first quarter, which we expect to recover throughout the rest of the year. And lastly, input costs are expected to be stable.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Tim. I'll turn to Slide 11 and give you some additional perspective on our progress we're making on our business strategies. Our teams across International Paper are advancing our strategies and capturing significant value. In the packaging business, which is on the left-hand side of this slide, our Box Go-to-Market strategy is focused on enhancing our capabilities and strong value propositions to improve margins and mix. We are making choices that create value for our customers while maximizing the profitability of our packaging business.  Earlier, Tim called out approximately $110 million of price and mix benefits realized in the first quarter. and we expect additional opportunities as we go through the year. In addition, we continue to make investments across our box network to improve our capabilities to serve customer needs and increase productivity. These projects have attractive financial returns and position our packaging businesses for profitable growth in the future.  In our Global Cellulose Fibers business, we also realized benefits from our optimization strategy by aligning our resources with the most attractive customers and segments and exposure to commodity grades. This shows up as margin and mix improvements in the first quarter. Across the enterprise, we also optimized our mill system and realized $34 million of fixed cost savings in the first quarter. These strategic initiatives across our portfolio are focused on accelerating margin improvement and driving profitable growth and will remain a high priority for our teams at IP.  Moving to Slide 12 and our CEO transition, I'd like to take a moment to express my personal gratitude for my journey with International Paper. It's been a privilege to be part of the IP family for my entire career. 4 years really goes by fast. When you work with outstanding people at a great company. While I enjoyed all the various roles and opportunities, I'm truly humbled and honored to have served as IP's leader for the past decade. During this time, we have become a more focused company and our financial foundation is strong, as are the principles and core values that guide our actions and decisions about how we operate.  Our team knows our mission matters that we improve people's lives by using renewable resources to make people depend on every day. We understand how important it is to help our customers solve problems and achieve their goods. And we're laser-focused on the things that are improving the company and making IP a very well positioned company for the future. I'm incredibly proud of our employees. I have seen them demonstrate time and time again their resilience and agility to overcome challenges. This was particularly evident during the global pandemic when our team showed up for work every day to get the job done, their dedication ensured people around the world had access to a variety of essential goods.  To everyone on the IP team in all our operations and offices around the globe for what you do each day and for making a difference, thank you. And to our shareowners, thank you for your continued confidence and investment in International Paper. It has been a remarkable journey for me being part of IP's 126-year legacy. I'm proud of how far our company has come and I'm looking forward to seeing how for International Paper will go.  And with that, we're ready to move to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew McKellar from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : I was wondering if you could start with just reconciling the benefits from the changes in your go-to-market strategy in the box business versus what you're expecting to start the year. And then it sounds like you're expecting some incremental benefits will flow through in Q2 and beyond. I was wondering if you could help us just quantify that. Mark Sutton : So Matthew, I think you're asking, we had outlooked closer to maybe $70 million and we overachieved that. Tom Hamic, I think, can walk you through a lot of moving parts on that. But I think he can walk you through how we basically overachieved our outlook. William Hamic : Sure. Thanks, Mark, and Matthew. I would say we exceeded the price component for 2 reasons. First of all, at the local level, we had better-than-expected improvement as we were starting Q4. So these are customers that are really the decisions are made in the field. Most of our forecast thinking about the improvement was focused on very large customers that are across the country. We exceeded the expectations there, but the big move was our investment in teams in the field, training, execution, driving benefit for our customers and frankly, getting a fair price that maybe we didn't in the past. I can say that the volume gap to market was almost exactly where we expected it. So these trade-offs are playing out the way we expected, but the margin improvement is more significant. Matthew McKellar : Great. And then I realize it's a pretty marginal change, but could you talk about what you're seeing in the market, either in Q2 so far? Or more generally, that led you to revise your expected North American industry box shipment growth to 2% to 3% in '24 from 3% previously? William Hamic : Sure, Matthew. This is Tom again. I would say that second quarter is going to be close to plus 2% for the industry. So that's an improvement from 4% to 1% to 2%. We expect that improvement to continue. But I would say 2% is probably in line with a fairly tough economic second half. And obviously, when you're forecasting the toughest things to predict or when you have a turn. And we are going to have a turn. Our customers do not have enough inventory. And at some point, they're going to have to reinvest in that base as the economy improves. And so our forecast, if you go down to 2%, that suggests no improvement at all and probably a fairly tough retail sales environment. I think it'd be closer to 3%, and I would not take 4% off the table. So a moderate adjustment to be conservative is what I would say. Matthew McKellar : Great. That's all for me. Mark, congratulations on the retirement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : First question, just wanted to understand the operations and costs in the packaging business. I think you talked being a negative $70 million 2Q v 1Q. And I think though at the same time, we should have about $50 million positive because we don't have the fire and we don't have the winter freeze issues. So that seems to be like a $120 million negative swing. So I was hoping to get kind of more specific as to why that number would be so large? Mark Sutton : Mark, this is Mark. That's a great question. I think it's 2 parts. It's the value chain, starting with containerboard and all the way through Box. Our prepared remarks talked about generically preparing for what we believe will be higher utilization as well as some of the spending is maintenance costs, but it really is in the box business to improve productivity and throughput. It's just not at the capital cost level. What I would like to do is ask Jay Royalty to talk a little bit about the containerboard part of the value chain, and then Tom can add some comments on the converting and box side. So Jay? Jay Royalty : Thanks, Mark, and Mark, thanks for the question. I think speaking to the containerboard side of the equation, there's a couple of things going on to keep in mind. One is the inflationary situation. So if you step back and think about what's happened in the last couple of years and how to think about that in the context of where we are, the cost to deliver the same value to customers has really increased dramatically over the last couple of years, and we see that again as we step into 2024, and we saw a meaningful impact in our 1Q numbers. We'll see -- and this is related to all of this inflation. And we'll see another step in 2Q. And then you can really think about that kind of leveling out from there.  And why that is the case is a lot of this inflation is labor related. When you think about labor flowing through all of these different things, but it's also front-end loaded as these contracts reset at really the beginning of the year. And so labor and benefits, maintenance services, operating supplies and materials, warehousing cost and even some kind of benign overhead expenses like insurance and property taxes, we all see those meaningfully up as we come into '24. And so that's one thing that's impacting the numbers in 1Q and then again in 2Q. The other thing, and Tim spoke to it in terms of the proactive maintenance spending. If you think about how we've been operating for the last several quarters in light of the lower demand environment, we have been modulating our spending in reaction to that. But as you heard us talk about, we're seeing more and more evidence of the recovery really across all the channels. And we need to be ready for that. We're in the early stages, but it's going to continue to ramp and we need to be ahead of that. So on -- Tom will talk about the box side on the mill side, I would characterize it as a very modest step up.  But given our size and scale, the numbers are not insignificant, but it's really about trying to get ahead of that. And these are things like ongoing maintenance and repairs to support productivity, efficiency, reliability across all [ facets ] of the mill, the pulp areas, the power areas and the paper as well. So it's really about increasing that cadence and then depending on how the demand plays out from here, we'll modulate that accordingly. William Hamic : Mark, this is Tom Hamic. I think, Jay and Mark laid it out very well. I would say the one difference with the box business because we are increasing maintenance spending is that it's very targeted to places where either we've struggled with reliability or we have an opportunity to grow. So if you look across the country, it's not that we're spreading the maintenance dollars. We're really reacting to the marketplace and the strength of demand. And then we're targeting maintenance spending to improve reliability for those customers. While at the same time, we're improving our margins. So this real focus on reliability and delivering on time, it's going to pay off. Mark Weintraub : Okay. So are we -- would you say that what we're going to see in the second quarter is cut back to what you think to be your normal type of -- given where the world is today, your normal levels of maintenance type spending, et cetera, et cetera? Or are we spending even a bit extra now to make up for maybe having spent a little bit before? Or is there even further increases that we might -- it didn't sound like there'd be further increases going forward. But maybe just clarify, are we just kind of at normalized spend levels in the second quarter and we were just a bit below previously? Is that the way to think about it? William Hamic : Mark, this is Tom Hamic again. I think there is a large part of it that is adjusting. But I think the key is what I talked about earlier is we've got to respond to the market, and we can't wait for the market then respond. And so there's a bit of this that is getting ready, as Jay talked about, for what we see as an expansion in box demand going forward. And one of the really positive things about maintenance expense in the box plants is what we've seen is a very short payback. So we're seeing the results. We're tracking the results and I feel very good. It really is our fastest way to react to customer needs. And so I feel very confident what we're spending is going to pay off. Mark Sutton : So Mark, I think what Jay described on the mill side is true in packaging. It's also true in Cellulose Fibers, modulating our spending over the last, let's say, 4 to 5 quarters as we were running both businesses at less than target output, which would be somewhere in the 94% to 95% output. It's been much lower than that, as you know, based on the demand environment. And so we stretched those dollars over a longer period of time because we didn't need our plants to run at maximum output. So now we're preparing to be running more toward our target output.  The only thing I would call out that's maybe a little bit of an abnormality in the mill system is it just so happens timing of some of these projects that are related to power generation. So in some of our integrated mills, we have major preventive maintenance shutdowns of some of the turbine generators that generate our steam and electricity. Those aren't done every year. they're sequenced, but you have to get them done in a certain window. There's a few extra turbine generator major scheduled maintenance roles, jobs in this period of time that we would normally have. So you take that out, then I think the rest of it is preparing to be at a more -- I don't like to call it 1 full but a more targeted run environment. Mark Weintraub : Got it. Thanks, guys, and thank you, Mark, for your clear explanation there and for your clarity last years you've been working and congrats on the retirement. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Charlie Muir-Sands from BNP Paribas. Charlie Muir-Sands: Yes. I just want to stay with 2, please. Firstly, just in terms of the market prices and the recognition of the $40 per ton increase that [indiscernible] put through in March, followed by no further change in April. Is it your expectation that relative to the higher numbers that you and others announced at the start of the year that we won't see any further recognition unless there's further price increases made? And then the second question, just related to the corporate expenses, $24 million in the first quarter compared with $60 million to $80 million guided for the year. Have you got any view on how Q2 might shape up specifically and whether for the full year, you might now be perhaps looking towards the upper end of that range given the large number in Q1? Mark Sutton : Charlie, this is Mark Sutton. Thank you for your questions. I'll take the first one and our CFO, Tim Nicholls, will take the second one on the corporate expenses. On the pricing, we don't comment on forward-looking pricing. We obviously -- IP had an announcement of $70, $40 was recognized. There's lots of reasons for that in the way that the index discovers price through the analytics. So, I think we would just stop there and say that's what we had. That will flow through the next few quarters, but we really don't -- we don't forecast or talk about forward pricing that hasn't kind of published in an index. Tim, do you want to take the corporate expense question? Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Great. Charlie. So we don't break it out quarter by quarter. There's a lot of -- normally we keep at corporate. There's a lot of things that have some volatility to them. We still feel good about the $60 million to $80 million for the year. But we capture things like FX movements and there's some unallocated subs and things like that. So there's a lot of moving parts running through. And generally, you can estimate it for a full year, it can bounce around quarter by quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland from Truist Securities. Michael Roxland : You Mark, Andy, Tim and Mark for taking my questions, and Mark I just want to echo what everybody else says, congrats on the retirement and all the years following through. Mark Sutton : Thanks, Mike. Michael Roxland : Just wanted to get a sense, going through this commercially or margin improvement in industrial packaging. What type of EBITDA margin are you looking to achieve and over what time frame? And can you help us frame how this should play out within [ the next few years ] itself? Mark Sutton : I think the number we've always thrown out there was an EBITDA margin that led us to a really strong ROIC, several hundred basis points above our cost of capital. At yesterday's revenue line, that used to be in the 20s. But I think for us, that's an aspirational target to get back into that area. But even at today's revenue and 18% margin generates very strong ROIC similar to what a 21% margin used to generate. So I think that's the sort of milepost we're working toward now is getting up into those high teens, 18-ish percent on our way to 20%. And if you kind of take that to an ROIC, you've got a really strong kind of mid-teens ROIC in the packaging business. And then you put some growth on top of that, and I think the value creation can be pretty powerful. Michael Roxland : And based on where you stand today, Mark, where do you -- that 18% margin, when do you see that occurring? Is there something that occurs next year next 2 years? And how do you see that unfolding in the near term? Mark Sutton : I think the answer to that question is going to depend a lot on what Tom Hamic talked about, and that is this steady improvement in demand and the consumer and when this turn occurs, obviously, those margins would be indicative of a healthy economy, which leads to a healthy box market. So we would think several quarters before we're sitting at that point. But we should see a step change in improvement in the margins as we go through quarter by quarter by quarter. I'd like to say a point in time in '25, but it's really going to depend on the demand environment but it's not that far in the future. Michael Roxland : Got it. And just one follow-up. I think you had a recent conference, you mentioned a change in the customer mix, pre-COVID versus post-COVID and the different margin profiles you have [indiscernible] pending with. So can you provide more color about changing your customer mix, pre-COVID versus post-COVID, any regional impacts that mix would have as well? Mark Sutton : Yes. That's a good question, Mike. At that conference, what I was discussing during COVID on some of our large contractual type customers that are in certain types of end-use segments, their growth rate was so astounding, and we had an obligation, if you will, to support their demand either as a percentage of their buy or some other metrics inside our contracts. And they grew at an outsized rate the other segments and some of the smaller customers. And as it absorbed basically all of our capacity, we had to leave certain customers in certain segments where we didn't have those contractual obligations because we just had no more room in our converting system.  So that's what I was trying to describe, these are not impacting customers. They're all great customers. It's not ever the customer's fault. They grew very fast and we met their demand. But it cost us in margin because some of the customers that we didn't have row for were actually more profitable. They were regional and local type customers. So the mix ended up shifting more toward very large, what we would call, national accounts as a percentage of our total business. And what we're doing now is in those large national accounts, improving the economics now that the contracts are open post COVID. Some of them were 2 years, some of them were 3-year contracts.  And where we can, we're improving the economics, and that's what Tom has been describing. That was a portion of the -- a large portion of the $110 million in the first quarter. Where we're not able to work with our customer to improve the economics and they may have a better alternative we will lose that amount of volume, free up that capacity retarget the original segments and customers that we disappointed a few years ago. And the good news is we've been suppliers to most of these people for very long periods of time. And while it was painful, we're getting opportunities to go back into these customers that we serve for so many years.  So a real external shock created demand profiles that were very abnormal. We did our best to meet all our obligations, ended up in spot especially with post-COVID inflation and demand declines and contractual limits of spot economically we didn't like. And so we're doing is getting back to the most profitable mix that we can have. If you think about converting, Mike, it's basically hours of time you have on your converting machinery to add value to containerboard in the form of making a package. So maximizing profitability per hour or converting time you have to offer to the market is always the challenge and the equation, the value creation algorithm that the Box business uses. And that just got skewed for us, not necessarily because we wanted it to, but because we did what we thought was the right thing to do for our customers during that period of time based on the commercial contracts we signed pre-COVID. Michael Roxland : Great color and good luck in retirement, Mark. Operator : And your final question for today comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Gabe Hajde : Mark, I like to echo everyone's comments. I think we told you also that congratulations. Hope you get to enjoy the time. I'm going to try to come back to the maintenance and investment question. I looked at average maintenance outage expense pre-pandemic in an average of about $250 million. During the pandemic over the past 4 years, including 2024, I think it was averaging about $380 million, $130 million more maintenance expense we're investing. And now we're talking about some cost -- additional costs running through the P&L. I don't know if you quantified it for us, but it seems like it's maybe at least $100 million in the second quarter, correct me if I'm wrong. So maybe just help us with dimensionalizing some of these costs where maintenance would go next year sort of an ordinary environment? And what sort of return are you expecting on the capital or the extra costs that are flowing through the P&L? Mark Sutton : Gabe, let me start just at a high level. So the $250 million you talked about, you could probably put a 40% inflation number across that spend. Typically, maintenance is half materials and half labor. Some labor is in annual outages and it's labor that we don't provide in specialty works. So we hired that labor during those 2-week outages. And so that $250 million automatically jumps up in the neighborhood of 40% more.  Now the numbers you've quoted at $380 million, $400 million, that's more like 50% more. Some of that is additional targeted spending and a lot of that's in the box business. It shows up as maintenance spending, not capital expense because box plant projects tend to be small enough in many cases, where we don't need a new machine, we just upgrade an existing machine, that flows through the P&L as an expense. A lot of the mill projects are so expensive and large and OEM equipment is of a scale that it ends up flowing through our CapEx in that $1 billion of CapEx.  So the way we think about it, and I'll ask Jay and Tom maybe to give you some particulars, we look at the cash investment in our business, whether it's a maintenance expense or whether it flows capital as the investment in protecting today's cash flows via reliability and generating tomorrow's cash flows in the box business via new capacity and capability and in the middle business by lowering our cost changing grade structures and those types of things. But the 40% is inflation in that neighborhood is the part that I think a lot of people miss. And while inflation isn't going up as much, there's no deflation in any of that stuff. There's some deflation of energy inputs and all that. There's no deflation in what drives maintenance cost. It's just going up less fast than it was. So Jay and Tom, do you want to add a little bit of color. Jay Royalty : Yes. I think the inflation comments are right on. It's a very extraordinary period that we're in versus the last decade or a couple of decades, and so certainly a step change in that regard. I think the other thing to keep in mind, Gabe, is this, we have been intentionally -- we've been intentionally spending at lower levels for the last several quarters to match the lower demand environment. And as we see the early stages of recovery and making sure that we're ready to ramp with that as it comes, we're stepping up. So that's the other piece, I think, to keep in mind in terms of these comparisons. Tom, I don't know if you... William Hamic : Sure. And I think Mark, Gabe, summed it up well. I would say the increase if you're -- there is an increase in the box spending that is focused on reliability. If there's any change in our focus, I would say that in the past, we were comfortable running over time. So say, 2 Saturdays a month in a box plant. But that doesn't -- that might you get the orders made, but it doesn't satisfy the reliability. So we've become very focused on on-time delivery and quality. And there is significant amount of maintenance spending that we're targeting towards that shift. And frankly, it supports our margin structure going forward. Gabe Hajde : Okay. You guys did outperform, if I go back to the bridge on a sequential basis, you talked about flattish pricing. It was plus 57%. So it's clearly showing up. We didn't build a better IP in this presentation formally talked about. Is it incorrect to annualize that $110 million number? Is there a reason why it's more pronounced here in the first quarter? Or just, again, any way to think about that? Because it I mean that in and other health was, I think, a big part of a better IP and it's shown up in the numbers now here. Mark Sutton : Gabe, this is Mark. I think you broke up on the first part of your question, but I think we got the gist of it. On the $110 million, yes, it's a fair assessment to say you can annualize that number. And that is definitely inside of the build better IP. But I didn't hear the very first -- we didn't hear the very first part of your question when you were referencing the bridge, one of the bridges. Gabe Hajde : The sequential price rate you guys outperformed, I think, by $57 million. So it was just... Mark Sutton : Yes, that's the part we didn't hear Yes, that's correct. And that's the right way to think about it. Operator : You have one last question. That question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Philip Ng : Well, I'm glad I got to get on this call because I wanted to thank you, Mark, for all the help over the years, really appreciate it.  I guess, first off, you're certainly seeing a lot of inflation, and you guys are putting real dollars here to be positioned to capitalize on a better demand environment. So my question is really, do you think you're getting paid for these investments? So is there another opportunity we should be mindful of in the not too distant future? And as you implement these latest box price increases, are there levers here where you could potentially drive more than the $40 linerboard increase that went through in February, especially as you kind of move forward with this Go-to-Market strategy of yours? William Hamic : Yes, this is Tom Hamic. I think we can comfortably separate the 2. So the improvement you saw in Q1, as Mark said, it's sustainable. The $40, I expect to be like it always is. I mean if you think back to previous price increases, you should feel confident that it's going to flow through the same way. But I would see those a bit separate. In terms of continuing the margin expansion there's a lot that gives me confidence. Piece 1 is we're investing significantly in our commercial capability. And that's a shift. We've always focused on commercial, but not as much as we are going forward.  And I think the other piece is where we really understand segments, and we are very close to those segments and the value proposition, we are very successful in terms of market growth and in terms of margin structure. And so our job is to take that capability, and this is what we're doing and build a better -- I mean, Go-to Market is expanding that to other segments. So there's know-how in the company. This is really the change for us of driving that across the entire business. Philip Ng : Got you. Okay. That's helpful color. I guess my question -- my next question is just really on the operations front. I know there in the COVID years, you had some operational headwinds that perhaps limited your ability to kind of grow the market, you're obviously going through a stretch here with the Go-to-Market strategy. But when we kind of think going forward, are you set up properly now to kind of growth of market on the operations front in terms of production. And then some of the investments you've made on the box side, give us an update there. Are you starting to see that take hold and be well received in the marketplace? And as you kind of pivot to maybe a better mix in customers, give us a little perspective on, is there a target percentage in terms of regional customers versus national in some medium- to longer-term time frame? William Hamic : Sure. That's a great question. I'll take a couple of pieces of it. I think in terms of the investments, if you look at the first quarter, we still have a bit of a weight of new employees, and that's why we're very on retention. But new employees are not as productive as experienced employees. However, when we look at the productivity across our machines, even though we have a few extra people in place, it's not significant to the financials but a few extra people, we are seeing productivity improvement for the first time in a long time. And so I feel like those investments are at a very good payback rate. And we're -- it's not insignificant, these are 2%, 3% improvements in throughput.  And I think the most positive shift we've made in terms of our capital process and our maintenance expenses, we have spent a lot of time, put a lot of people in place to make sure that the local decisions are primary. What's happening in that market? Why? Tie that back to the national piece and make sure that we're reacting to the market because I'm talking, not all 120 plants are in the same position. You've got to be very targeted and where you spend the money, which is what we're doing.  And then to your last question, I would expect that as a percentage of our business, the local business will grow over the next couple of years. It's improving faster right now than the national business, and we know that when you have the capability to match the local demand, it is much more profitable than the national. And so I don't see some huge swing where we're abandoning national accounts but I do see a rebalancing similar to what Mark talked about in the segment discussion. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Sutton for closing comments. Mark Sutton : Thank you, Greg. And I'd like to wrap up today's call by sharing my conviction that International Paper is well positioned for the future. Andy Silvernail steps in the CEO role next week on May 1. I'm very confident his leadership experience and proven track record, combined with the industry expertise of our senior leadership team will amplify the company's success going forward. When I provided updates along the way about the CEO succession process, I said the Board was looking for the right leader for the company's next chapter, and I am confident that Andy is that leader. Andy and his team will look forward to sharing updates with you starting on next quarter's call. Thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in International Paper. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's International Paper's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Allan. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's second quarter earnings call. Our speakers this morning are Andy Silvernail, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There was important information at the beginning of our presentation including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements can be found in our press releases and reports filed with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the second quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. With that, I'll turn it over to Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mark. Hey, good morning to everybody in the Americas and good afternoon to all of our friends in Europe. I'm excited to have joined the IP team with our rich history, important mission, and dedicated, talented people. Prior to joining IP, I spent a decade as CEO of IDEX Corporation, where we delivered strong, consistent results through great teams, customer obsession, and embracing an 80/20 operating system. I also spent several years working with private equity, where speed and impact are at a premium. I've been asked many times since my announcement, why IP? The bottom line is that through my deep diligence, very similar to how I approach acquisitions, I found a company that matters in terms of its mission, a company with solid underpinnings, and a company with a lot of opportunity for improvement and significant upside potential. It is absolutely a diamond in the rough. I spent my first 90 days on a learning journey with the goal of getting fact-based insights, aligning the team, dimensionalizing the opportunity, and launching the improvement plan. It's been a powerful experience, an opportunity to speak with employees, customers, suppliers, and investors. All of this has reinforced my initial beliefs and opened new insights. Let's turn to slide five. So before we go through the quarter, I'm going to talk about the case for change International Paper. And later in the presentation, I'm also going to talk about what we're planning to do differently to drive significant change at IP and significantly improve performance. So I'm going to spend a few minutes walking you through some of the data that highlights the challenges we faced as a company in a very candid, fact-based way. The data and feedback have told me that most of our performance issues are self-induced. And as a result, these can be fixed with intense focus on the right strategy and courage to do what must be done. I'm going to start on slide six. You can see 10 years of data here. These are the facts that I know as owners of IP you appreciate. We have underperformed on every meaningful metric. You can see the realities of sales, margin, and profitability decline. And although it's not on this chart, our return on invested capital has followed the same trend and is underwater today. I want you, as our share owners, to know I understand this is totally unacceptable and we are going to fix it. But to fix it, we need to understand the root cause, we must face the brutal facts and do something very different. Let's go to slide seven. IP's performance deterioration has been exacerbated by some very important choices in capital allocation and resource allocation. You can see over the past decade, we've spent more than $35 billion, including returning cash to share owners, making investments, and improving the balance sheet. Let me start with the efforts around the balance sheet. We made excellent choices here, deleveraging and funding our pension. A strong balance sheet is foundational and gives us great degrees of freedom for value creation. But we've also spent more than $12 billion on dividends and share repurchases. Both of these tools can create substantial value if used well, but are value destructive if used poorly. IP will pay an attractive dividend. We can support our dividend at the current level and we will grow into it as performance improves. But as I think about share repurchases, when and how you do it really matters. As with most companies, IP purchased shares when cash was generated, but not in the mind of maximizing the opportunity based on market factors and intrinsic value. The remaining spend, $2 billion on acquisitions and $12 billion on CapEx have not generated the returns we expect. I'm now turning to slide eight. Importantly, our spending since 2018 on investments that drive performance for customers and productivity have lagged. I'm not saying that we can't be more efficient with capital than our competition, but we pushed the envelope too far. While our mills are well capitalized and advantaged, we spent too much on unproductive capacity and haven't stayed ahead of the curve. We have under-invested in our box system. On the right-hand side is where you can see this show up. We've underspent on maintenance and repair, and this is the heartbeat of our operations and what drives reliability for our customers and productivity. These numbers are supported by the conversations I'm having with our folks across our system, particularly in maintenance. We've got an incredibly long list of great opportunities that need capital to drive performance for our customers and expand profitability. When we're driving excellent reliability internally, we get excellent reliability externally, and we will excel for our customers and get paid for value. That means we've got to spend some money. And I believe we can do that with capital playing in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion per year. If opportunities exist and drive results, by expanding those investments, we will do so. I'm turning to Slide nine. This is probably the most important slide that we're going to go through here today, that and capital allocation. The lack of investment back into the businesses has directly contributed to a cost problem. Operating costs have ballooned on modest sales growth. The good part here is that it's in our control. We can attack this and control our own destiny. What doesn't show up on this page is the impact of the slippage of reliability for our customers. Reliability, defined as quality, delivery, and service, is the most important factor for the vast majority of our customers. We made our own bed here under investing in cost that has lost its market share over the past decade. The share loss will continue over the near term, but again, we know how to reverse this and control our own destiny. We've done a lot of work commercially to position ourselves correctly in the market. We've made sensible value over volume trade-offs recently, and we're ramping up our commercial talent, capability, and incentives. We have lost other share where we let customers down. We will change this by being the leader in reliability. We've made some solid progress in on-time delivery, and our corrugator and converter capacity is up. But we have more to do to arrest the share slide. I'm now turning to slide 10. I'll talk about this of where to build from and things to improve. IP has a strong culture of ethics. We work with integrity. This is a really hard thing to change within an organization, and we have a great foundation here. We have talented, experienced people up and down the organization. I'm finding them willing to face the reality and embrace significant change. My team wants to win. They are tired of getting their butts kicked. My job is to focus and align them on the critical few and away from the trivial many. The strongest thing we have to build from is our North American Packaging franchise. Our packaging franchise is incredibly valuable and has tremendous upside potential with the right strategy. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a strong financial foundation. Turning to the opportunities for improvement, we are embracing an 80/20 operating system to do four things. First, an outside-in customer-driven strategy that differentiates through reliability and leverages our reach. Second, optimize our cost structure. Third, align our team and resources toward differentiation and profitable growth. Finally, we will instill a high-performance culture that achieves superior results. In a little bit, I'm going to talk about how we are embracing 80/20 to drive results. So now let me turn to the second quarter about performance and the outlook. I'll share some highlights and then turn it over to Tim to walk through the details. I'm now on slide 12. Our second quarter earnings were higher than the first quarter, but relatively unchanged year-over-year. We saw a sequential improvement driven by higher sales across our sales prices across the portfolio, and we got benefit from seasonally higher box volumes. Regarding the market environment, they were stable to moderately better demand. However, IP's packaging volumes came in below our expectations and continued to lag the overall market, and that will continue for some time. We've seen expected volumes decline from repositioning and optimizing value and volume. We do have residual effect from a history of underinvesting in certain regions and markets where we have ongoing reliability and capacity issues that we are addressing and have seen improvement in already. We need to make sure that we are close to the market, pricing appropriately, and investing to be the leader in reliability. As I mentioned earlier, we're focused on investing and differentiation, and we are seeing specific results that are leading indicators to positive change. It will, however, be messy over the next three to four quarters. We expect near-term performance to be challenged by seasonally lower volumes and higher mill outage expense. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim to provide more details about our second quarter performance and our outlook. Timothy Nicholls : Thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 13 now, where I'll provide the details around the second quarter as we walk through the sequential earnings bridge. Second quarter adjusted operating earnings per share was $0.55 as compared to $0.17 in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter included a $0.10 per share drag related to the January freeze and the Ixtac box plant fire. Price of mix was higher by $0.23 per share driven by the flow through of prior price index movements as well as margin and mixed benefits from successfully executing our Box Go-to-Market strategy and our GCF optimization strategy. Volume was favorable by $0.06 per share. Although we continue to see favorable demand trends, deploying our commercial strategies across the portfolio continues to impact volumes in the near term as expected as we transition based on our strategy. Operations and cost was unfavorable by $0.01 per share sequentially. This is largely from the impact of inflation, higher S&A, and spending to improve reliability in our packaging business. Partially offset by mill efficiencies following the pulp machine closure at our Riegelwood Mill. Maintenance outages were lowered by $16 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter and input costs were overall flat sequentially with decreased costs for energy and freight offsetting increased costs for OCC and chemicals. And finally, corporate items favorably impacted earnings by $0.07 per share sequentially due to a lower effective tax rate. Turning to the segments and starting with industrial packaging, second quarter results on slide 14, price and mix was higher due to the realization of approximately $45 million of benefits from prior index movement. Additionally, benefits from our Box Go-to-Market strategy contributed approximately $25 million of earnings benefit from improved margins and mix. And higher export and mix contributed approximately $21 million. Volume was higher by $27 million sequentially given stable to improving demand trends we are seeing. However, as expected, our Box Go-to-Market strategy is about making choices that impacts our volume in the near term. Although we expect to trail the industry for the next few quarters, we believe our Box Go-to-Market strategy will allow us to improve our margins and mix over the long-term. Operations and costs was $43 million unfavorable sequentially due to the impacts of inflation, higher S&A, and spending to improve reliability. Planned maintenance outages were higher by $3 million sequentially and input costs were $3 million favorable primarily due to lower energy more than offsetting higher OCC costs. Moving to slide 15, I'll cover the Global Cellulose Fiber second quarter. Price and mix was sequentially higher by $22 million due to the price index movement and GCF optimization strategy driving benefits from higher absorbent pulp mix and the reduction in commodity grades. Volume sequentially was relatively flat overall as improved demand for absorbent pulp was offset by lower cells of commodity grades as we continue to focus on strategically aligning our business with the most attractive customers and segments. Operations and costs was favorable sequentially by $36 million. A large portion of this benefit is related to the pulp machine closure at our mill in Riegelwood, North Carolina. Planned maintenance outages were lower in the second quarter by $19 million as planned. And finally, input costs were higher by $1 million with lower energy costs not quite offsetting higher chemical and wood costs. Turning to slide 16, I'm going to provide our outlook for the third quarter. As Andy said earlier, we expect lower sequential earnings due to volume decline and higher costs offsetting benefits from the prior price index increases. For our industrial packaging segment, earnings are expected to be down sequentially in the third quarter by approximately $160 million. And earnings will be relatively flat for Global Cellulose Fibers. Now let me give you the breakdown. I'll start with industrial packaging. We expect price and mix to improve earnings by approximately $60 million sequentially. This is the result of prior index movement in North America as well as higher export prices to date. I would also note that approximately $13 million of the expected improvement is related to our Box Go-to-Market strategy. Volume is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $65 million due to one less shipping day and seasonally lower demand. We expect operations and costs to decrease earnings by approximately $80 million. This includes higher reliability spending, labor and benefits costs during the summer months, and higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Higher maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease earnings by approximately $44 million. And lastly, higher input costs are expected to decrease earnings by approximately $30 million, primarily due to higher energy costs. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase earnings by approximately $10 million as a result of prior index movement. Volume is expected to decrease earnings in the third quarter by approximately $5 million due to seasonally lower demand. We expect operations and costs to decrease earnings by approximately $25 million, largely due to higher distribution costs and timing of spend, as well as higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings in the third quarter by approximately $25 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to be stable. With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Tim. I'll pick back up on slide 17. For over a decade, I've embraced an 80/20 operating system that has consistently produced superior results for customers and shareholders. At Ixtac, 80/20 became part of our DNA, and we delivered over 500% TSR over my tenure. One of the reasons I joined IP is that through my diligence, I found a very compelling case where 80/20 can produce significant results. 80/20 is a data-driven methodology that creates laser-like focus on customers, products, and resources that drive dramatic profitable growth. It's about simplifying so we can say yes to the critical few and no to the trivial many that create value-destroying complexity. Using this approach, we are reviewing the entire portfolio and sub segments as well as our enterprise functions. I'm now turning to slide 18 to talk about our 80/20 methodology. There are four steps to 80/20 that we're taking our entire business through and then sub segments of our business and the enterprise. Step one is about simplifying customers and products quickly to focus on attractive markets. We should never become good at something we shouldn't have done in the first place. Step two, we want to segment unlike businesses so we can focus on winning for the customer and driving results. Step three, we're going to align minimum resources. Different businesses have different resource intensity. We need to give them uniquely what they need to win. Step four is accelerating profitable growth through customer obsession that shows itself in great quality, delivery, service, value-based pricing, and innovation. Now let's turn to slide 19. The most important insight of 80/20 is the misalignment of what drives a business and how resources are typically applied. I've deployed 80/20 dozens of times and found this to be universally true. We had 40 businesses at Ixtac, and I brought the approach to private equity also. The bottom line is that unaffected, complexity grows out of control and each resources. IP is a very complex business, but we're complex by choice, not by necessity. We will simplify and focus IP. We will improve profitability while at the same time liberating resources to invest in differentiated capabilities for the most attractive customers, products, productivity, and capital allocation. My experience is that 80/20 is a highly differentiated approach that demands facing the brutal facts and by making courageous choices that dramatically improve results. Now let's turn to slide 20. So what will you, our customers, and our team experience? First, we will simplify to focus on the businesses, customers, and products where we will invest long-term and differentiate. Second, we'll segment the businesses to stand on their own. Third, we will zero up each business. You're going to hear that term zero up often, but we're going to zero up each business. This means we will rigorously understand what resources are needed to win for customers and deliver attractive profitability. Fourth, we will commit and align our people and our investment. Finally, we'll place authority and accountability close to the customer and decision-making to drive outstanding results. We'll take the same approach to the corporate center. Through the zero up, we are determining the minimum resources required to be a public company and then being very strategic about a small handful of things we will invest in to differentiate across the company. Turning to slide 21. We will be relentless in applying 80/20 across IP. We launched 80/20 shortly after I joined. We actually started the data process before I joined. We've completed much of the analytics that point us towards opportunity. IP has attractive and substantial upside. I believe that the current portfolio of IP has the potential to deliver $4 billion of EBITDA in a mid-cycle environment. The key drivers will be optimizing our cost structure to improve profitability, and very importantly, liberate resources. Investing in box plants for reliability and productivity. Investing in our mills for long-term performance and cost advantage. And investing in our commercial capabilities for innovation and sales talent. Ultimately, these will allow us to win for our customers and be rewarded for the value that we create for our customers. I'm turning to my final slide on 22. We're going to be laser focused, working with the teams to accelerate 80/20 and begin implementation. I commit to continue to engage with you and share updates. We're planning a roadshow in September, and we're also attending conferences. We'll update you on our progress at our next earnings call in October. We expect that required disclosure documents related to DS Smith acquisition will be published in late summer, and related meetings held in the early fall. And we will offer an 80/20 101 webinar on August 14th to give you an opportunity to learn more about 80/20 and how it drives change and results. So you'll get an invitation to attend that. Finally, we're going to have an Investor Day in March. This will give us an opportunity to share our progress at that time. The last thing that I want to say is I want to say thank you to the IP team. I have pushed them very hard in a very short period of time. I found people to be willing and able to tackle this important mission. People are bought into what we're trying to do, they understand the stakes at hand, and we're going after it. With that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Michael Roxland : Thanks very much, Andy, Tim, and Mark for taking my questions, and congrats on a good quarter. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. Michael Roxland : Morning. Wanted to get a little more color for you, Andy, on the 80/20 and also the box strategy. Obviously, you're pooling the portfolio for unprofitable business. How much of the business you intend to walk away from, or that you have walked away from, is truly unprofitable, where IP is actually losing money, rather than maybe it's just lower EBITDA or lower EBITDA margin business relative to other businesses? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Mike, that's a great question. So, look, a lot of people have the first experience that effectively what you're saying is you're going to exit a bunch of business. And what I have found to be true is, and again, having done this many, many times, that is actually not practically what happens over a very short period of time, an intermediate period of time, call it a year or two. What ends up happening is what you're doing is you're segmenting your business, you're understanding the drivers for those customers and those products, and you are really aggressively aligning resources, minimum resources, for what's required to win. And so, when we think of profitability, if you peanut butter spread overheads, which is what most companies do, right? You peanut butter spread most overhead. What you do is you're effectively saying your most attractive customers and your most attractive products, they typically get overburdened with overhead. So, it actually, it shows them in a typical accounting system, right? The peanut butter spreads overhead. It spreads them usually by revenue. And so, what you end up having, right, is an understatement of profitability for your most attractive segments and an overstatement of profitability for your less attractive. That being said, when you structure this correctly, when you go through segmentation, you simplify and go through segmentation, you're aligning the appropriate resources. And what I found when you're doing that, we use a gardening example, right? We use a farming example. That's why I showed those farming pictures. So, think of it as, you're farming and you make a decision that the thing you're going to farm for are tomatoes and pumpkins right that's what you decide you're going to farm for. So you simplify that's what we're going to do. When you segment you realize that tomatoes and pumpkins actually need different resources. So a pumpkin will take as much water as you can possibly give it and a tomato if you give it too much you're going to kill it. And so if you actually put them together you give them just enough water so both of them die, right? And it's a tough analogy but it's a true analogy. And what I would say is we are going to aggressively segment and we're going to give them just the water that they need to flourish. And what I found historically is there you can actually recover any volume loss that you decide you can actually recover from it pretty shortly because you're satisfying customer needs you're meeting customers where they are with the right amount of resources and you're getting real profitability which then drives returns long-term. Michael Roxland : Got you. Very, very clear. My follow-up then is how do you tend to deploy 80/20 with DS Smith because doesn't that add some complexity to the system I mean you mentioned trying to keep things simple and so with DS Smith being -- if when it closes I just walk us through how you're thinking about deploying 80/20 here standalone and then ultimately try to do that approach with DS Smith as well. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Yes Mike that's another great question. So the first thing is let's start with first principles when we buy the business right which is we want to segment. The reality is what happens in the North American market has very little influence on what happens in the in the European market, right. From a competitive standpoint because of the nature of the geography and the fact that the box businesses compete in a 150 to 200 mile radius the competitive issues don't overlap. And frankly the teams don't overlap. And so as we acquire DS Smith, what's really important is to treat it as its own platform in Europe. So there are really as I've said a few times to people, there -- they think of this as kind of three different pieces of integration. There's a relatively simple integration that happens in the Americas, right. They have a small handful of assets in the Americas that will integrate into our mills into our box system. It's a pretty small footprint. And in Europe it's really DS Smith that is integrating our European footprint. They are multiple times our size. They have done large acquisitions in the past. It's a capable team of people and so we have a wonderful team by the way in Europe that punch way above their weight. And so we're going to end up with a terrific overall team in Europe, but the integration is going to happen that way. And so that's infact, we'll focus our 80/20 efforts specifically in those regions in those sub regions of where they matter. And then the third part is corporate, and we had a call with our top leadership here this morning and I was very clear to them, we need to be incredibly smart about this integration at the corporate level. At the corporate level there's really only three things that have to happen. There are a few things that are shared and they're relatively small to get the savings that we know are out there and we should go get and it's a very small team of people who need to work on that. More importantly, is we need to bring them in, so we can close the books and be compliant, right? This is a public company that's very capable. What I don't want to do is overburden them, drive unnecessary administrative DS [ph] and things that destroy value, right? So the beautiful part is we're going to do this from scratch, and we're doing it with a business that is really terrific. And so that thinking has to start up front, Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from Charlie Muir-Sands with BNP Paribas. Go ahead. Charlie Muir-Sands: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Charlie. Charlie Muir-Sands: Regarding the -- thanks. Just regarding the reliability spending which is one of the sequential increases in the costs you've called out in the bridge into Q3. I guess you were talking about that a quarter ago already. How much of this 80 million step up it relates to that kind of spending as opposed to the seasonality and other aspects and how much of that should we think about being part of an ongoing run rate now or is it just a sort of short surge and then you compare it back again? Thank you. Timothy Nicholls : Yes. Hey good morning Charlie. It's Tim. So I would say there's a significant portion of it that's directly tied to reliability. We do have there's a little bit of timing between quarters and we did underspend the estimate that we thought for the second quarter. So some of that is bleeding [ph] into the third. But in terms of ongoing reliability spending, I think you can think of it over the next three, four, five quarters where we are getting the system to the point that it can sustainably be reliable and open up capacity. Andy Silvernail : Yes, and I'd add to that, Charlie. I think very importantly, the 80/20 methodology, if you think of it in two buckets, one is you improve profits, right? So we put some of it in our pockets and it's for you guys. And then a big piece of it is about liberating resources, right? And we know full well that we're not coming to you guys and asking for more money, right? We've got to figure out how to do this in the resource base we have and we've got plenty to go from with tough choices. And so this should be self-funding, we should liberate resources, and we should be able to accelerate spending and reliability. I mean, it is, it's hard to overstate how important this is, right? When you look at the vast majority of customers, and I'm going to say 80 plus percent of customers, they, by far, their number one concern or their number one goal is reliability. They do not want to think about us, to be very clear, right? They do not want to think about us, and if we are a partner with them who solves their problems and does it in the right way, we're in a great spot, and we've let folks down, right? We have let folks down in the last five to ten years on this regard. The nice part is this is something that's relatively easy to fix, right? So if you look at the focus reliability spending that's happened just since I've been here, you're already starting to see benefits. So if you think about a corrugator and converting assets, right, that dramatically improves our capability, and as you up maintenance spending and you don't have breakdowns that also dramatically improves reliability. So this is a critically important part of the game. If you break it into three pieces, right, reliability, the reach that we have, our depth and breadth geographically is a tremendous asset, and then ultimately innovation. And so we need to invest in those pieces, and we need to self-fund it. Charlie Muir-Sands: Thank you. My follow-up question just relates back to the go-to-market strategy. It's obviously been another 13 weeks since you effectively implemented it. It appears so far that the pace of market share losses has probably been stable. We haven't obviously seen every competitor report or the industry data yet. But are you confident that there is a NPV positive payoff going on, and there's no risk that customers aren't still shopping around, and maybe three, six months down the line you're going to see another wave of departures? Andy Silvernail : That's a great question, Charlie. So what I would say in terms of high confidence, right? So we're tracking that, and we know what has been -- what agreements have been signed, and we know what has been -- what is unsigned, right? So we know where we have gotten -- where deals are done and where they're not. I think Tim was -- do you think it's kind of where 75% plus -- 75% kind of through that in terms of -- I'm going to say the contractual deals, how that flows still takes time, right? It takes time to flow through the system. So we're very much on track with the expectations. If you look at the accounts where we have really applied this go-to-market strategy, we are very much in line with the expectations. So that feels good. The negative surprise, and I think the negative surprise, over the next few quarters and why I'm signaling exactly what I'm signaling is that, there is a lag to reliability, right? So the stuff that was being shopped in the first and second quarter because people weren't getting the things that they needed, how they needed it, that's showing up now and will continue to show up. So those two things together are the net of market share loss. And that pipeline, unlike some businesses that go into a quarter with say, half the business book. So in my IDEX stage, we had about half the business book when we went into a quarter. We don't have that here, right? So it's hard to look at a correlation against something like that. So what you're really looking at is the health of the pipeline. And I would say we're okay at that. We got work to do to get really good at that. And I'm working with Tom Hammack and team to get much, much better at understanding the pipeline, what that looks like over time, and having the ability to call that in a way that's based on stuff that we know uniquely versus the overall economy. And so we got to get better there. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. First, thanks for laying out an exciting vision for the future, but I'm still sort of trying to work through a little bit why the magnitude of pain, short term? And has reliability or those issues become even more significant that's leading to what looks to be an accelerated decline in the box volumes? Maybe if you can just kind of walk how much of it was the go-to market versus the reliability and is that different? Andy Silvernail : Yes, if you actually look at the balance of go-to market and I'll call it other stuff, right, let's just call it other. The total is about 50-50, right? So if I look at now through really the second quarter and we believe that that would be investments in reliability, that other part shrinks and we feel like we're dialed in on the go-to market piece of that. So that's kind of how it plays out. No, reliability hasn't gotten worse, but I think what it's doing is the timing of how it moves through the system. And look, overall, the pricing environment has gotten more robust, right? So people are shopping more in the overall environment. And so our ability to make sure we're the leaders in reliability consistently on an ongoing basis is the game. And so look Mark, there's no doubt in my mind that this is going to be bumpy, right, as we work through this and the investments are going to take some time. It's not three years away, that's not what I mean, but I think the next three or four quarters, we're going to see some chopping there and it's going to be a little bit hard to call. And that's a conversation I know I've had with a lot of people who are on the call today. That is my expectation and that is what's playing out. Mark Weintraub : Can you share, I know you noted that you expect now the industry to be up about 1% to 2%. Can you share what you expect IPs, box shipments, this year to be relative to last year? Timothy Nicholls : For the quarter or for the year, Mark? Mark Weintraub : For the year. Timothy Nicholls : For the year, it's really hard and we can't forecast the fourth quarter because of issues with the transaction. Look, I think Andy said it, there's chop and we're going to have some up and down, but we're working with the market, 1% to 2%, and we've got to see how all of these negotiations play out and the follow through on getting the price to a competitive level and then what that means for volume. Andy Silvernail : Yes, and I think I add on there, Mark, just so everyone on the call is very, very clear and so you don't think we're being cagey about it. We actually have a legal responsibility through the U.K. takeover code. We cannot say anything that is construed as a forecast for the fourth quarter. That would trigger a whole bunch of things. So we can share in the normal course of business how we look at the third quarter. We're not allowed to share with time specificity and outlook past that without going through some very specific steps that we will go through as we post the proxy. We do have to go through that, but we have to be very careful on this call. So I apologize for that opaqueness, but we really have a responsibility that we have to keep to. Operator : Your next question will come from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Gaurav Jain : Thank you for taking my question. So two from me. One, this uplift in EBITDA from $2 billion to $4 billion, does it include DS Smith\u2019s EBITDA? Or this is just for IP? Andy Silvernail : No, it does not. No, that does not include it. No, that is for the current IP portfolio. Gaurav Jain : Sure, thank you. And then like it's a very big jump in EBITDA and you are not really calling out any incremental CapEx over and above what the run rate has been. So, like the return on these incremental investments is significantly high and probably more than anything we have seen in the industry. So what does, like are you budgeting for CapEx in the guidance properly? Timothy Nicholls : So I think the question was around capital spending to support the value growth. Gaurav Jain : Yes. Timothy Nicholls : Yes, so what we're looking at is somewhere between a $1 billion and $1.2 billion one on a normalized basis. There could be periods where because of the opportunity, we might want to invest a little bit above that level to support the strategy. But it's really largely around the same level of capital that we normally target. We think we can do it within that. Andy Silvernail : But I think very importantly, right? How that capital is going to be spent is going to be different, right? So I would say one of the sins of the past, so to speak, if you look at all that capital spending that I outlined in the discussion in the prepared remarks, if you look at that capital spending over the last 10 years, that peanut butter spread mentality, the whipsaw of chasing bad investments or assets that are deteriorating, that eats up a dramatic disproportionate amount of our investment. And so our ability to focus that on the right assets in the right geographies, box plant and in mills in the U.S. and in Europe is going to be very important, right? So as you think about the sheer change that could happen by location it can be pretty substantial. And we did that pretty dramatically at IDEX, right? When we made those choices. Our CapEx, it went up a little bit. But more than anything else, it got proportioned very differently. It got proportion towards building sustainable competitive advantage. It got proportioned to drive productivity. It got proportioned to really a great work environment. And in that environment, right, we drove about 700, 800 basis points of ROIC over that time frame. And so I know it can be done. And the great part here is we have -- because of the nature of our assets and the focus of our assets, we know how to pull this off, right? We just have to have the courage to move the resources and make the tough choices. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Gabe good morning. Gabe Hajde : Good morning. I appreciate the candor and transparency and also [Indiscernible] pumpkins and peanut butter and getting me ready for lunch. I wanted to go to Slide eight, the prior question sort of asked what I was thinking on the 1.5 points to differential and CapEx relative to your peers. You addressed that -- the fees for the 7 per million square feet the $0.40 differential. Should I interpret that as, okay, maintenance costs have come up to, I think, this year, now you're talking about $530 million is that there's another $40 million to $50 million in there, all else equal. Or does that piece of it get reflected in ops and costs? How should we think about that? Andy Silvernail : Yes. I think it's more just going to show up in option cost. There is capital investment that goes into maintenance and repair, but this number is about operating costs. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And then you talked about wanting to be self-funded free up resources and one of the implications here is seemingly free up some capacity, which in today's environment isn't necessarily what IP or the industry needs. And you're also saying, hey, 80/20, we need to focus on what's important. Should we take away from that, that there could be some additional capacity coming out of the system as you work through this process over the next medium term, if you will? Andy Silvernail : You have to expect that, right? I mean, ultimately, when you think about our overall cost buckets, we've got to make sure we match capacity with overall demand with opportunity to be successful, right? So we've got to be very thoughtful about that. We'll do it appropriately as we do that. But as we think about structural cost, we got to be honest about where the structural costs are. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng : Andy, the presentation was pretty inspirational here. I guess in many aspects, this is a hard reset in the IP culture kind of running it from more of a commodity business to more entrepreneurial and focus on the box side of things being profitable. I guess my question is, how has the buying been internally? And then these investments you're making on reliability, certainly, there's going to be some drag in the next few quarters. When do we kind of start seeing that ramp up on the positive side and flow through a little more fully? And lastly, do you have the right people in infrastructure, help you be informed to make these decisions in terms of where you want to align capital in the right places? Andy Silvernail : I think, look, one of the major positive surprises when you come into a situation like this, right, long-term poor performance and not kind of dealing with some of the major issues that need to be dealt with. You worry about what you're going to find, right? You worry about what you're going to find. And I will tell you, I have been extremely positively surprised by the capability and the willingness. So the team is willing and they are able. The pent-up frustration and the pent-up excitement about running this company the way it should be run is palatable. And what I have seen is just people grabbing on to a desire to get better and very specifically, grabbing on to 80/20, right? We are moving at a pace. Again, I've done this an awful lot. And the pace at which this group has been willing to engage and their ability to engage has been frankly inspiring. They've done a great job with that. And so we've got great people at IP. I'll put this group against any group of people. And I mean up and down the organization, I've spent a lot of time in box plants and mills. We've got great people. My father in law was a 37-year IP employee. When IP bought Champion back a long time ago, my father in law went with that. He retired as an IP employee. So right after he asked me whether or not his pension was safe, we talked a lot about maintenance. And so I have a real affinity for those folks within our business. And when I go and I talk to them, these people are fantastic, right? They're absolutely fantastic. I came in this morning, I was given a hat from our Riegelwood facility, and it's a precision maintenance hat. I went there and I had a chance to sit in on some bearings training and listening to these folks, these are incredibly capable folks who they need the focus and they need the resources to win. They know how to do with the list of high-return projects by facility, by location is awesome. And the need for us to allow them to win we need for us to -- they need us to allow them to win. So I feel really good about the team and about the engagement. Look, we're going into the next phase of this, right? In the next phase, there are kind of tough phases here. One is the buy-in, which you had talked about, and we've got it, we have got buy-in. And frankly, our overall performance and other events that have happened recently, those are things that really solidify people into where they are, right? They understand what the stakes are. And that sense of urgency is very high within this group. They're very capable people. So we've passed that first test. The second test is now the doing of the hard things. Right now, we've got to go do them. And that will be -- we're going to move very quickly, but you also have to move intentionally, right? You've got to be very smart about that. You've got to think about those strategies of how you win with customers, where you win with customers, and you need to invest very intentionally and ahead of the curve, so you make sure you're winning not hurting them, and we've got to do that and do that well. But I think this team is ready to do that. Philip Ng : Got you. And then do you have all the infrastructure in place, Andy to make some of these decisions where you need to put capital work and where you've over invested perhaps? Have you aligned KPIs in terms of sales force and the box managers be more aligned with reliability pricing, net promoter scores kind of stuff for customer engagement? Andy Silvernail : That's a great question. So I call it the scorecard, right? So one of the things that we've got to get better at here across the company is really having clarity of the metrics that drive results for our customers and drive results for our owners. And those things -- obviously, we've got tons of data. You can imagine our process environment, there's tons of data. But the data that really matters has got to stick out. So the basic stuff around safety, quality, on-time in full productivity and profitable growth. Those are the basic ones. I was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa last week, and the team does a great job there. It's an OCC mill that just does a phenomenal job. And they're probably a leader in terms of the linkage between what happens upstream in terms of our reliability capability, our production capabilities. You name it, you name the metric. And so they understand the levers. There also are probably first or second in the fleet and cost per ton, right? They're outstanding from that perspective. And so they really demonstrate they're kind of a great forerunner, so to speak, of what happens when you really measure cause and effect. So we are seeing that. Specifically commercially, right, as you think about the commercial side, moving incentives they're more tied to profitable growth versus volume is very important. -- Understanding, however, that you got to be competitive in the market, right? You've got to be competitive, you got to price to value, and that is very important, right? You've got to price where customers see your value. And we're getting better at understanding that. We've got room to go. We are significantly improving our sales talent across the business in terms of the number of people that we have and their capabilities. And we're seeing that pipeline grow because of that but you got to have clarity of metrics and incentives have to be tied to those metrics from the customer all the way through your production capability all the way through the supply chain. And that's something we've got work to do, and we're going to get better. Operator : Your final question comes from Matthew McKellar with RBC. Matthew McKellar : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Are you able to give any more specificity around the approximate time line to achieve that $4 billion EBITDA target maybe give us a sense of contribution from the Global Cellulose Fibers business that may be embedded in that target. And maybe with that, is there an updated view on whether that business is core to IP going forward? Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So in terms of timing, look, I apologize. We just -- as you can imagine, we wrestled with that question internally and we had to talk to lawyers and whatnot. But as we're involved with the DS Smith process, we can't, and if we do, it constitutes a forecast, and it triggers a whole bunch of messy things. So we have to be very, very careful of that. What I would say is that is a mid-cycle number. And it's not forever away, right? So we're not talking about 10 years away. It's not something like that. And so for those of you who know me, my track record is to move. And we're going to move, and that's going to be very, very important. Specifically, as we talk about GCF, let me talk about that more from the whole portfolio. We're looking at our whole portfolio, you have to, right? And you have to do it all the time. You don't do it once, you do it all the time you're reviewing your portfolio. And what I've said to folks is I started on May 1. And what I said out of the gate was we will not get to the May 1 and not have a decision. And I've said that to our people internally, have been very transparent that we got to go through a decision-making process, and we will make those decisions. Sooner is always better, right? It's always better to do those things. And so that would be my goal, sooner is better. And we have to follow a deliberate process. In terms of the magnitude, the impact of GCF on that overall number, it's very small, right? So there is no expectation that GCF is a giant proportion of that. And so we'll obviously be more detailed over time when we can be more detailed when we're allowed to be more detailed. And also, you're going to see some detail in the proxy. So the proxy is going to be filed in August. And the timing, I'm not exactly sure of, Tim. It's in August, that about right? Yes. So you're going to get more detail there. We'll have to -- we'll give more detail on the road show, what we can give, again, within the balance of what we can give. So between now and the third quarter earnings call, if you kind of bracket that time frame, so 90 days from now, we're going to give you a lot more detail here. Matthew McKellar : Great. Thanks very much for the help. I'll turn it back. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So look, I want to say thank you again to everybody. We've got important work to do. We're very much in the data analysis phase and building the implementation plans. I think it's important to note that we're going to make decisions based on facts, and we still have some data together, and that is going to point us towards how to get a bunch of these opportunities. It's very clear, however, how much opportunity is out there and the detailed work we've already done shows that. So we will get more specific. We will time bound it as we move between now and the end of the year. But I think the key thing that I would ask people to take away is that we have control of the vast majority of this. We have control of that. We can control our own destiny. Yes, things are going to move in the market. We can't control that. But we can control what we do. We can control how we approach understanding our business and where we apply our resources and focusing on the right customers, the right products and the right assets to drive really outstanding results over time. So with that, I want to thank everybody very much for your time, for your partnership, and I look forward to talking to you here over the next months as we move through this process. Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Nellessen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's third quarter earnings call. Our speakers' this morning are Andy Silvernail, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements can be found in our press releases and reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter earnings press release and today's presentation slides. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Hey. Thanks, Mark. Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 3. After my first six months in this seat, I'm encouraged by the pace of improvement and proud of the team for aggressively engaging in IP's transformation. We are building a performance-driven culture at IP that will enable us to create significant value for our employees, customers and share owners. That work begins with strong alignment around a very clear and compelling strategy. We will drive profitable growth by being the low cost producer and the most reliable and innovative sustainable packaging solutions provider in North America and EMEA. We are using our 80/20 approach to guide investments and align resources to win with our most attractive customers, reduce complexity and cost around the company and drive transformational performance. Ultimately, building great teams and a customer culture are foundational to our improvements. We are passionate about delivering superior experience to our best customers and best-in-class returns for our share owners. Let's turn to Slide 4. We are on our way to driving transformational changes at IP. We've conducted 80/20 training with our top leaders across the company and are actively deploying the methodology. We will continue to embed this practice with our commercial teams at the mills, at box plants, and with administrative functions. I was delighted that about 80% of our active investors joined us for the 80/20 overview session in August. Importantly, we are completing 80/20 segmentation across the company. We are looking at our portfolio and business segments, markets, customers, products, suppliers, and assets and facilities. We are completing zero up analysis to determine our key resource needs, and we are developing implementation plans and aligning resources to position our businesses to win for customers. We have fully entered the implementation phase by engaging our teams and taking actions to accelerate our strategy and significantly improve IP's performance. I'm now on Slide 5. I'll share some strategic actions we are taking in the fourth quarter to position IP for success. What all these actions have in common is that they give us greater focus on strategic customers and markets, align resources and investments to win and simplify all aspects of IP, which reduces complexity and costs. While we are confident that these actions are necessary, they include some difficult decisions that impact our team members, their families, and the surrounding communities. One of the great strengths of IP is our values. We make these decisions with care and compassion, ensuring that we treat people with dignity and respect while providing support, outplacement and severance to help people in their transition. Our actions at the enterprise level are centered on reducing complexity and shifting resources into the businesses and closer to the customer to accelerate strategy. This is the fundamental principle of 80/20. We are simplifying to enable greater focus and collaboration, improved execution, have more agility, improve the customer experience and lower cost. Within our North American Packaging business, we are investing for outstanding service, reliability, productivity, and enhanced capabilities to win with customers while optimizing our total system and reducing structural costs. As I mentioned on the Q2 call, we have two regional optimization pilots underway in our box system. We are reducing complexity and investing in equipment and people to improve safety, product quality, on-time delivery while lowering cost. Importantly, we are seeing a 20% to 30% productivity improvement in these early stages at these pilot areas. There is opportunity to apply this approach across our national box network. This will be a key lever for delivering profitable market share growth now and in the future. Recently, we announced five plant closures in regions where we have excess capacity and an opportunity to optimize our footprint, working closely with our customers to transition their business to other IP plans. We expect to retain 100% of our strategic customers and we are making investments in remaining facilities for future growth. Importantly, we have identified multiple opportunities for greenfield and brownfield box plant investments that will be industry-leading in all aspects of safety and performance. You should expect to see announcements and investments soon to increase our strength in strategic markets. After strategic review, we've decided to evaluate opportunities to better position GCF for long-term success. Our Board has authorized us to pursue strategic options. We have engaged Morgan Stanley as our advisor. GCF as a leader in fluff pulp is very well positioned in a growing global market. We have a talented team and a strong market position and great technical expertise. We have a highly advantaged mill system. And as I mentioned in our [indiscernible] a global supply position. Throughout the process, we are fully committed to support our business and committed to serving our customers. We will update investors when the process is completed. Regardless of if we sell or if we keep GCF, it will be positioned to win for the long-term. While we are engaging in this process, we'll continue to accelerate their strategy to focus on fluff and improve business performance. The decision to close the Georgetown mill allows us to exit about 300,000 tons of commodity SBSK and low value specialty grades across the system. This move significantly lower complexity and costs, improves returns, and reduces earnings volatility. We expect to retain 100% of our fluff grades and customers and increase our absorbent mix to about 80%. GCF will continue to have plenty of capacity for growth with key customers. These actions strengthen GCF, make them a stronger supplier of high-quality fluff pulp to the market and for our strategic customers. And again, regardless of the outcome, GCF has the potential to be an attractive business with meaningful upside potential. I'm now on Slide 6. This slide reflects some 80/20 early wins we are seeing across the company. Our teams are engaged. They've jumped in and they are not wasting any time. We are taking action to win with our customers, reduce complexity and improve performance. And here are just some examples I thought I'd call up \u2013 of all the great work that's happening with our teams. On safety, our intent is to set the industry standard as a great place to work starting because we are the safest place to work. We are using 80/20 analytics to understand opportunities for safety improvement that include better root cause analysis and advanced technology. Simply put, safety must be above everything else. I've already talked about the pilot plans in two regions where we are seeing double-digit productivity improvements. Also, the corporate reorganization will allow us to focus on our customers and business results. We are moving from a matrix organization to a customer-focused organization. Importantly, we've changed our sales incentive programs that are simpler and better aligned with our commercial strategy to drive profitable growth and reward those people who deliver. Another great example is a large strategic customer who we partnered with to look at their mix of business that was driving huge complexity. By working together, we reduced the complexity of their order patterns, which saves 1,300 hours to change over time and significantly improve service levels. These kind of examples can be found across the system for more opportunities in the future. We also had a couple of quick hit wins in sourcing in the U.S. and Europe where we were able to partner with strategic suppliers to approve costs and terms. There is more to come, but we are encouraged by the level of commitment and excitement across the company as we work to deliver safe, profitable growth. All right. I'm on Slide 7. There is good momentum in the company, but we are just starting our 80/20 journey and it needs to take hold to every part of the company. Ultimately, 80/20 is a powerful business model when it is lived not only in the C-suite, but with customers at paper machines and at shipping docks of box plants. Along with the progress at IP, we are very excited to complete the DS Smith acquisition. I'm sure you've all seen the strong shareholder support. We are bringing together two great organizations and building winning positions in the attractive markets of North America and Europe. We expect to close in the early first quarter upon completion of regulatory reviews. Our teams are actively involved in planning for the integration. I'm pleased to announce that after closing the transaction, Tim Nicholls will serve as the interim leader of the combined IP and DS Smith EMEA teams. In addition to his responsibilities as the CFO, we are fortunate to have outstanding finance teams at IP and DS Smith that enable us to do this. Finally, we are happy to announce that we will host an Investor Day on March 25th, 2025 at Freedom Hall at the New York Stock Exchange. This will be an opportunity for us to share details about our strategy and value creation opportunities across the company. Now let me turn to the third quarter performance and the outlook. First, I'll share some highlights and then turn it to Tim, who will walk us through the details. I'm on Slide 9. Our third quarter earnings came in above our outlook for the quarter. Better performance was driven by strong price improvements across the portfolio. This included about $17 million of benefit from our Box Go-to-Market strategy. Volumes were seasonally lower as expected. Operating costs were higher sequentially due to lower volumes, seasonally higher labor costs, employee incentive compensation, and some reliability issues at our mill system, which Tim will address as he covers the business segment performance. In terms of the underlying market, we continue to see stable to moderately improving demand and trends in North America across the various segments we serve. In Europe, we have seen some softening however. As expected, IP's packaging volumes lag the overall market as we restructured commercial agreements to improve overall profitability. Relative to prior year performance, we've had higher sales revenues to offset the higher costs, primarily related to inflation, employee incentive compensation, as well as some reliability issues and spending to improve future performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are laser focused on reducing structural costs across the company and we are taking actions. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect higher earnings across our packaging business as our price increases from the prior index movement stick. We also expect lower costs from improved operations and lower planned maintenance outages. We expect lower earnings in GCF as a result of prior price index declines and higher planned maintenance outages. In the fourth quarter, we are also calling out significant accelerated depreciation expenses associated with the facility closures that I mentioned earlier. With that, let me turn over to Tim, who will provide more details about our third quarter performance and our outlook. Timothy Nicholls : Great. Thanks, Andy. Now turning to Slide 10, I'll provide more details about the third quarter as we walk through the sequential earnings bridge. Third quarter adjusted operating earnings per share was $0.44 as compared to $0.55 in the second quarter. Price and mix was higher by $0.29 per share driven by the flow through of prior price index movements in both businesses. Higher export prices as well as margin benefits from successfully executing our Box Go-to-Market strategy. Volume was unfavorable by $0.12 per share due to the seasonally lower box shipments and some volume trade offs related to commercial contract restructuring actions. Although we continue to see favorable demand trends deploying our commercial strategies across the portfolio continues to impact volumes in the near-term as expected. Operations and costs was unfavorable by $0.28 per share sequentially. This is largely from the impact of lower volumes, seasonally higher labor costs, higher employee incentive compensation, some reliability incidents and spending, and some weather impacts. Maintenance outages were higher by $14 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter, and inputs were unfavorable sequentially with higher costs for energy and wood. And finally, corporate items were favorably impacted earnings by $0.08 per share sequentially due to the timing of corporate items and a lower effective tax rate. If we turn to Slide 11, I'll cover industrial packaging. Price and mix was higher due to the realization of approximately $70 million of benefit from the prior index movement. Additional benefits from our Box Go-to-Market strategy contributed approximately $17 million to earnings and higher exports contributed to approximately $18 million. Volume was lower by $48 million sequentially due to seasonality and one less shipping day in the third quarter. In addition, we made choices based on our Box Go-to-Market strategy that will negatively impact our volume in the near-term, but will allow us to improve our margins and mix over the longer term. Operations and costs was $89 million unfavorable sequentially, primarily due to lower volumes, seasonally higher labor costs and higher employee incentive compensation. Ops and costs also includes a $42 million unfavorable impact from reliability incidents that occurred at a few mills, partially offset by $20 million of insurance proceeds for the Ixtac box plant fire that occurred earlier this year. Planned maintenance outages were higher by $38 million sequentially, and input costs were $24 million unfavorable, primarily due to the higher energy and wood costs. If we turn to Slide 12 and covering GCF, price and mix was sequentially higher by $24 million due to price index movements. Volume sequentially was lower by $4 million. Operations and costs were unfavorable sequentially by $35 million, which includes an $18 million unfavorable impact from reliability incidents at a few of our mills in addition to other items, including higher employee incentive compensation. Planned maintenance outages were lower in the third quarter by $24 million. And finally, input costs were flat with lower energy and chemical costs, offsetting higher wood costs. I'm on Slide 13 now, and before we get into the details of the outlook, I would note that accelerated depreciation expense will be a significant impact in the fourth quarter due to previously announced facility closures so we've called that out for each business. And in line with guidance from the SEC, accelerated depreciation will be included in operating earnings. Earnings for our Industrial Packaging segment are expected to be higher sequentially by approximately $55 million, which includes accelerated depreciation expense of $15 million. Earnings for Global Cellulose Fibers are expected to be lower sequentially by approximately $275 million, which includes accelerated depreciation expense of $220 million, as well as higher planned maintenance outages. Now let me give you the breakdown by business segment. I'll start with industrial packaging. We expect price and mix to improve earnings by $45 million sequentially. This is primarily the result of prior index movement in North America with some benefit from previous actions under our Box Go-to-Market strategy. The sequential improvement also includes favorable mix in our EMEA packaging business given the strong fresh food and vegetable season in Morocco. Volume is expected to decrease earnings by $15 million due to two last shipping days, partially offset by seasonally higher daily demand. We expect operations and costs to increase earnings by $5 million. This includes improved performance and reliability, which are partially offset by higher seasonal costs and the non-repeat of insurance proceeds received in the third quarter. We expect accelerated depreciation will decrease earnings for the packaging business by approximately $15 million due to the five packaging facility closures in the fourth quarter. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $21 million. And lastly, lower input costs are expected to increase earnings by $15 million, primarily due to lower OCC and wood cost. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers. We expect price and mix to decrease earnings by approximately $25 million as a result of prior index movement. Volume is expected to be stable. We expect operations and costs to increase earnings by approximately $5 million due to improved performance and reliability, which is partially offset by higher seasonal and distribution costs. We expect accelerated depreciation will decrease earnings for the Pulp business by approximately $220 million due to the closure of the Georgetown mill in the fourth quarter. Higher planned maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease earnings in the fourth quarter by approximately $36 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to be stable. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Tim. We'll now turn to Slide 14. Again, look, we are making great progress and we are well on our way to building a performance-driven and customer-centric culture. And we are taking actions. We are taking actions to control our own destiny, and we are making the right choices to accelerate performance improvement. I'm confident that we have the right strategy and a talented team and a concrete plan to create a great place to work, deliver customer excellence and drive profitable growth. Our actions will drive transformational improvements at IP and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. Andy, it's been really inspirational in terms of the progress you guys have made in this short time. So really exciting. As you kind of look at the mix of customers that you're looking to optimize, how is that progress coming along? I know you've realigned your sales incentive comp structure for a lot of your employees, are you seeing any early findings, change of behavior? And if I look at Tim's forecast for box shipments sequentially in the U.S., it looked okay. It didn't seem like there was any more incremental leakage there. So give us an update on how that contract negotiation is progressing? Are you seeing any more incremental churn on the customer side? Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Phil. Appreciate the question. So look, first of all, let me just recognize the teams for having done a tremendous job. We do a morning call in advance of earnings, and we were able to talk to a bunch of the folks here today and just recognize the incredibly hard work that the people have done over the last six months to create momentum. So I personally, I just recognize that the monumental work that's been accomplished. Specific to your question on volume, what we're seeing there is, it feels like it's the leakage has slowed. And I don't want to jump the gun here and say, gone because we still will have year-over-year volume down here for the next few quarters. But we do expect that we get to the back half of next year, we expect to turn that and we expect it to be at least back to market growth. And so what I would say we're seeing right now is the expected losses. So if we kind of look at the band of volume losses, we are better than the bottom end of those \u2013 of that range of expectations, which is positive. We have also gotten much, much sharper through the 80/20 work of getting clear about what segments of the market are priorities for us. And if I were to simplify that film, I'd say, look, if you \u2013 let's just use the U.S. market. So the U.S. market is about 400 billion square feet of \u2013 from a packaging standpoint. And there's about 60% that I put in the big middle. So 20% is on one end, which tends to be smaller local customers. And on the other end, it tends to be very price-sensitive larger customers. Frankly, the sweet spot for us is that big middle, right? That is where we are really, really good. Obviously, we do business across the spectrum, given our market position. And frankly, if we can do business with folks on good terms and conditions, we're open for business. But our focus is really on those people who match our strategy. And our strategy is very much again about we're going to be the low-cost producer. We're not going to be the low-price player, but we're going to be the low-cost producer. We are going to be great on service, and we are going to invest where we have strength and the customers that really match that in that big middle is the sweet spot for us, and we really like that overall positioning. In terms of the further segmentation, that really starts to become regional and then super local. And it's one of the things I love about this business is, as I talked about when I first thought about joining the company, what was ringing in my head was commodity, commodity, commodity. And that's not the case, right? We have a highly differentiated position and can have a highly differentiated position in our marketplace. So I feel good about the segmentation. I feel good about the focus. As we've been rolling out 80/20 training regionally, we've now done three regional commercial training, and we've identified big chunks of opportunity that are out there in the marketplace that where our value proposition is highly aligned with what the customer wants. So I feel good that we're heading in the right direction. It's too early to call a turn. But I do think that the leakage has certainly slowed. Philip Ng : Okay. Super. And then you talked about a few things, early wins in terms of the pilot program on the box side to kind of unlock more efficiency, your ability to kind of ramp that more broadly and then also, you highlighted a large customer where you're able to kind of reduce the complexity and really reduce the changeover. That's pretty exciting. So your ability to kind of roll that out more broadly as well. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I think, Phil, both those two things, those are really nuanced, but I can't stress how important those examples are as you think about rolling those out across the company. So you think about the box plant pilots, fundamentally, what's happening, let's just use a simple \u2013 you're in a region and you have two box plants. And one effectively becomes a low mix, high volume plant and the other becomes a high mix plant. And there can be a tendency for some to say, \"Oh, well, we've now stratified our plant. No, what we've done is we specialized our plants. And so the one that's dealing with high volume, they can capitalize, build their labor force and build their entire plan around a certain business model that drives tremendous efficiency aligned with what the customer needs. And then the high mix plant can get greater changeovers, right? They can get greater changeovers, even the equipment can be different when you start thinking about what you're talking about there. So the entire capitalization the workflow, those things can be different. And so we can't do that everywhere in the country. But we've got 20, 25 regions that I would expect would call them regions. And within that, probably at least half of those have the dynamics that we're talking about. And so we can look at that \u2013 those kind of options. So that's exciting. And don't forget what comes in that is really important. So we closed five plants, but someone could look at that and say, \"Hey, you're taking capacity out of the system. That's a problem. Well, those are plants that were underutilized, we can move 100% of the customer to some place that we have capacity. And as we grow our overall capacity in the system by driving productivity, we open up service levels. And then put on that, the greenfields and the brownfields that we're looking at. And we'll get more specific in the future and probably after the fourth quarter call, we'll talk more about capital planning and we can talk about what that means incrementally for capital. And I've said that as long as our strategy is going in the right direction, we're not going to be scared about investing. And to look at these greenfields, we look at these brownfields to really drive productivity and hopefully, productivity for our customers rather again and growth for our customers. Relative to that one change over example, what I love about that, right, is it's a total win-win to working with a customer who service levels aren't quite what they want. They've gotten really demanding about a very specific business model, not a specific outcome. And we're able to partner with them and say, \"Hey, what do you need? And what they want is rapid on-time delivery, even same day, right? Even kind of down the street show up, we order it by two and it's getting there by four. That kind of stuff. Well, that's really hard to do when you have order patterns that are moving all around. And if you think about that, if you're trying to have that kind of delivery response to a customer, you either have to have inventory on hand or you have to be able to produce just in time. You got to be able to have one of the two. And what we're trying to do is find that balance where we can meet that customer demand, but also drive down our capital needs and our costs, and we've found that great win-win. I mean if you think about that, that's one customer, one facility or maybe two facilities, 1,300 hours of change over time. That's a big, big, big number when you think about how that impacts us. Philip Ng : Okay. These are all great examples. Appreciate the color, Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Roxland : Yes. Thank you, Andy, Tim, Mark, for taking my questions. Great quarter. Obviously you've all been slightly busy. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Michael Roxland : I wanted to follow-up on Phil\u2019s question regarding the 20% to 30% productivity improvement. Can you talk about what that means for EBITDA on average at those box plants? And in terms of deploying this methodology at the box plants, over what timeframe do you see this rolling out? And lastly, is this something that you can apply to your mill system as well? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Great questions, Michael. So if I were you, I wouldn't focus on EBITDA by box plant. I don't think that's the great \u2013 that's the right measure. Because what you're really looking for out of your box plants is great customer service and a low-cost position while doing that. And so if we can move that from box plant to box plant within a region like I was talking about before, you want to have that kind of flexibility. The way that I would think about the math and all of this, and this kind of goes to your second part of your question, which is a mill is if you create a unit of productivity in our business, right? So if you create a true productivity, meaning I can put another dollar of production over our fixed cost base, right? That's the way to think of it. When you do that, you drive on a contribution level, 60-plus percent incremental margins if you're able to drive productivity. It's huge, right? In my old world, you'd get 30% to 35% and now we're not going to put 60% or 65% in a pocket. Don't get me wrong because we're going to reinvest back in the business, and that's where the magic starts to happen. That's the virtuous cycle starts to kick in. But if you think of it, let's go box plant and then let's talk mill. On the box plant side, as you do this, again, what it does is it creates local flexibility for great customer service, it lowers your cost structure and it allows you to grow, right? That's what these things ultimately allow you to do. And then also, it lowers your capital intensity needs, right? So you're improving profitability, you're improving customer service, you're lowering capital intensity. So your ROIC is just outstanding. And the answer to your question is yes, you can do that in the mill system. It's different, right? It's a different thing, but philosophically, it's the same. So let's just think about \u2013 let's use an example of a winder. So you're making paper, you're at the winder. For us, winders are the most dangerous place in the company, and they also tend to be bottlenecks, right? And so what that means is your people are interacting \u2013 having to interact with the most dangerous place in your operations. So you start doing the analytics, you're focusing on what the bottlenecks are, you're focusing on the people interactions you're introducing technology. One of the things that we're working on right now is optical technology that will actually shut down machines any time a human gets to a dangerous place, right? So we're starting to beta to test that in certain mills. And like anyone goes to an Amazon Go, look, the technology is out there and just how do you put that into an industrial environment. So you can absolutely do that with mills and box plants. Very importantly, in 2025, we are going to create some, what I'm going to call lighthouses, and we're going to use a process called strategy deployment. Those of you who are familiar with the Danaher or the Toyota Production System, if you think of Hoshin Planning or Danaher, we call it policy deployment, it's a very disciplined methodology of deploying strategy. So for us, we're going to focus on safety. We're going to focus on 80/20 and the integration of DS Smith. Those are going to be the things that we deploy next year. In that deployment, there will be a handful of what I call lighthouses, where you're trying to create best-in-class examples of the strategy that we're trying to employ. So we're going to take these two pilots that we're using in the two regions of the country. Those will continue and there will be box plant lighthouses. We're going to take two different mills, right? We're going to take an integrated mill and a nonintegrated mill, and they are going to become lighthouses in that strategy deployment. And then we'll do so also with a couple of commercial teams. So you get to the end of 2025 and what you have is examples of how we should do it and do it with true best. So my experience has been when you try to do things kind of at all the same levels across the entire enterprise of 40,000 people, soon to be 70,000 people with DS Smith, you don't get anywhere. You get kind of a mile wide and inch deep. And what we want to do is we want to get a mile deep and then demonstrate great results and then drive that out to different parts of the organization. Michael Roxland : Got it. I appreciate the color. Obviously, has got a tremendous amount of work ahead, but the trajectory seems very positive. Andrew Silvernail : And Michael, real quick. One of the things you guys are going to see also, so March 25, when we have the Investor Day, we'll definitely spend a bunch of time on these lighthouses, right? So we'll spend time on the lighthouses. We'll spend time on the DS Smith integration. So you'll get to see firsthand kind of how these things are working in practice. Sorry, Mike, we had another question? Michael Roxland : No, this is \u2013 and this is great. One quick follow-up. In terms of the potential for additional portfolio optimization, obviously, the company closed a mill in Orange earlier this year. I think at a recent conference, you mentioned trying to analyze where the company is overcapacitized. Where does that analysis stand right now? And what's the potential for further portfolio rightsizing at the mill level? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Great question. So again, we talked about this in the second quarter. We've got to be careful here. In those conversations for lots of different reasons, not least of which of course is to vitalizing the DS Smith acquisition, right? We're going through regulatory approvals. So we're being careful there. I think what's fair to say is we are looking at this stuff throughout the entire portfolio. And we're looking at sub segments of business that look like say the SBSK example within GCF, right, which is more commoditized products that have lots of capital intensity. Those are \u2013 and high earnings volatility. Those are places that, frankly, aren't good business for us. What you're going to see for us is a constant march \u2013 some of you have read the Jim Collins book, in a 20-mile march down the path of how do we become a more integrated business with less volatility. One of the things that's been, I think, just a wonderful thing for people to understand here is our core packaging business isn't very volatile. When you actually look at the demand patterns are not very volatile, we induce a lot of volatility into that business, and therefore, uncertainty and being on your side of the table, right, that volatility uncertainty, you're going to value it lower. I mean you just \u2013 that's just going to be what you do. And I would do. And I think as we go forward, what you're going to see us do is look across our portfolio as the kind of businesses integrated high-value businesses that we want to be in, and you'll see us deemphasize things that are not that. Michael Roxland : All right. Thanks very much and good luck in the quarter and in 2025. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Congrats on all the progress so far. So your sort of big picture, $2 billion or $4 billion, you talked about $1 billion from cost and ops, if I'm remembering correctly. And we certainly see some of the actions now being laid out, the strategic. Now you're 230, which I don't know, I assume that would be something you'd consider on that $1 billion. And then I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit is, particularly as I'm thinking about even 2025, but obviously beyond that, too. If I have this base of, let's say, a $2 billion run rate entering into the year. And then I can layer in the strategic actions you've identified \u2013 how much more from what you're doing 80/20 wise could potentially flow in 2025 and then beyond above and beyond, say, labor and benefits or something that you would be the typical offset. I realize that's a mouthful I just through there, but hopefully, you understand that direct. Andrew Silvernail : Mark, let me just \u2013 let me make sure I understand what you're asking. Are you asking kind of what the benefits could be in 2025 over above inflation? Is that what I'm trying \u2013 is that what you're asking? Mark Weintraub : At the heart of it, yes. Andrew Silvernail : Okay. Okay. The way that I look at this right is the numbers that I talk about are net numbers, right? So \u2013 and I think, by the way, Mark, I think it will be more like a 60-40 split of cost versus commercial. And hopefully, that's something that there's a lot more near-term control of that. And I do think it's a multiyear journey, right? So it's not going to all happen in 2025. Obviously, we want to pull as much forward as we can. I had the wonderful opportunity very early in my career to work for a gentleman by name of George Sherman, and George was the first CEO of Danaher. The Rales Brothers they started to build that business. They brought George in. And I had the privilege of being an intern and sitting across from his office and what an awesome opportunity. One of the things that George would say is get ahead right, get ahead. And so what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to get ahead. We're trying to get ahead of getting our cost base right. And frankly, while it's great to improve the cost structure and the profitability guys to be candid with you, that's a benefit right now. What that gives us is the ability to invest back in the business and we need to invest back in the business. And so we're going to do two things at once. So Mark, I apologize I've not being as specific as I'm sure you'd like, but we're going to try to pull as much forward as we can into 2025. We'll be responsible organizations, look they are like the human body. When you don't exercise them, they get flabby and they start to fall apart. At the same time, when you're trying to get fit, you can't just go run a marathon tomorrow, right? You have to work yourself into it. And we're running hard today, but we're trying to do it was by dividing and conquering, having different people and different parts of the organization focused on different things, so we can run this marathon. We can really run this marathon. And so we'll move as quickly as we can, but not so that we are irresponsible. Mark Weintraub : I appreciate that. Is it conceptually fair to say though that the benefits from 80/20 even in the earlier stages, like in 2025, should outdistance inflation and provide [indiscernible]. Andrew Silvernail : Sorry. I'm sorry, Mark. Yes, absolutely, right. We should \u2013 my expectation is that the cost and inflation equation will be positive at 2025. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Super. Thank you very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew McKellar with RBC. Please go ahead. Matthew McKellar : Thanks. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Matthew McKellar : If you could comment, does this concept of regional box plant specialization that you talked about on this call already exist across the DS Smith box plant system? Or how would you characterize the opportunity to bring this approach to their system as well? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I mean look, DS Smith is \u2013 they are a terrific company, and they've done some things really, really, really well that, frankly, better than us. They are better than IP commercially. There's no doubt about it. And so I think they are further ahead of us in some regards commercially \u2013 there's no doubt. But yes, there will be opportunities. I think you probably have fewer proportionally probably fewer density plays in Europe than you have in the U.S. I think that's probably true. You have fewer than that. And part of that is due to country boundaries. Even though you theoretically have a union in practice, how it works. It doesn't work like that. And so you have uniqueness in Europe around country boundaries that will be different. That being said, the segmentation insights, the ability to think about how we focus on our most important customers, what we call our 80s is absolutely going to be there, the ability to improve productivity is going to be there. And obviously, we've called out a bunch of that in the synergies that we've outlined, right? So we've outlined $514 million of synergies, 500 of which are cost and we think there's potentially upside from there. But again, we want to be responsible and we want to be able to deliver and get ahead there. So yes, there will be opportunities, but it will be different. DS Smith is in a different place than IP. And that doesn't mean always a better place, but some things are clearly better. Commercial, they are clearly better. They already have a decentralized corporate structure, which actually frankly makes it easier. I mean one of the big reasons for moving so quickly with the decentralization of the corporate structure in Memphis \u2013 isn't for the cost benefits. I mean, yes, there are some cost benefits. But what it allows you to do is it allows the organization to focus on the right things, price of businesses become highly focused on the customer, not on managing the matrix. DS Smith, they've already done that. That's a great thing. So what that means is we can kind of get to the fun, which is around customers and products and growth. And so there's lots of 80/20 insights that we'll have there, but it's going to be a fundamentally different path. Matthew McKellar : Great. Thanks for all that helpful color. And then just one quick one on GCF. As part of your review of strategic options there, are you evaluating options other than the sale and then in the case of the sale, how do you thinking about an appropriate value for that business? And then just any color around timeline to reach completion of your process? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I understand why you're asking those questions, some of it is pretty tough. I mean yes, we evaluate other options. We will evaluate kind of every option, frankly. I think the most likely option is a sale. That's the most likely option. There are certainly interested parties. We've had a lot of people who have reached out to us and have expressed interest. We think the process will be very robust. We have no doubt about that. In terms of value, I'm not going to speculate on value because I don't want to negotiate against myself. And \u2013 but very importantly, right, and I want to \u2013 I think this is important because more than just investors listen to these calls, right? One of the things that has impressed me this is a good business, right? One of the things that people have failed to understand here or failed to recognize, and I don't mean recognize meaning you didn't see something that wasn't true, meaning we didn't make itself is that this is a good business. We've got a 35% supply position in a highly valued global commodity. Our customers, specifically on the fluff side, our customers absolutely trust us to provide them with the best absorbed products, right? They absolutely trust us to do so. And we have a great team and great assets that make that so. So whether we own it or somebody else owns it, the performance of that business is going to be meaningfully different than what it's been. Matthew McKellar : Thanks very much. I will turn it back. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Muir-Sands with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Charlie Muir-Sands: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is just staying with the Global Cellulose Fibers business. Now that sale is very much potential auction. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how much of the uplift in group EBITDA to $4 billion in the targets you had anticipated coming from that is also a meaningful part of the $230 million EBITDA opportunity to identify so far? And then sorry, bundling into that $230 million. Is the 20, I think it was $25 million from procurement within that number as well? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : I don't think I've got \u2013 make sure I captured it right. So relative to GCF, it's a pretty small part of the kind of the getting to $4 billion. It's a relatively small part of that. So \u2013 and relative to the trade-offs of the capital that we'd expected to bring in, I don't think that, that would meaningfully impact our point of view. So that would be my perspective there. The procurement savings, no, those are not part of that. Those are two great wins that, frankly, what I love about 80/20 is once you kind of provide people with the insights and give them the guidance to go they start digging and the procurement team here, specifically on caustic had a couple of great opportunities where we were able to partner with suppliers. And look, this isn't about beating down suppliers. I actually think that's a really stupid strategy. I think what you're trying to do is you're trying to partner with suppliers. You're trying to find win-wins just like we did with our customers on changeovers, where you're getting better service, better terms, and they get to profitably grow with for those who can really play ball and so you're trying to create those partnerships. So those two examples, one in the U.S., one in Europe, no they were not included in the 230. Charlie Muir-Sands: Very clear. And just returning to the 20% to 30% productivity improvement, you've talked about achieving in the pilots. Can you just clarify what that actually means? Is that 20% to 30% lower total variable costs, including or excluding raw materials or yes, how are you measuring that? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. The simple way to think of it is in this example is think of it as square feet per unit. I mean, that's kind of the way to think of it. So it's output over a fixed base. And then from there, you have choices, right? So you can either grow and that's the ideal thing, right? You're going to grow faster and you're going to drop through at very, very high levels of contribution margin. It could allow you to consolidate other facilities into certain facilities. So in our case, we kind of have two different stories. If you look in the U.S., you've got parts in the U.S. that are, frankly, they're overutilized, right? There's demand that can't be satisfied and so we're trying to aggressively free capacity up to do that. And then you have parts of the country that have too much capacity and you need to take capacity out. So the five plants that we closed so far have been about being in parts of the country that have too much capacity. And so you get very specific fixed cost savings as the volume from those plants that existing moves to other facilities. But the real objective, right, is to free capacity for growth and recognize much higher variable contribution margins. Charlie Muir-Sands: So some of the five plant closures are kind of tied in to the pilots and therefore, that's the [indiscernible] Andrew Silvernail : Yes. That has not been the case so far, but we'll certainly see opportunities as time goes on. So you'll see a mix of that as we go forward. Charlie Muir-Sands: Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Charlie. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Gabe Hajde : Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Gabe Hajde : Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask, Andy, a little bit of what you started to address here in the last question, which is you're talking about freeing up maybe some capacity in certain parts of the system. And maybe the question is like \u2013 how much of what you're seeing across your converting system is more about increasing productivity. I think about it maybe per employee basis, the square foot per employee or something like that, you talked about variable costs versus freeing up capacity because when we look across what's been added from other players, it doesn't seem like there's a shortage of converting capacity in the marketplace. So it seems a little circular to free up capacity. So how do you think about that balance? Or maybe again, like you said, quantify for us, oh, this many plants we see is there's cost savings and productivity on the cost side, and here is where we have a bottleneck issue? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So you're touching on something that's very, very important. And one of the conundrum, when you look at it at the highest level. So when you look at converting capacity on the highest level, you're absolutely right. There is not a shortage of converting capacity in the United States. However, region by region, that is not true, right? So as you look region by region, you have places that have way too much capacity and you have places that do not have enough. And one of the mistakes that we have made over time is we have not made the tough choices and then the aggressive choice is about finding that right balance. So taking capacity out of places where we shouldn't have it and then investing aggressively in places that we should have it. I think that's what we're trying to do is, we're trying to find that right balance. And really look very importantly, the places that we have real strength in a really differentiated position, we need to play ball there, right? We've got to play, and we've kind of play to win in the places that we're a little bit on our heels. We got to retrench, and we got a sub-segment. We got to get to places where we can win. And so we've got to be very thoughtful. I mean this \u2013 again, one of the most exciting things about this business in the U.S. and in Europe is that this is a local business. I mean, this is a very, very local business, which actually, it ended up looking a lot more like what I had [indiscernible], right, which is you can be highly decentralized. You can build strategies that are around working with local customers because \u2013 when you think about how local the businesses is that the overlay of that is there tend to be very specific market segments that are in those locations, right. There's general market segments and then there's specific market segments. And the performance requirements of those market segments are different. And so while the general strategies are the same, when you think about low cost position, when you think about service excellence, when you think about investing in strength locally, how that is actually executed based on the needs of the market is very different. And we should be different. We should allow our people to be entrepreneurial and allow them to drive that differentiation in the market, but then allow IP and therefore, competitively to have a huge advantage because of our scale and our scope. Gabe Hajde : Thank you. You talked a lot about early wins and stuff you're encouraged by and maybe this is just the \u2013 I'm always cautious or I mean that way. Are there examples or things when you've walked across the organization and have been meeting with \u2013 looking at assets and things like that where I don't want to say you stub your toe, but it brought more of your attention or things that could trip us up. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. There are a few things that I look at that I know we've got \u2013 they are potential bottlenecks or roadblocks to success. I think that's what you're getting. So again, one of the reasons of the early focus on Memphis and this is no one's fault. To be clear, the people who live and work here in Memphis are working their tails off and they're doing exactly what they're being asked to do and they're trying to do it with excellence. But the bottom line is we created a matrix structure that's really, really, really hard to work through, right? That's what we have. It makes it very complicated. It makes it difficult to understand what the priorities are and who your boss is. And at the end of the day, the boss is the customer, right? The customer is the boss. And we need to be aligned to the customer, not to the CEO, not to the Board of Directors, not to you folks the investor, sorry, but it's to customers. And we needed to be aligned there, and we weren't. And so the reason for the early focus around that is working through that. The reason I mention this is that I am not a [indiscernible] here, just because we've made the announcements and we've made the structural changes people are used to decades of work, right? And there's a lot of institutional memory. We have to change how we actually work. And that is a potential stumbling block is that we don't change how we work. That's one of the reasons of bringing the strategy deployment process in and deploying 80/20. So every single function. And I'll give a goofy example of this, our earnings prep, right? So we 80/20 our earnings prep. I can't even estimate how much time we took out of [indiscernible] 50%, 60%. Just of the prep because, frankly, guys, we were trying to answer every potential question it could ever come out of anything you would ever ask. Well, we're not going to \u2013 and so let's get to the 80%. Let's get to the things that really matter. We know the general questions you guys are going to work on, and let's get the answers to that with excellence. And I know that sounds like a goofy example, but the downstream work that gets caused by stuff like that, things like how we do capital, things like how we do budgets. Those things matter. And so we have to change how those things happen. And let's remember, four weeks ago, there were 2,600 people who you would define is working in the corporate center. That's what you have defined as a corporate center. Today, it's 226, right? That doesn't mean all those people went away. That is not what happened, right? You saw the number of people that we announced that are leaving the organization. And again, we're doing everything to make sure that those folks land in a good place on their feet. But the reality is that we don't need 2,600 people in the center. We need 226 at the center because we get to zero up, and that's what we need to be excellent at the functions of running a corporate \u2013 public corporate company. Everybody else is in the business. So everybody else is now aligned with the boss and the boss is the customer. Gabe Hajde : Thank you for that. Andrew Silvernail : Awesome. Operator : And I will now turn the call back over to Andy Silvernail for any closing comments. Andrew Silvernail : Well, I want to thank all of you for taking your time and spending time listening today to our journey. Again, just a tremendous amount of work that has gone in, in the last six months. I'm incredibly proud of this team for all they've done. Also, let's remember that organizations are made of people. And the things that we're doing are tough. We are having to do the tough stuff so we can get to the good stuff. That means that people are impacted. And I'm really mindful about that. And we are going to move with pace. We are going to move with excellence. We are going to do the right things. And even though it's difficult, we are doing the right things and we're doing the right things because the goal is to build a great organization that delivers for our customers. It delivers for our owners. And when that happens, we deliver for our people. And so as we move through this and turn this into something very special, we're going to do it through our people and I'm proud to be part of this team. I'm proud of what we have here, and I feel great about the direction we're heading. So thank you very much. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in International Paper's third quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jose Maria Rodriguez Meis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Jose Maria Rodriguez Meis : Thank you, Krista. Good morning and good afternoon, and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Andy Silvernail, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and stepping in today for our Chief Financial Officer, Tim Nicholls, who is in London for DS Smith day 1, is Finance Vice President, Mark Nellessen. There is important information at the beginning of our presentation, including certain legal disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward-looking statements can be found in our press releases and reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year earnings press release and today's presentation slides. And finally, I would like to note that all financial materials in this presentation reflect only the current IP portfolio. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Jose, and congratulations on your new role as Vice President of Investor Relations. And congratulations to Mark Nellessen, who's moving from IR to the lead finance role in our North American packaging solutions business. And Mark, thanks for pitching in for Tim as he's getting us ready here for day 1 with DS Smith. With that, good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm going to begin on Slide 3. I'm excited to share that today, DS Smith appeared before the court in the U.K. to get final approval, and we officially expect to close the DS Smith transaction at the end of the day tomorrow, U.S. time, Friday, January 31. As you know, last week, the competition authorities of the European Commission approved the proposed acquisition of DS Smith by International Paper with conditions. The EC identified minimal concerns about the acquisition's impact on competition in certain areas. To resolve those concerns, we have agreed to divest 5 box plants in Northern France, Northern Spain and Portugal within the next 6 months. We would have preferred to retain all facilities in the IP family, and we truly appreciate the contributions for the team and the team members of these 5 plants. We're committed to identifying suitable buyers who can offer a viable future for these teams. Each of these locations is attractive, and we expect significant interest from potential buyers. I'm looking forward to welcoming DS Smith to IP on Monday, February 3. Together with our customers, we're creating the global leader in sustainable packaging solutions, and we're focused on the attractive and growing markets in North America and EMEA. I'm excited about the potential to unlock value for our stakeholders. We'll do a deep dive on the path forward for DS Smith at our Investor Day in March. Now transitioning to Slide 4. We are building a performance-driven customer-centric culture at IP to fulfill our purpose, a culture that will enable us to create significant value for our employees, customers and shareholders. That work begins with a strong alignment around a very clear and compelling strategy and that strategy stems from our mission and our values of safety, ethics and excellence. Most importantly, our teams will put safety above all else. We will drive profitable market share growth by being the low-cost producer and the most reliable and innovative sustainable packaging provider in North America to EMEA. A disciplined 80/20 mindset will permeate everything we do. By focusing on the critical few, we are aligning resources, reducing complexity, removing costs and delighting customers. These efforts are all focused to deliver superior value for all of our stakeholders. I'm now moving to Slide 5. We're making progress and taking actions on our path to achieve $4 billion of EBITDA medium term. This does not include the DS Smith base earnings or synergies. Again, we're going to talk about those things in detail at our Investor Day in March. As I've shared in the past, roughly $1.2 billion of the improvement that we are targeting is going to come from cost out. This number is net of inflation. So the way to think about it is that we have to take out roughly $1.6 billion of cost. As we talked about on the third quarter call, we started to do the heavy lifting, so we're making the right choices to take cost out of the system. Those impacts will ramp up through the year with actions already announced and more to come. We've zeroed up the corporate organization, we're aligning resources to the businesses, and we're having a lean, effective and efficient corporate staff. As a result, we expect our costs will be reduced by $120 million annually. We have taken the difficult actions to close 5 box plants in our Global Cellulose Fibers mill in Georgetown, we estimate that these combined will remove roughly another $110 million of cost from our run rate. As I mentioned last quarter, our other -- there are 2 regions where we're doing 80/20 pilots. We're now calling these lighthouses. We have delivered 20% plus productivity gains, and we will scale that optimization method to another 22 box plants in 2025. As we look into 2025 and beyond, we'll continue to be laser-focused on improving reliability at our mills and optimizing our mill and box systems, so we deliver structural cost reduction. In 2024, our operating performance and lack of productivity cost us $350 million. Unlocking this performance will free resources, allow us to optimize our overall structure and drive profitable growth. We are also speeding up capital investment opportunities that we believe will deliver significant cost reduction. And to that extent, we have initiated a complete overhaul of our capital investment process to simplify and significantly reduce from -- time from idea to execution. If we turn to the commercial improvements, we expect these commercial improvements to contribute roughly $800 million to our $4 billion target. Our go-to-market value over volume reset is essentially complete. We expect the final unfavorable impact to volume to be behind us later this year. Volume has tracked to our plan for the past 3 quarters and since we started looking at January, and we have a clear pipeline forward. We have developed a new compensation plan for our sales force to better align incentives to strategy. This plan will also support our goal of attracting and retaining the best commercial talent in the industry. We continue to add new sales associates as we enhance our commercial capabilities and move to a customer-centric culture. This renewed focus on customer experience has already resulted in significant quality and on-time delivery improvements in our packaging business, which is validated by both internal and external data. This is true in general across the overall business and specifically at our 80/20 lighthouses. We also have an ambitious pipeline of capital projects to both facilitate the regional optimization of our box system and deliver profitable market share growth. And I'll share an example here on the coming slides. Before we move on, let me say that I'm proud of our team and the solid progress we're making. We have a lot of work to do. There's absolutely no doubt about that, but the fundamentals are in place for our performance-driven customer-centric culture and those things starting to show. We have the right strategy and execution road map. Now comes the hard part, and it will not be linear. We need to demonstrate the ability to execute with excellence. Our success and our destiny lie in our control. Our actions are aimed to drive transformational improvements at IP and create significant value for our shareholders. I'm now on to Slide 6. I'm excited to share we are investing in a greenfield state-of-the-art corrugated box facility in Waterloo, Iowa. This is a great example of the investments we're making as we continue with our ambitious plans to optimize our mill-to-box system and generate attractive returns. This world-class box plant is designed to deliver on our strategy, 20% lower cost, designed in product quality and just-in-time service. All of this is aligned to a geography and end markets where we are positioned to win. The facility will be strategically located close to some of our best customers, specifically in the protein segment, while being in a freight advantage distance from one of our mills. The plan is to start construction this year and targeting for a start-up in 2026. So again, it's a best-in-class facility designed specifically to delight our customers, achieve a low-cost position to drive profitable growth. In addition to Waterloo, we're also acquiring a bulk plant in West Monroe, Louisiana. This additional capacity and expanded capabilities will allow us to grow our specialty business in an attractive market. As you know, bulk is a business where we are differentiated and have a very good performance track record. We anticipate closing this deal tomorrow. So now let's turn to our full year performance. First, I'll share some highlights, and then I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through the details. I'm now on Slide 8. Our full year results came in line with our outlook. Relative to prior year performance, higher pricing was more than offset by higher costs than expected volume losses from our commercial strategy, just as we expected. We have seen significant price improvements in our North American packaging business from our go-to-market execution and favorable price index moves. Volume came in lower, but very much in line with our expectations. And again, we're seeing that in January. This period-over-period volume declines from our packaging contract restructuring is playing out in line with our predictions, which is giving us good line of sight on when we will see an inflection point to profitable market share growth. Costs were higher due to employee incentive compensation and were impacted by reliability issues at some of our mills. As I shared before, we are laser-focused on improving reliability and taking cost out of the system. As we look to 2025, I want to note that we're not going to go into detail on the outlook for this year. As you may recall, while our combination with DS Smith remains pending, certain U.K. rules constrain our ability to provide a profit forecast. Even though we are looking forward to closing the transaction tomorrow, today, we are still subject to those rules, which limit what I can say. Our plan is to provide you with our outlook and a detailed road map at our Investor Day coming up in March. But at a high level, 2025 is expected to be a transformational year. During the first few months, we anticipate earnings will continue with the stabilization trend and then we expect our earnings to progressively ramp from a combination of the cost actions already announced, further improvements throughout the year, sequentially improving commercial wins and overall benefits of our 80/20 implementation. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mark, who's going to provide more details on our fourth quarter performance and outlook. Mark Nellessen : Thank you, Andy. So turning to our fourth quarter key financials on Slide 9. Operating earnings per share came in slightly better than the outlook we provided last quarter. Our EBITDA margin came in slightly better sequentially. And overall, we see stable to improving results on a sequential basis. Our free cash flow was impacted primarily by changes in working capital as well as sequentially higher capital spending and DS Smith-related transaction costs. We could turn to Slide 10, and I can provide more details about the fourth quarter as we walk through the sequential earnings bridges. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings per share was negative $0.02 as compared to $0.44 in the third quarter. As expected, accelerated depreciation expense was a significant impact in the fourth quarter due to previously announced facility closures accounting for $0.56 per share. Price and mix was higher by $0.12 per share, driven by the flow-through of prior price index movements and mix benefits in our packaging business. Volume was unfavorable by $0.08 per share due to 2 fewer shipping days in North America box as well as some volume trade-offs related to commercial contract restructuring actions. Deploying our commercial strategies across the portfolio continue to impact volumes as we closed out the year as we expected. Operations and costs was unfavorable by $0.11 per share sequentially. This is largely the impact of seasonally higher costs as well as a step down in insurance recovery related to the Ixtac box plant fire and some reliability events in our mill system across both businesses. Maintenance outages were higher by $6 million or $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter and input costs were favorable by $0.06 per share sequentially, mainly driven by lower cost for OCC and wood. And finally, corporate items favorably impacted earnings by $0.12 per share sequentially, primarily due to lower taxes. Turning to the segments and starting with the Industrial Packaging's fourth quarter results on Slide 11. Price and mix was higher by $63 million due to the realization of approximately $40 million of benefits from prior index movement along with additional benefits from our containerboard board export and open market sales. We saw a mix improvement in both North America and Europe. Volume was lower by $24 million sequentially due to 2 fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made choices based on our box go-to-market strategy that negatively impacted our volume as expected, but this will allow us to improve our margins and mix over the long term. Operations and costs was $22 million unfavorable sequentially primarily due to the impact of seasonally higher costs, a step down in the Ixtac insurance proceeds, which we received $25 million in the third quarter to $12 million in the fourth quarter and some reliability events in our mill system. Planned maintenance outages were lower by $22 million sequentially and input costs were $20 million favorable, primarily due to lower OCC and wood costs. And accelerated depreciation decreased earnings by $9 million due to the 5 packaging facility closures in the fourth quarter. Moving on to fourth quarter results for Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 12. Price and mix was sequentially lower by $13 million due to price index movement. Volume sequentially was lower by $8 million in the quarter due to the Georgetown mill closure in early December as well as a pull-forward of orders in the prior quarter as customers anticipated a potential port strike. Operations and costs was unfavorable sequentially by $23 million which includes unabsorbed fix costs from the Georgetown mill closure, some reliability issues and higher seasonal costs. Planned maintenance outages were higher in the fourth quarter by $28 million, and input costs were $4 million favorable, primarily driven by lower wood costs. And finally, accelerated depreciation decreased earnings by $222 million, mostly due to the Georgetown mill closure in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Before we get into the details, I would remind everyone that accelerated depreciation is included in operating earnings and is called out for each business. In summary, adjusted earnings for our Industrial Packaging segment are expected to be higher sequentially by $52 million. This includes a non-repeat of accelerated D&A expense. Adjusted earnings for Global Cellulose Fibers are expected to be higher sequentially by approximately $220 million, and this also includes a non-repeat of accelerated depreciation expense in the prior quarter. Now let me give you a breakdown by business segment. I'll start with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to decrease earnings by $5 million sequentially from lower export pricing to date and unfavorable seasonal mix impact. Volume is expected to increase earnings by $10 million due to 2 more shipping days primarily. We expect operations and costs to increase earnings by $30 million. This includes benefits from our box plant optimization as well as non-repeats related to incentive compensation and other items from the prior quarter. It also includes the unfavorable impact of wage inflation. We expect accelerated depreciation will increase earnings for the packaging business by approximately $11 million because of the expense related to the 5 packaging facility closures that occurred in the fourth quarter. Lower maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings by $6 million. And lastly, we expect input costs to remain flat overall with higher energy costs offsetting lower OCC prices. Switching to Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease earnings by approximately $10 million as a result of prior index movement. Volume is expected to be stable, and we expect operations and costs to increase earnings by approximately $35 million. This includes improved performance and reliability as well as non-repeats related to incentive compensation and other items from the prior quarter. We expect accelerated depreciation will increase earnings for the pulp business by approximately $222 million because of the expense related to the closure of Georgetown mill in the fourth quarter. Higher plant maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease earnings in the fourth quarter by approximately $26 million. And lastly, input costs are expected to be stable. With that, let me turn it back over to Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mark. We'll now turn to Slide 14. I'm excited to remind everybody that we'll be hosting our Investor Day in New York on March 25 where we will provide an in-depth review of our strategy, business and financial objectives for the new IP. We'll share our progress on DS Smith integration and outlook, the detailed plan for North American packaging and how 80/20 deployment across the company will help drive profitable growth. Our goal is to provide a very detailed, clear and time-based path forward. With that, operator, let's now pause and take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : I appreciate in the comments you made it clear that the volumes in the fourth quarter were pretty much in line with what you had expected. Obviously, they were pretty big year-over-year declines. And I think that in the past, you've talked about that there would still be negative year-over-year for the -- maybe through the middle of next year and then things stabilize and potentially move positive in the second half. Is that still kind of a reasonable game plan? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, Mark, absolutely. So we certainly don't like the reality of the results in the fourth quarter. It is exactly what we had expected. And so when I -- when you look at the volume drops off on year-over-year, it is -- when you net out kind of wins and losses, 100% of what we're seeing is the expected from the contract process that we've been going through in the last 18 months to 2 years. And so it's right on track. And I think importantly, right, as we look at January, January is right on track in terms of what we're seeing for day rates. And so what you should expect to see is that bottom of the third quarter and fourth quarter, it will step up, meaning a less year-over-year loss in the first quarter, less year-over-year loss again sequentially in the second quarter. And then as we get into the back half, when exactly we break that 0 point, I don't know if it's going to be exactly the third quarter or not, but it's somewhere in there. But in that second half, we expect it to crest these choices. So I'm going to knock on wood, but that feels good. The other thing I'd add to that, Mark, is if you look at the investments that we've been making on the box plant side for reliability, I think very importantly, that is now showing up in internal and external data. So if you look at the data from our on-time delivery metrics, our service metrics and then you also look at -- we do a third-party validated NPS, I also saw another third-party benchmark last week. We have clearly moved very significantly from a service perspective in the minds of our customer. And the reason that's important is we're now starting to quote pieces of business that we didn't have the opportunity to quote a year ago. And so we've got some pretty decent-sized chunks of business. Not much of it is baked into our expectations for the year, but we've got some pretty decent-sized chunks of contracts that are now rolling off where we think we're putting a very attractive value proposition. So we're moving from a very defensive posture relative to the commercial side of the business to slowly moving to an offensive posture. And I want to say slowly because we still have to finish digging out that hole, and we've got to win some of these businesses. But I like where we are relative to our plan. When you look into our sales pipeline, that pipeline and what's happening on a daily basis is now showing signs of congruity. And I like the fact that we're starting to quote some business that we didn't have the opportunity in the last year or two. Mark Weintraub : Great. And maybe kind of following up along the lines of the response to the question. I think you also mentioned like a $350 million lack of productivity, reliability type of thing. Can you maybe provide more color on specifically what you meant by that? And do we get that back? And what are the actions that are being taken currently? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So Mark, actually, I think this is a linchpin, right? So going back to my days at Danaher, running a sub-plant -- sub-manufacturing plant, right? You're always looking for the bottlenecks to the key of your strategy or the key of your execution. And so it took me a little while to get in and understand kind of exactly what was going on, but I'll simplify in 2 ways. One is we've been living in a world of less capacity for too long. And because of that, and it makes you soft, it's kind of like an athlete who sits on the couch for a couple of years. It makes you soft. And so as we have started to push part of our operations. And when I say that, pushing them in terms of moving volume to assets that we need to have be A+. We're pushing that. And so -- and what that's showing is it's showing the mill capability. And we've got a few mills that we've got some serious work to do. And when you add that up, that's darn near a couple of hundred million dollars a year in potential, right? So you're having to keep way too much cost in your system because, frankly, if you go back and you do the root cause analysis, which we have, it comes back to 2 things. It comes back to underspending for a very long period of time. It's not a year or 2, right? It's underspending on basic reliability stuff in the mills. And so as you can imagine, right, your kind of -- your plan is constantly changing, the bogey is changing for those teams, and they're having to run roughshod. And the second thing, right, we are -- we have experienced and everybody in our industry and everybody in manufacturing is experiencing is a pretty significant changeover of people. And so as you -- as experience starts to change in those mills, and you combine those 2 things together, it can make it a less reliable day-to-day. And so our focus is very much on maintenance investment and reliability spend, capital and expense, and it is on rapid training for leaders who are new to a position. And so you really got a focus there. And the good part about that, right, is you can count this. And what I mean by that is you can see the amount of -- if you think of kind of mill performance as the benchmark of where you are in terms of your ability to absorb the overhead and produce, we can see this pretty tightly. And so making those investments, and that's a linchpin to the rest of our strategy of getting costs out of the system. The second part to it really comes around productivity. And what I mean by that is in any manufacturing world, the goal should be to offset your, what I'll call, internal productivity. So I don't mean input costs, right? I'm talking about the wage, maintenance, those pieces of normal inflation, you've got to drive to offset that. And in my experience, we've been able to do that in the companies that I've worked for. We're seeing it already in some of the very focused work that we're doing. I'll use the box plant lighthouses or now -- we called them pilots, we now call them lighthouses, as the example. But as you know, this is a very high contribution margin business. And so as you drive productivity, you can take significant cost out and/or as you move volume over a different set of assets, the contribution margins are just really high. That's something we haven't done. Again, that's when you think about keeping too much capacity that ends up as EDT, that's how it shows up. And so we believe that absolutely can go after that. You don't -- look, you're not going to get it overnight. But in the time frames that we're talking about in terms of both driving the day-to-day excellence of execution and then having the productivity flywheel moving. It's $300 million to $400 million. It's a lot of money. And so yes, we can get it back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Phil Ng : Andy, appreciate all the great color. I thought the slide deck was pretty awesome, it had a lot of great color in terms of things that you guys have done already on the cost to commercial action side of things. You also gave us a look at what's still to come, more on the to-do list with items like mill and box system structural cost-out efforts, reducing organizational complexity and expanding the sales force. So appreciating 1Q is kind of a stabilization period. And you kind of pointed out earnings momentum, transformation 2025, so kind of help us think through how that could kind of layer through this year, some of these actions, whether it's all in the cost or commercial side, and think about the earnings momentum as the year progresses. You talked about the $300 million to $400 million that you -- was a drag. I mean, how quickly can we get some of that back, I guess? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So Phil, great question. I think as we think about this year playing out, that the cost stuff that we announced last quarter, as you can imagine, right, making that real through the fourth quarter of the year that then starts to layer in throughout the year. And so you should see that kind of sequentially ramp as people who are no longer going to be with the company, assets that have been closed. As you know, you don't just close an asset and all the costs go away, there's a tail to that. And so we have to move in through that tail. That gets better as the year goes on. And then we have an expectation that we're going to continue to drive cost aggressively as we go through the year. And you should expect us -- the thing that I would be looking for if I'm you is a quarterly drumbeat of actions, right? That's what you need to see and obviously, it needs to show up in the P&L and in the balance sheet and ultimately, cash flow. And so on the cost side, right, we've got a road map that we've laid out. We've had to be pretty selective about how we could talk about that with all of you because of the DS Smith process. That restraint comes off. And so at the Investor Day, the intention is to show a much more clear road map, obviously, being respectful of all of our stakeholders in the process. So you should expect to see that ramp. And then on the commercial side, really, if you look at what's baked in right now on the commercial side, is the pricing that we have today, right? We haven't adjusted for any future index changes. We have no idea, right, what's going to happen with that. So we don't have any expectation there. So it's the prices that we're going to market with today, plus if you kind of think through our expected pipeline. So there is no kind of major expectation of giant wins that's in our outlook for this year, so just to be clear. So the reality of that, and you guys know this as well as anybody, turnarounds take time and they're not linear. And so if you think of it, think of it as a run chart, right, as you go into one of our mills and you see process run charts all the time, right? The tolerances are wide right now. There's a lot of variation. And our job is to squeeze that variation in every way, right? We're trying to squeeze the variation in what causes kind of these wild changes to -- in parts of our business that, frankly, we don't think should be as volatile. We're making changes to those things and then you've got to execute. And what I said in my prepared remarks, this is where the hard work begins. I mean this is where you are in the muck, you have to be. These things happen at a box plant, at a mill, right? They don't happen in the ether. And so really getting to incredibly disciplined cause and effect where I'm pulling a certain lever, and that is going to take the cost out or it's going to win a customer. That's where we are. And so we certainly have a plan for how that ramps throughout the year. I'm very aware -- look, I've looked at hundreds of businesses and business plans over the years, and whenever you see an aggressive track like this, you have to discount it, right? You have to be smart about that. So we have to make consistent progress quarter-over-quarter. We need to exit this year substantially better than where we ran last year and where we ran this year. A couple of things that I see as really encouraging. So if you look at the North American packaging solutions business exclusively, and you look at where they're tracking relative to where Tom Hamic and team said they would be tracking on the commercial side, we feel really good, on the investments that we've made into the box plant business and the expected improvements on service improvements has absolutely shown up. And we have moved an entire standard deviation in performance and customer service performance in the last year. And that is a big deal. And so we've seen that. And we've also seen what that means to specific customers. I'm spending time with specific customers talking about their experience with us. We're now getting on site with customers and doing joint innovation sessions, but we're pushing -- we're starting to push those envelopes, more than we have in the past. But this is where, look, this is where it's a knife fight. At the end of the day, that's what this is. And we're in execution mode now. Phil Ng : Okay. That's super helpful. I guess you gave us the road map today in terms of CapEx spend. It's great you're reinvesting in your growth products or box plants. You're stepping up maintenance and reliability and doing great things on the sales force front. Is this a level in terms of capital spend and maintenance operating spend that could be steady state from here? Or should we kind of accept that to step up the next few years as you kind of move forward? Or how should we think about these moving pieces? Andrew Silvernail : Phil, if I had a magic wand, meaning I had the ability to spend it, meaning the performance of the business was where I wanted it to be and we had the capability to effectively spend the money, I would spend more, I would. And the reason we're targeting this $1.2 billion as it matches what we think the organization can actually effectively execute and where we are relative to the turnaround of the business. But look, I think as we perform, we will address aggressively -- we will invest aggressively over the next few years. And a -- it's really kind of a combination of things, Phil. One is we got to close the gap on a number of things that we've had. When you make decisions around nonstrategic assets, and you incrementally increase spending, right? So if you think of both those things happening at the same time, what happens is you radically increase the spending on the strategic assets. It's not a small change. It's -- you're not talking about 5% and 10% and 20%, you're talking about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% in some areas. And we're going to have to do that for a few years because look, we dug a hole over a decade, we're not going to fill it in a quarter. And so we've got to make those choices and visual -- and maybe this will help folks, is a visual that I've been using is think of the demand of the packaging business over a cycle. So if you just think of it as what does demand really look like of a packaging business over a cycle. It's about 1%, 1.5% volume increase through a cycle. And that changes to kind of a plus 2 -- plus 2 points to that, so call it plus 3 to minus 1 or so, or minus 2 or so, somewhere in that range. That's kind of the range in any given year of actual consumer demand and when I say consumer, consumer and industrial demand of our product, but investment trends, profit trends historically have been highly volatile, right? And then people react to that, and they make the investment trends even more volatile. So if you think in a very simple way of what we're trying to do right here, is we're trying to cut off volatility, we're trying to sand the board on the top side and on the bottom side, right? Take volatility out. And when you look at GCF as an example, I love the GCF business, but it's volatile. It just -- it's more volatile than our core packaging business. There are other parts of our business that are relatively low profit that are pretty volatile. And as you start to move towards your core integrated packaging business, that volatility goes down. And then if you match your investment plan with what your real trend line looks like, you take out more volatility. When you chase the trend line with investments, you -- our box plant managers, our mill managers, they can't plan to be successful if they're reacting in quarters, they've got to have 18 months or so on the maintenance side or probably 3 years plus on the capital side. And that's got to be consistent, and we haven't allowed them to put them in a position to be successful. And I apologize for the length of this answer, but I can't tell you how passionate I am about this. We have to consistently invest in being great, we have a hole to fill. We're going to fill that hole, and we are going to be much more consistent in our capital investment. And everything flows with capital investment in this business. And what I mean by that, look, I spent 3 days last week, personally 3 days in a Kaizen event, looking at our capital investment process. And I -- look, no offense to anybody, it's a ludicrous process that we have right now. And we are radically changing it in terms of time, in terms of responsibility, in terms of who has authority and signing responsibility and we will dramatically change that time line. And then changing that time line, we take the handcuffs off of our people. And it's not just the dollars invested, right? It's because everybody is attached to that. You've got literally thousands of people who are chasing things that are unproductive and those people could be working with our customers on innovation. They could be working on productivity, right? And we need to take the handcuffs off our people and allow them to freaking run. And so -- I'm sorry, that one gets me worked up. So I'm pretty passionate about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Congrats on all the progress, and obviously -- and a congrats on the passion as well. And Mark, Jose, congrats on your new roles. Just wanted to quickly follow up on what was mentioned in terms of the regional portfolio. Coming up from a different angle, you mentioned in the press release, one of your objectives for 2025 is to balance capacity to your demand, so I'm wondering can you help us at least maybe -- just speaking generalities, if you can, what type of capacity moves you have in mind? Is it more of what you've mentioned in previous responses in terms of transferring production? Is it a matter of maybe closing mills that are higher cost in an efficient way, where -- require too much capital to fix at this point? Can you help us frame like what kind of capacity realignment you're in anticipating? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So Mike, I'm going to give you an answer that's only going to be partially satisfying because of the 2 things. One, we do have some minimal restrictions and also, I think as we talk about assets and locations, we need to do that the right way at the right time. So I have to be a little bit opaque around that. So I apologize if that's just the right thing to do. So I want to say -- let's just step back for a second and think of it as you think of our entire business and you think of the quality of earnings across the spectrum of that business, right, it's pretty wide from one market segment and one product to another market segment and another product. That -- those core earnings are -- there's a pretty wide band on that. When you look at the portion of our business that isn't as profitable or frankly, maybe negative, and then you align that against assets that really have pretty poor returns, when you put those 2 things together, that's -- those are tough chunks of things to look at, right? And when you put them together, there's no path to that being super successful. And so you've got to move your investment to the customers, the products and the assets and the people who are going to allow you to win. And that's the process that we've been going before. And when we talked about kind of a whole slew of that in the third quarter, that's what that was all about. As we move through this year, we will absolutely continue to move down that path. And we've got to do it in both the box system and in the mill system. And we just kind of think about the ability to do what I would -- just kind of got fired up about a few moments ago, to do that, you can't peanut butter spread investments, right? You have to move investment. It's 80/20 thinking at its most foundational, which is you've got to move your resources, your money, your people, your energy towards those things where you can have a differentiated position. And the cool part is if you look at our box network in the United States and throughout North America, and you look at where we are positioned across the country and then you compare that to the competitive set, we feel really good about that. Now we know we have to change that because we have places that frankly have too much capacity and there's too much to -- it's got a crazy marketplace, right? And you got too much there, and you got places where you don't have enough. And so in the places where you don't have enough like Waterloo, Iowa, we're going to be super aggressive. So greenfields, brownfields, the lighthouses that we're talking about, the demand is there, and we can't satisfy the demand because we don't have enough capacity. And in some other places where it's not, we need to first focus in on niches of -- subniches of markets where we're really good, and we can win, and we can win in that subniche and have a great sustainable competitive position in that subniche. And then in places where, frankly, it doesn't make economic sense, we need to make other decisions. On the mill side, when you think about the mills, I grew up and as you guys know, I grew up in a mill town. And so these conversations have been in my blood since I was 8 years old. And you have to invest, right? You have to invest on a consistent basis in mills. And of course, the older they get, you have to make sure you keep them primed. And for those of -- anyone who is interested in cars, look, there are 40- and 50-year-old cars that run great, but they're not as competitive as the car you're going to buy off the lot tomorrow. And so you're constantly looking at where that is, when do I continue to invest and when do I not? And you have to be able to do that in a very clear mature way because all of our stakeholders require them, right? So if you think about our people, our customers and our shareholders as the 3 principal stakeholders, I'm a big believer that none of them can win over the others in any long period of time before it damages all of them. And so to make those investments in the business, it absolutely makes our business competitive. It creates very stable, attractive jobs for our people. We win with our customers because we offer them the kind of service and reliability and innovation they want at a fair price. We take the cost out of the system, which gives us the margin to reinvest back. And ultimately, right, that turns into profitable growth for our owners. And so that highly dependent system of stakeholders is what we're driving in. Mike Roxland : Got it. And just one quick follow-up. Just there are obviously, a lot of changes in a very short period of time that -- it's interesting for a company that has had a really entrenched corporate culture. Just trying to get a sense from you whether is there's been any pushback, any resistance? And what are you may do to sort of like grease the wheel to encourage bias? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, great question. Look, I have been thoroughly impressed with how people have grabbed on to the change. There was an enormous pent-up demand in this company for change. And look, the people are great. To be candid, right, when I was considering this role, one of the thoughts I had to myself is, wow, how good can the people be with the performance we've had, and I have been absolutely delighted. We have smart, capable, driven people who want to win. That being said, right, in a business like ours, there are a handful of very, very big decisions that get made that either enable or disable the organization to win, capital is a huge one, right? When you are spreading your capital thin, you are basically telling your people to play whack-a-mole, they don't have another choice. So when you make -- when you don't make the courageous decisions, that's what happens. When you have capital decisions that take an ungodly long period of time, it ties up thousands of people in non-value-added processes. If you grab any one of our mill managers and you were to ask her or him, what does it take to win? They know, they know. And we have, in many ways, handcuffed them with decisions on capital investment, with decisions that are very bureaucratic and frankly, not setting and upholding very high expectations, right? The reality Is, is -- one of the things that I'm trying to do with this call as an example, is I believe there ought to be perfect alignment between our owners, our Board, the management team and everybody who works in this company. There should be no daylight between the expectations of action and the expectations of performance between anybody. And look, a lot of people complain about having to do these kind of things and do quarterly calls. I think they're great. I grew up getting a report card, you get a report card and you got to go home, and you got to talk about why you got an A or why you got a D? And there's no hiding. And I love it. I grew up playing sports, scoreboards are great, right? You are what the scoreboard says you are. There is no confusion in this organization about what the scoreboard says we have been. No confusion at all. And our goal is to be one heck of a lot better. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mat McKellar from RBC Capital Markets. Mat McKellar : I'd like to start asking about the Waterloo greenfield box plant, are you able to provide any additional color on what kind of CapEx you're anticipating for that plant? And then how you would think about an attractive return for this type of project, please? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So we're not -- we haven't disclosed anything today. We'll put a lot more color to that. This will be an item that we'll talk about certainly at the Investor Day. Obviously, it's a very large investment. It's by far the largest box plant investment we have ever made. And my expectation is this is going to be something that we should be driving cash-on-cash returns of about 20%, right? That's the kind of thing. And I mean the total cost, not just on the investment purely for that thing. But if you look at through the value chain from an integrated perspective, that's the kind of value that we should be able to add from a kind of investment like this. And what I love about this investment. And we also see, as we've got some more that we're looking at that are like this, obviously, not a ton of them, but some more that makes sense, and we're looking at some brownfields. And if you look at the pilots. What I like about these kind of things is they bring all the elements of our strategy together, right? So in our world, we absolutely -- our goal is not to be the low-priced player, but our goal absolutely is to be the low-cost player. And we think that we have the scale and the footprint that gives us license to do that, but we have to make different choices. And a plant like Waterloo dramatically changes that. If you look at our 2 lighthouses that we have, the 2 regional lighthouses, the gains that we're getting and we're seeing encourage a heck out of us and that's why we're going to roll it out to 22 more box plants here in 2025 and then we'll keep going, right? The goal is over the next few years, is to a completely reconfigure our box plant network. And look, this is a harsh thing to say, but for a long time, we thought of our box plants as kind of a dumping ground for paper. That's kind of how we treated it. And the bottom line is it is the front end of our business. It's more like a retail shop than other things, right, where you want to be super -- great service levels, very reactive to customers and make sure that we're employing our 80/20 mindset as close to the customers as possible. And so we're super excited about Waterloo. We'll give you more detail here at the Investor Day about it. And we're also excited about the bulk plant, right? That's another example of a different type of strategic thought that's unlocking one of the pieces of great value that we see in the company, which is in specialty. And we're excited about that acquisition. It fits us well. It's small, but it enables us in a great way, and it also helps us move fast which is a great enabler. Mat McKellar : That's helpful. If I could just follow up with one more on the box plants. As you sort of scale your approach from your first 2 lighthouses to the incremental 22 in 2025, are you anticipating pretty similar improvements in productivity? Does that change at all versus the first -- what you achieved at the first couple? And then does that change at all again as you kind of target the next batch in '26 and beyond? Andrew Silvernail : I do expect the same kind of results, right? And I think it's important to note that the results that we're seeing are really -- are not being driven by dramatic capital investment, right? The results we're getting in these 2 places so far are really around what I think of as the volume mix matrix, right? So as you think about complexity, the key to what we're doing is isolating complexity, right? So we're putting a lot of complexity in a few box plants where they become experts at that complex product customer configuration. And then other places where you can almost run lights out, it's really -- it's those 2 -- it's that combination that we're getting the kind of productivity that we're seeing. When you enable it with CapEx, there's more to come. That being said, the gains will not be -- again, I use the term linear, meaning we're not going to get the exact same kind of gains everywhere. There will be places that we get more, and you want to enable it with more CapEx. And there will be places where you won't get the 20% or 30% because you don't have the same configuration in a geography, right? So I think we're going to get really substantial productivity improvements. We also -- I want to -- I'd like to roll this out lighting speed, but you got to be mindful of it, right? You can't just throw ideas at folks, you've got to go hand-in-hand with them, make the changes, right? So you have to make the volume mix changes. You've got to make those changes where you want to consolidate a box plant and then have the remaining box plants take that on and people who want to move over to those things, to the box plants, can. You want to be able to do that. You want to install daily management and make sure that, that's working. And before you kind of ride off to the sunset to another thing. So it's kind of the old saying, go slow, you're in a hurry because you want it to stick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Muir-Sands with BNP Paribas. Charlie Muir-Sands: Just sticking with the rollout of the lighthouse strategy for a minute. So can I just clarify, that is the one that you think can unlock around $300 million to $400 million of cost [indiscernible] productivity? Andrew Silvernail : No. I think what -- that was not the main focus of that. That was really around -- I think you've got, call it, $175 million to $200 million of just, I'm going to call it, mill reliability, right? So that's just -- that's very much in the mills. And then the balance is productivity. A lot in the mills, but also in the box plants. And what I'm talking about there, Charlie, is my experience has been as you get a productivity engine humming to be able to offset things like wage inflation benefits and other, what I'll call it, internal inflation, so not your input cost. We don't do that well, right? And if you look at our financials and you go back over 5 or 10 years, and you actually look at the destruction of value, the 2 big linchpins you see are, I'm going to call it, reliability that showed up at the customer, which then had become a headwind from a volume perspective, but also it ends up driving a lot of cost. So I looked at some analytics over the last couple of weeks, if you look in our mill system as an example, and you follow long-term maintenance spend relative to replacement asset value. So if you just kind of follow that, what you see is a building gap over time. But that doesn't mean that your costs went down because what ends up happening is your costs shift from being capital to being expense. And so if you actually stack capital and expense together, we're actually spending more combined today than we were 5 or 10 years ago because of that choice. And that kind of comes down to that car analogy. If I don't change my oil, I'm going to eventually going to lose my engine and that -- losing your engine costs a hell of a lot more than changing the oil and that's kind of what we run into. And so now we're doing some pretty rapid engine rebuilds. That's the way to think about it. But the productivity engine is something that's going to be going all the time, right? And if you think of just the math on it, you're talking about 2% to 3% per year is what you got to get. You got to get 2% to 3% per year, and that will offset your internal inflation. And that -- I know in a world where people talk about, I need 5% year-over-year. Well, you guys know the truth. Very few people get 5% year-over-year. What you really do is you liberate capacity, right? Yes, I can shut nonstrategic assets, you get a benefit from that. But then you liberate capacity. And in our world, when you liberate capacity and you get volume growth of any kind, it flows through a ridiculously high levels. And so the early stages of this are actually the costs coming out. And as you think of this kind of a couple of years from now, what you want is that engine of productivity that our mill managers, our box plant leaders are thinking about that and they're thinking of productivity on a 2- to 3-year rolling cycle, not I'm showing up in December, and I've got a budget for next year, I got to figure it out. Those are very different approaches. Charlie Muir-Sands: So the rollout of the lighthouse strategy doesn't necessarily deliver immediate P&L benefits and tailwinds [indiscernible] volumes. You actually absorb that extra capacity, or you can put a dollar value against that as well. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. If you look at what we've done in the 2 lighthouse regions that we've been in, we have closed 2 box plants, right? So we've actually closed 2 box plants and consolidated the volume into the other lighthouses while taking on-time delivery and service levels meaningfully up. So when you look at the actual, it's real productivity, it's real dollars, right? And so you get it first because you're taking out the overhead of the stranded capacity. And then you're also driving continuous improvement as you bring that volume in. And so it kind of starts off with a big bang. If you think of us -- think of IP in a microcosm in one of these regions, that's exactly what we're talking about, right? You're taking out cost that's effectively stranded cost, unneeded cost, you're matching the volume mix matrix correctly. So those businesses are coming more effective. And then over time, you're driving that drumbeat of productivity, right? So it's a big bolus that we have to get in the box plant side and in the mill side and then you have to build the muscle of ongoing productivity going forward. Charlie Muir-Sands: Right. And sorry, just one more question. I think historically, you've guided annual corporate expense. I know that there has been a big restructuring of cost savings, you've devolved a lot of the staff headcount to the segments, but I just wondered what we should understand as being the figure now for 2025. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I don't think we're calling it out very specifically. But the way you should think about it is as we go into 2025, you're going to see the reallocated -- cost reallocations as appropriate back to the businesses of where they actually sit. So you'll see some ups and downs. So as an example, you'll see the North American packaging business was not probably getting enough of the load, where more of it was being pushed to other GCF in our EMEA business and we'll get that balance right. But in total, right, the central costs are going down precipitously, right? They're going to go down by $120 million from the actions that we've outlined. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe Hajde : I want to try to put some numbers to what we're talking about and go back to the presentation that you gave us on the Q2 call. I think in that presentation, you indicated that you underspent sort of a peer group by 1.5% on CapEx and maintenance, I think it was $0.40 per 1,000 square feet. But... Andrew Silvernail : Yes, don't have it in front of me, but that sounds right, yes. Gabe Hajde : Okay. And you're talking a lot about mill reliability and some underinvestment over time. And I sort of -- I like your analogy. So I'm thinking about running a 0.25 mile -- or 1-mile race and I'm a 0.25 mile behind, it's really tough to catch up. So the number, I think, that we saw thrown out there was $260 million for this new investment from local government agencies, et cetera, so Waterloo that is. So this year, you're going to spend about another $1 billion, maybe a little bit less. When should we expect that IP starts to catch up that $1.2 billion of underspend? And do you feel like, as you look across these metrics that you're talking about that you're falling further behind? Andrew Silvernail : No, I don't think we're falling further behind, right, because of the choices that we're making on reallocation of where that other money is going is a big change, right? So if you just took a peanut butter spread, I would agree with what I think, I'm going to call it, your concern, right, which is if you were just going to leave it the same, yes, that would be 100% to true, right? I just did Waterloo, and I did everything the way I did it in the past, that would be true. But you can see from the actions we've already announced that is not the intention and you can expect to see us make some other choices here readily around that. And so as we think about that application, so you got to think of it as you're going to move your investment towards your strategic assets, that's already started. And that's a good-sized number. So the total time frame to make up the whole, I think, is about 3 years to make up the whole. That's -- and look, again, I'd do it faster, but I don't think we could spend it faster effectively, right? And if you just look at lead times in terms of equipment and whatnot, I think it's a 3-year march. That's my opinion. Mark, any thoughts there? Mark Nellessen : I would agree with that. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, yes. Gabe Hajde : I appreciate that. I mean it's sometimes like pushing on a string, it's you now have the resources to enable it. Understood. Okay, maybe more... Andrew Silvernail : I think it's -- before you go, what's really important, though, right, is this dynamic resource allocation is really, really important, right, moving it away from places that don't deserve it, that don't make money, that you're not going to win in, to places where that is true, right? They do deserve it, you can win there. And the difference in returns on capital are gigantic in those choices. And so if you think of a bell curve of ROIC for these investments, right? Oftentimes, people think about things like safety investment or maintenance investment as on the left-hand side, meaning not very attractive, right? And I look at it completely the opposite. They're on the far right-hand side of that. They are everything. And so you have to have stability before you can have improvement. And so, so much of the work that we did last year, and we're still doing today is around stability, and then it gives you a chance to drive improvement. Gabe Hajde : Got it. I want to be respectful of everyone's time. But the last one, you talked about report cards, scorecards. Near term, just to be clear, Mark, it wasn't in the Q1 Industrial Packaging view, you are not including any price as it relates to the January increases because it was not reflected in RISI or how should we think about that? Andrew Silvernail : No, we are not including that. Thank you very much. Well, thank you, everybody. Appreciate your time today. Appreciate your interest in IP. I want to thank the teams for just a herculean effort that they are putting in and the commitment that people are showing to grabbing on to doing these tough things, right? Doing hard things is what we have to do. That should be our motto, do hard things. And that's what the team is doing. So I'm very proud of how we're tackling that. And I appreciate your interest. So I look forward to seeing you on March 25, at the Investor Day and laying out a lot more detail. So take care, everybody.
